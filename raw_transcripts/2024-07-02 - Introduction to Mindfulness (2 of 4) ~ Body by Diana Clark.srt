1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,680
so I was saying that mindfulness is a noticing practice and part of the premise of this

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,200
is that we can choose like you know that which we are noticing we can move our

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:21,400
attention and in some ways this means that anything absolutely

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:27,439
anything can be like the object of mindfulness sometimes like when we come

5
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,160
to a meditation center we see a teacher who sitting on a floor in a particular posture and we're going to instruct you

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:40,360
to do that there's this way we might think like oh well mindfulness has to be look a certain way or has to be done a

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,640
certain way but it doesn't have to be that way it's something that definitely

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:53,280
is portable that we can bring to our daily life to anything that we're doing but mindfulness of

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,239
the of the breath is often where we start and we often use this as the

10
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:06,479
primary anchor and what I mean by that by anchor is just you know some place where we're placing our attention so

11
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:13,360
just the breath and then of course like the Mind likes to wander and then we just very simply come back to the

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,240
breath some of the advantages of using the breath is that it's changing and

13
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,439
moving and there's something that's a little bit more interesting for the mind to be paying attention to something

14
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:32,479
that's moving there's more I can say about the breath

15
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,520
but I I'll stop there for now and also last time we talked about the

16
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,720
posture and how it can be really helpful to have an upright

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,840
posture in a way that you know expresses some uprightness but you know our

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,640
intention to meditate Our intention

19
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,360
to be specific with where we're placing the mind

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,239
and some have some alertness and this this is a a practice

21
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,080
in itself I would say to have this sense of uprightness and ease sometimes we

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,800
have this you know we feel like first we have to be stiff and if we come off of the back rest in a chair there's a

23
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,760
certain stiffness that can happen and it feels uh maybe stilted or forced in some kind of

24
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,519
way and I would say for uh actually I don't it's already I was going to say do

25
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,720
I know anybody yes I do know some people that from the beginning was no problem you know just to be in a meditation

26
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:44,920
posture but for many of us that's not the case like to be in a meditation posture is uh difficult or a little bit

27
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,000
uh uncomfortable and I just want to name that and I'll just say I think I said

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,040
this last time too but for me there is no way I could sit for more than like

29
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,400
you know 10 or 15 minutes it's not that I set out intentionally to try to be better at my

30
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:11,319
meditation posture it just happened I'm just meditating more and more it just got easier and easier so I'll just offer

31
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:18,560
that and so there are a few ways that we can teach

32
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,040
mindfulness so many different ways and here at IMC we tend to do it in a particular

33
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,280
way other ways are perfectly legitimate but uh this way is

34
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,360
if you can imagine a concentric circles that are like going out and in the

35
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,480
center is uh the breath and where the reason and it's the breath it's in the

36
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,560
center because it's often the most stable and maybe the most reliable and

37
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,480
accessible not always and not for everybody this is a generalization and then we would say

38
00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:00,200
like one ring outside is uh the body mindfulness of the body is also has some

39
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,879
stability and in some ways you know we can even merge the breath and the body but for this one I'll say the breath and

40
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,120
the body and then emotions right we get pushed around by our emotions and often

41
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,479
there's some instability and lose our presence of mind so to speak with emotions so that's the outer ring and

42
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:26,240
then I would say even more so with thoughts that uh we just get lost in our

43
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,639
thoughts in our planning and in our fantasies our memories all these

44
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:37,680
different things so we tend to focus and really

45
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,759
um draw on and refer to what's more in the center so this is the breath and the

46
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:52,560
body and the ensuing weeks I'll talk about emotions and thoughts we can be mindful of them as well but it really

47
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,400
helps to have this stability of the breath and the body so this class we start breath and the body emotions and

48
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:07,160
thoughts kind of going to the starting with the most stable to the least stable so in this way there's a certain

49
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,880
progression so I could say like you know please don't have any emotions until next

50
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,479
week or don't think don't think and you know for two weeks or something like this until we talk about it but uh of

51
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:26,070
course that's not going to happen but I just want to put that in the mix that's what's uh coming

52
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:34,520
[Applause] up and so to talk a little bit about mindfulness of the body I mean of course

53
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,639
our bodies are such an integral part of what it means to be a human being right

54
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,280
to we have these bodies however it's so easy to be

55
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,160
completely disconnected from kind like the embodied

56
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,360
experience kind of society or culture that we've created just really supports

57
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,440
this idea of here let's uh get lost in this let us entertain you so you get

58
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:11,120
completely disconnected from your body or you have to think and make sure that

59
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,199
everybody knows how smart you are so make sure that uh you are always in your

60
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:22,400
mind prepared to you know have the right response or you it's so important to get the right grades like these are the

61
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,599
kinds of messages that uh we've been receiving or maybe we've even received

62
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:36,840
messages that some that uh there's something like impure with having a body or terribly wrong

63
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,280
either we receive that from others or even with ourselves we might be telling ourselves you know that there's

64
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:51,319
something terribly wrong with our body and it's best to just ignore it because it's uncomfortable to be with the bodily

65
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:58,039
experience or we might have had some traumatic experiences that are associated with the body and we don't

66
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:04,800
want to be with the body because It's associated with those terrible things that happened and it seems safer to uh

67
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,080
just not be part of it to you know kind of like move away from the

68
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,000
body and also I would say that uh kind of as a leadup to what we'll talk about

69
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,720
next week is that the emotions are actually a partly a bodily experience

70
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,120
and often we don't want to feel our emotions so we don't really want to be

71
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:36,440
embodied so I've just given a long list to kind of like normalize why it feels like wh it we you

72
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,360
know the want to be in our minds rather than feeling embodied in some kind of

73
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,879
way like really connected with uh what the bodily experience

74
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:53,960
is so it can be a training it certainly was for me I would say this I thought I

75
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,759
was embodied but turns out I wasn't so much

76
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:07,039
I remember hearing this Dharma teacher this was years and years ago saying that uh he experienced himself now I don't

77
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:14,280
remember exactly how he said it but this was the visual that I had in my mind it's like a lollipop like a stick with a

78
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,319
head on top and just like this head just kind of brings this stick around where

79
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:29,080
it goes right this the body had just been kind of you know just some stick that I dragg around with me or something

80
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,880
so to practice with this and those of

81
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:45,480
you who are on the retreat that I taught recently will recognize this just uh bring your attention to

82
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:55,720
your left hand and just like what is the

83
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,439
experience of having a hand

84
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:08,800
what does it feel like we're not thinking about it so much

85
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,120
feeling

86
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:22,399
handedness maybe there's some tingling some

87
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:31,800
throbbing maybe there's some pressure whatever that has is

88
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,240
touching and then bring your attention to your right

89
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,839
hand how does that hand feel like from the

90
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,160
inside the experience

91
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,839
do you feel this maybe we could even say the hand experiencing

92
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:24,839
itself so with no words just

93
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:32,839
experiencing throbbing tingling maybe a sense of Vitality or energy or something

94
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:39,480
vague like that and

95
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,360
then bring to mind like some ideas thoughts you have about the mind that's

96
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,440
the hand maybe it would be better if we had

97
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,680
longer fingers so that we could play the piano better or play the guitar

98
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,639
better or maybe your hands aren't very big or too

99
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:14,360
small or too big or maybe they have veins on them

100
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:22,959
or maybe they have spots on them what are some of the ideas about your hands

101
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:31,440
and maybe some of the judgments about your [Music] hands just noticing the thoughts we have

102
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:39,600
about the hands maybe the hands should be

103
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,880
different and then coming back to just the

104
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,360
experience of the hand

105
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:09,519
feeling the tingling or the pressure maybe there's some

106
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,279
throbbing so now I'd like to open it up I'm going to end this

107
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:30,000
little exercise and just to ask you what was that like could you tell the

108
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,519
difference or what did it feel like between like experiencing the hand

109
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,839
versus thinking about the hand and especially if we have judgments about our

110
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:47,560
hands what what was that like anybody like to

111
00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:01,120
share thank you lizia I'm sorry you have to crawl all across the floor here

112
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,680
um it was interesting to me that my experience of just feeling my hands was

113
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,839
very different from thinking about them like so different and after starting

114
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:24,279
with feeling the hand then it was almost hard for me to get into thoughts about it because they seemed

115
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:30,040
very just like two entirely different worlds going on with the

116
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:37,440
really feeling the hand and then trying to think about it in an abstract way was seemed silly I don't know it

117
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,160
didn't it was interesting I hadn't experienced that before yeah do you want

118
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:50,079
to say which one was there a sense of which was more easeful like to to like feel oh yeah feeling that being in the

119
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:58,040
hand was definitely more I mean that just was nice my hands were warm they were relaxed it felt good and thinking

120
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,240
about it just seemed complicated yeah yeah it's a little more

121
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,680
busy and like trying to make something happen when you're thinking about the H instead of failing them great great

122
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,160
thank you Liz anybody else have a comment something they'd like to

123
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,319
say no okay thank

124
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,000
you so there's a few things to say first is maybe you know this already maybe

125
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,120
it's obvious already that we can be intentional we can go from the left hand to the right hand so we can you know

126
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,880
direct the attention especially you know um when we

127
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,079
are not lost in thought we can just move the attention to wherever we'd like for

128
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:54,399
it to go that's maybe the first thing the second thing is there are two

129
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:01,320
different ways to be with our experience one is to actually be feeling it and the

130
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:08,120
second is to be thinking about it but we think we're feeling it or maybe it's clear that we're thinking about it but

131
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,600
so these often can get conflated somehow like the thoughts about the experience

132
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:21,920
are really different than the experience and sometimes I like to emphasize that the experience doesn't

133
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,079
need words it's just you know you know I'm not going like we

134
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:34,480
would feel like oh it's kind of smooth or you know or um kind of like cool if

135
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:42,240
we were to use words those are like the types of words that we would use as opposed to often there's thoughts of um

136
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,399
oh was was my hand in the right position or should I move it over here or should I do something like this or I don't know

137
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,240
we have some ideas about what is happening as opposed to just being in

138
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:01,000
the experience and it turns out that uh

139
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,759
there this way that to intentionally like turn towards experience is a way

140
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:14,240
that we can like interrupt some of the um momentum that the Mind might have

141
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:23,160
about the experience because for example just make this up that uh with the hand for um I

142
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,199
took piano lessons when I was you know really I did last very long but uh I

143
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:33,360
remember sometimes when I think about my hands I think like oh yeah there was this thing that they I was trying to

144
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,440
reach different keys and they weren't uh quite long enough but notice how when I

145
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:46,279
tell that story that was how long ago that didn't that's just it's not here it's just a

146
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:52,000
it's just words completely imagination about something that

147
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,839
happened decades ago I'm still sitting here I'm still having the experience in

148
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,558
these hands but I'm kind of like thinking that I'm trying to stretch my fingers to get to wherever they were

149
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:10,959
supposed to go on the piano keyboard so there's a way in which our

150
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,038
thoughts can like pull us out of the

151
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:23,558
experience maybe that's obvious but what is sometimes not so obvious is that um

152
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:29,280
often the the thoughts that we have about particularly compelling EXP es

153
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,960
uncomfortable experiences often we don't notice them and then there's a way that it kind of

154
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,679
like compounds the compelling experience the difficult experience or the uncomfortable

155
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:49,679
experience so often there'll be like something uncomfortable and then boom this shouldn't be happening um my knee

156
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:57,880
is going to fall off if this uh stays like this or am I going to have to go to the doctors after this or will everybody

157
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,039
here if I change my posture you know something like this and then we're just

158
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:10,159
no longer with our experience and our life passes Us by why

159
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:19,559
we're lost in these thoughts so there's this way can we stay with the

160
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:25,799
Simplicity and the immediacy of this moment this

161
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:33,280
moment this moment and noticing When the Thought train has uh taken us

162
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:41,039
elsewhere 100% in our imagination right we don't go anywhere we stay right

163
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:47,080
here and then we start to just feel embodied and live with our live our life

164
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,360
in a particular way it does require a certain amount of

165
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:59,159
trust because we maybe for a lifelong have thought like I have to think about things I have to solve these problems

166
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:04,200
thinking is useful and valuable but we're doing meditation which is a

167
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:12,720
different activity so with that let's do a guided

168
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,960
meditation and if you want to stand up for a moment before we sit down you're

169
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,640
welcome to do that if you'd like to like shift your posture go from the chair to the floor or the floor to the chair or

170
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,760
something like that you're welcome to do that

171
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,240
okay so taking an alert

172
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,960
posture posture that has some uprightness

173
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,559
has some uprightness and some

174
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:25,760
ease just notice that we're here feeling the pressure against the

175
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:33,600
body from where you're sitting whether that's a chair or a

176
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,240
cushion just noticing how that

177
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:03,520
feels the back The Backs side the back of the

178
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,960
legs and the

179
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,120
feet contact with the

180
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:28,880
surface then we'll do a little bit of a body scan

181
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,120
checking in around the eyes sometimes there's tightness and

182
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,640
tension

183
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:55,240
there we don't have to do anything about the tension it might be that just simply

184
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:02,490
noticing allows there to be some softening [Applause]

185
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,039
noticing if there's any tension around the

186
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,760
jaw the shoulders allowing them to slide down the

187
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,520
back away from the

188
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,480
ears the upper

189
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,799
back lower back

190
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,480
the

191
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:20,279
chest the belly we just resting attention

192
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:36,919
and then wherever in the body that the breath is

193
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:42,080
felt whether that's the movement of the

194
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:50,440
belly the stretching around the chest or the feeling of air coming in

195
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,039
and out of the nose

196
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,600
just resting the attention on the sensations of

197
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,360
breathing feeling the experience of the breath

198
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,879
we're going to hang out here for a little bit with the breath

199
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,000
tuning into the experience of

200
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:36,440
breathing and when the mind is lost in thought we just very simply gently begin

201
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,559
again with the sensations of

202
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
breathing for

203
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:35,279
and now can you turn your attention to a

204
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,679
compelling bodily experience maybe something that's

205
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:47,840
uncomfortable pressure against the body maybe something that feels really

206
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:53,919
nice letting go with the breath and turning

207
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,799
towards this bodily experience

208
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,399
what does it feel like what is the experience what are the

209
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:07,399
sensations

210
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:45,279
and when it's no longer compelling or you find yourself lost in

211
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:54,158
thought come back to the breath in a relaxed easy manner

212
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,919
let's do that again to a compelling bodily

213
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:25,639
sensation something that draws or draws your attention

214
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,799
feeling into

215
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:46,279
it and this time notice if there's some thoughts

216
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:54,840
around it if there's a commentary around it sense of this shouldn't be there or I

217
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,919
hope this lasts I I don't know what she's talking

218
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,880
about whatever it might be we're just

219
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:14,000
noticing and then come back to the breath

220
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,440
then this way we can move back and forth between

221
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,600
compelling Sensations and the

222
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,760
breath nothing in particular needs to be

223
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:30,960
happening we're just noticing for

224
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:06,080
can you keep it simple just with the immediacy of the

225
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:12,760
experience and right now we're emphasizing the breath and the

226
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:22,919
body maybe going back and forth if need be

227
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:44,159
and being sensitive to any commentary about the experience

228
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:28,679
for this last bit here can you just hang in there with the sensations of breathing

229
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:53,550
[Music]

230
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:10,840
so it turns out that at every moment each

231
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:18,720
moment there most often there's two things happening one is an experience in the

232
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,200
body or whatever the experience might be and the second thing is the commentary

233
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,360
about that experience I like it I don't like it I'm confused about it kind of

234
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,799
maybe that's a maybe one way in a high level summary of what the the way is the

235
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:44,120
commentary that we have and there's this way in which we kind of like assume that the commentary

236
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:52,760
is just part of the commentary is often a judgment you know about whether it's good or bad desirable or not or it's uh

237
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:58,120
maybe leads then kind of like might lead into a story or a judgment about what's

238
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:04,480
happening and we tend to think that there this commentary is integral to the

239
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,679
situation it turns out it isn't that this commentary is

240
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:17,679
extra and I would say that this extra bit that gets added on which is just a

241
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:24,679
habitual thing that human Minds like to do is often where this if we're going to

242
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:31,760
have like the inner critic show up it's going to be something that's going to have a role in our life it's this it's

243
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,200
this commentary about our experience and sometimes it's so familiar that we don't

244
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,440
even notice it we just start to think well that's just the natural way of

245
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,878
things that you know I'm just making up these things that if uh you notice like

246
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:55,480
oh I've been lost in thought for quite some time and then there might be really quick like dang it I I'm I'm just not a

247
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:03,440
very good meditator everybody else can meditate I can't and will they notice if I slip out early you know or whatever it

248
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:11,200
is right these types of things and there's we can start to see how so often this uh shows up in our life but we're

249
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:18,599
not noticing it because we're as I said kind of like conflating the commentary with the experience especially if it's

250
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:27,200
an uncomfortable experience or a new experience or something like this and it turns out of course the body

251
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:34,160
and the mind mind are talking to each other they're integrated they are not separate of course they aren't and so

252
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:41,440
there's this way in which the aversion the the anger the maybe even the hatred

253
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,760
towards some uncomfortable experience like actually ends up turning

254
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:52,480
up the volume of the uncomfortableness of that

255
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:00,920
experience so our relationship to what's happening really has a big role in our

256
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,720
life and our actual experiences so our inner life our psychology about how we

257
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,560
think about ourselves how we think about others but also it impacts the magnitude

258
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:19,000
of our experiences right the physiologist and

259
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,119
neurologist will point to the same thing about how experiences especially like

260
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,800
bodily experiences or uncomfortable experiences they have uh more than one component you

261
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,839
know they're a complex of both what's happening in the mind the story that the

262
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:42,960
mind is making whether it's pushing against it or whether it's pulling towards it wants more of that experience

263
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:51,920
want more or less or maybe it's just feeling confused and just keeps on like uh just kick getting off of that

264
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:59,000
experience that relationship we have to experience uh has an impact

265
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,079
as I said to kind of like uh can increase the volume but it there's a way

266
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,720
that um the impact is also it takes us away

267
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:15,680
it kind of like dilutes the actual lived experience instead we're having a

268
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:22,240
relationship with our thoughts about the experience so we're like two decrees

269
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,680
separated from what's actually happening and as I said this takes a

270
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:36,079
little bit of a trust to think that it's actually worthwhile to be with our experiences because I I'll speak for

271
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:42,480
myself I certainly thought it was all about figuring things out like okay my life would just be

272
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:50,240
better if I could just figure it out and figuring it out happens here in the mind but it turns out that like always

273
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,720
like running towards the mind or getting lost in the mind or um privileging the

274
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:01,400
mental experiences it's a way that just we start more and

275
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,880
more to be disconnected from what's happening but mindfulness of the body

276
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:15,400
like really feeling the body feeling the experiences is a way that we can start to see how the mind likes to leave and

277
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:23,400
go and then we start to also notice like where it likes to go and we'll talk about that later in a few weeks

278
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,079
but so we that with talking a little bit about uh how there's experiences and

279
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:36,119
then there's our relationship to that experience and the relationship is often a mental

280
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:41,400
experience i' just like to open it up are there any comments about how that

281
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:47,079
meditation was either like being with the breath and then moving towards something

282
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:52,359
compelling and then coming back to the breath and then being with the breath moving towards something compelling and

283
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:58,160
then noticing what the mind is doing with it would anybody like to share like

284
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:05,160
how that was how that uh meditation was and you know what I'm sorry I don't have somebody to help me move

285
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,400
this thank you I don't have a manager

286
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:18,240
tonight oh can you turn there's a little button on the side to push

287
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:25,319
in it's really just fatigue and and immediately almost instantaneously

288
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:30,440
dreaming I just it's like actually staying alert as opposed

289
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:36,160
to uh so it's kind of that thing of like fighting the dreaming but then giving

290
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:41,680
into the dreaming but then realize I'm losing myself in the dream um and then kind of coming away for a little bit and

291
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,880
fing back into the dream so anyway yeah and is this a has this happened to you

292
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,319
like before other times when you meditate or is it different this time yeah sometimes particularly when I'm

293
00:39:53,319 --> 00:40:01,040
well tired yes it definitely do that the dreaming is is yeah sure it's not the

294
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:08,960
first time so I have a few things to say that uh one is uh we can have this uh be

295
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:17,000
the object of our mindfulness it can be fascinating to you know just notice the mind you know getting tired and getting

296
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,319
like where the uh the hypnogogic images you know kind of this wavy thing and

297
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:27,920
then you fall asleep and then you wake up like oh yeah oh wait I'm supposed to be meditating but just to kind of like

298
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,920
bring mindfulness and sometimes that that investigation of the like heading

299
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:40,079
towards dream and then maybe you get lost in dream and then maybe there's coming out sometimes that investigation

300
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:46,000
can bring up the energy just a little bit so I'll just offer that another

301
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,800
thing is to uh pay attention to the posture like sometimes we have to just sit up a little bit straighter when

302
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:59,040
we're tired like putting a little bit more energy in that and then uh another one can be um

303
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:06,160
instead of just like the breath or a compelling sensation to give the Mind something to do that requires a little

304
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,560
bit more energy so sometimes it can be doing something like

305
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:17,079
um like maybe spending uh Sensations uh

306
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:23,000
the I'm trying to think about um the hands like how the hands

307
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,680
what the hands are touching and then pressure against the body probably like on the

308
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:35,440
buttocks and then maybe like the feet uh on the ground and then maybe uh the eyes

309
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:44,280
so if we go from the top to the bottom it's like around the eyes for maybe one second hands for one second pressure

310
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:51,720
against the buttocks for one second and then the feet for one second and just this kind of relaxed way going stepwise

311
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:57,480
through these different uh experiences can is just enough enough

312
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:04,200
energy it keeps the Mind alert but also has the same kind of calming and settling experience so that's an

313
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:10,200
alternative something to do and then maybe the last thing I'll

314
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:16,480
say is one can open their eyes too maybe that goes without say this and maybe you

315
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,720
knew all those things but I just offer them in case it's helpful anybody else have a comment or

316
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:31,240
anything they'd like to say I feel like I want to apologize if I've said some of these things um last week as it happened

317
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:38,480
I taught mindfulness just like intro intro in a number of different situations and it quite a few times last

318
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,800
few weeks just happened and I can't and I'm having a hard time keeping straight now did I say that to this group or that

319
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:52,960
group so apologies if you've heard a lot of this before anybody else have a comment when

320
00:42:52,960 --> 00:43:01,559
how was it when I said well what are is there the thoughts about the compelling experience did anybody notice

321
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:19,200
that okay so maybe I'll move on a little bit

322
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:26,760
so this idea about uh the commentary is also you know some uh I

323
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:33,800
know recently there's been this idea of the growth mindset that is this idea of

324
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:41,559
um things are possible and you know one can grow and learn and as opposed

325
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:46,760
to I I forget now what that not growth mindset is but you know they just feel

326
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:52,680
like nope this is the way I am and this is the way I'm going to be for the rest of my life and kind of like this uh

327
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:59,240
certain stubbornness in terms of uh like not I'm saying stubbornness but it maybe

328
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:04,319
that's not the right word but this feeling like we have these beliefs about like nope this is just the way I am or

329
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:10,079
and that's just the way things are and this idea of a growth mindset

330
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,559
which turns out to have so beneficial in our lives kind of it uh Keeps Us engaged

331
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:21,319
with our lives this idea like oh yeah things can be different I can learn new

332
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:27,800
things this growth mindset also shows up in this relationship that we have to

333
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:34,880
uh our experience this commentary uh one way that I like to

334
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,200
think about it is um yesterday I uh visited my mother my

335
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:48,480
mom and uh we were watching some of the Olympic trials uh I love to do this sort of as

336
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,920
my mom and uh so we were watching these like these amazing uh women uh

337
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:00,599
gymnasts and I noticed uh like getting like you know really involved with what

338
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:07,960
was happening and like feeling emotions you know when a gymnast did what they were expected to or it didn't you know

339
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:16,319
was like wow it was like so thrilling and I was kind of like feeling in like well why why is there this uh all this

340
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:24,559
emotion because if you think about it these are just amazing athletes doing amazing things but part of it was the

341
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:31,480
commentary right with the commentators are saying they're getting all excited with their energy and okay if she makes

342
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:38,079
it now she'll be able to get to this but will she do it you know there's this kind of a thinking and then I just

343
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,880
notice like oh I have to pay attention so in the same way are we have this

344
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:50,000
internal commentator that's happening and it's uh influencing our experience

345
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,240
we may not even notice it but it's sometimes obvious you know if we one

346
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:02,359
were to like turn off the whatever some athletic event or something like that and uh turn off the commentators right

347
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:09,200
all of a sudden that event is really different and so that's just for

348
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,440
something to think about the role that uh this that this

349
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:21,599
uh recognizing what the commentator is doing or you know

350
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:28,640
uh some of you may know this movie Jaws right and it has that music

351
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:36,760
like right it's the same type of thing right just like setting a tone or something just with a this people who do

352
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:42,520
movies and stuff like this know that so there's also like this um

353
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:48,079
attitude that having a certain flavor of this commentary to our bodily

354
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:53,839
experiences not only does it take it away from the experience but colors it

355
00:46:53,839 --> 00:47:00,000
maybe it makes it a a certain way that maybe it's helpful and maybe it's

356
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,800
not helpful and that we would have talked about this and maybe some of you are

357
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:13,160
familiar with this simile the simile of the two arrows so the Buddha asks uh the

358
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:19,079
people who are listening to him like is it painful to be shot with an arrow like

359
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:26,359
this is not a trick question yes it is painful and then he asks is it more

360
00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:34,160
painful to be shot by a second Arrow like yes it's even two arrows is

361
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:41,000
worse than one arrow and so the Buddha is pointed out like the first arrow is what life brings

362
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:48,160
us these I mean difficult things happen in our lives it's like that's just the Human Experience there's no denying this

363
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:55,319
even doesn't matter how much we wish it were be otherwise the truth is hard things happen painful things happen the

364
00:47:55,319 --> 00:48:03,800
second arrow is kind of like you know the one that we pick up and stab ourselves with and that often is the

365
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:09,920
commentary that's speeding us up comparing ourselves to others because

366
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,359
even if we are comparing and we think that we're so much better than everybody else then we have to make sure that they

367
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:22,760
see how much we're better and make sure that they don't see how we sometimes aren't better and we have to protect and

368
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,880
show off and it's exhausting trying to do that and if we feel like we aren't

369
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:34,920
better then H that's a terrible feeling too and if we feel like we're the same

370
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:41,359
then we always have to be comparing well I think I'm a same but are they are they getting ahead or oh am I getting ahead

371
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:46,480
you there's this way in which just comparing it doesn't matter what the

372
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,680
result of the comparing is comparing is extra and not helpful and

373
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:59,359
it turns out to always be painful and uncomfortable the painful and uncomfortable may be subtle at first we

374
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:05,040
might like oh look at me I'm the best but then then we always have to be

375
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:13,799
looking the best and we have to make sure that people don't see us so there's this way in which the commentary adds so

376
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:20,559
much to our experience that we're not noticing often and so mindfulness of the

377
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:28,240
body is a way that we can just be with whatever the experience is

378
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:35,040
is and then I'll talk more explicitly about like compelling experiences very

379
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:41,440
often like compelling bodily experiences especially in meditation there can be discomfort in the

380
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:48,520
body the knee can hurt the back can hurt you know what whatever it might

381
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:54,280
be and so there's a way in which as I've been saying we

382
00:49:54,280 --> 00:50:00,359
can notice it's often the commentary is the loudest

383
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:08,359
with the most uh uncomfortable experiences and so is there a way that

384
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:15,160
we can soften the commentary around really uncomfortable

385
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:21,640
things just notice like oh yeah that's a lot of anger for some people they feel

386
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:26,720
like there's something wrong if they're uncomfortable and they want to blame

387
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,680
blame the institutions blame other people blame themselves it doesn't matter they just want to blame kind of

388
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:38,599
like deflect you know any responsibility for the uncomfortable situation CU they feel like they're

389
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:46,520
failing in some kind of way or maybe there's this kind of like hatred towards uh uncomfortable things

390
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:54,280
like dang it go away when are you going to go away and this feeling like it's going to be like this forever and I'm

391
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,640
going to never be free from this

392
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:09,599
so this way that we can be with difficult experiences uncomfortable bodily

393
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:18,520
experiences is to one way is to notice the story that we have around it but

394
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:24,839
also to notice is there a way that we can be

395
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:29,599
with it in a way that might to

396
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:35,400
expand our capacity like yes this is

397
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:41,520
uncomfortable yes this is not what I want to be happening and yes this is

398
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:47,680
actually what is happening right now this moment it feels

399
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:55,079
like this and if we can do this like turning towards the uncomfortable

400
00:51:55,079 --> 00:52:01,559
experience that move movement from oh make it go away and um trying to like

401
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:06,760
separate ourselves from what's actually happening but instead to turn

402
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:12,359
towards that's a shift in our relationship and that shift in our

403
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:19,760
relationship to what's happening starts to create the conditions in which something else can

404
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,960
unfold that it can be that maybe there's if uh if you have some meditation

405
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:32,799
practice maybe you've already experienced this that something is really uncomfortable maybe you could start with something that an

406
00:52:32,799 --> 00:52:38,799
itch I it's like oh my gosh I have to scratch I have to scratch this on my face I'm not going to scratch I'm not

407
00:52:38,799 --> 00:52:44,640
going to scratch oh I need to scratch and then if you just uh be with this The Itchy itchiness itchiness and then maybe

408
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,079
it kind of like it comes up and then it just

409
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:57,359
resolves it turns out so much of our life experiences like this

410
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:04,760
but we don't notice we think it's like persistent and partly the way is because our relationship to what's happening

411
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:10,000
except we're pushing it or pulling and there's this way the act of pushing and

412
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,640
pulling hating blaming holding on to kind perpetuates

413
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:23,520
it fuels it but if we can allow it to be

414
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:30,760
there and it can just run its natural course and its natural course will not

415
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:38,359
be super the most extreme and it won't be the longest and again this takes some trust

416
00:53:38,359 --> 00:53:45,200
and I would say that trust comes from experience maybe this willingness to like I think I'll try this for a little

417
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:53,079
bit I'm not asking you to believe things or you know something like this but en encourage to just investigate is this

418
00:53:53,079 --> 00:54:01,480
true is this true can I like soften my relationship kind of like dampen the

419
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:06,960
anger that I'm having and one way that we can do that

420
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:12,960
dampen the anger cool the hatred towards like particularly uh I'm pointing to my

421
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:19,440
knee uh cuz my knee is a little uncomfortable to the uh uncomfortable

422
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,880
experiences is to actually feel either the uncomfortable

423
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:32,599
experiences itself or the anger the hatred and this is what we'll

424
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:40,079
talk about next week it's really hard to do that but just give you a preview

425
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:45,680
that our emotions have you know a bodily

426
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,799
experience and a mental experience the bodily experience is

427
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:58,319
moving so much slower right the mental experience is slippery and going anywhere and everywhere

428
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:06,640
so we could tune into either the pain the uncomfortable experience or

429
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:12,680
we can tune into the bodily experience of anger or whatever aversion whatever

430
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:19,920
it might be and that disrupts some of the momentum in the

431
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:27,039
mind does anybody have any comments or questions yes can can can we bring the

432
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:31,559
microphone back there thank

433
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:40,359
you um thank you for that you kind of mirrored what I'm

434
00:55:40,359 --> 00:55:46,440
learning uh through coming here on Sundays and I was telling my friend I

435
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,720
had to do a oral presentation yesterday I do not

436
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:57,400
like can you move that mic just a little bit closer there I'm meditating here is

437
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:05,920
it on it's not on oh maybe it's not on there we go there we go um so since I've

438
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:11,200
been meditating here on Sundays and being with you last week I'm doing

439
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:17,079
exactly what you said and I named it today being UNC being

440
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:23,760
comfortable with wait being comfortable with the uncomfortableness yes and I

441
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:31,640
learned yesterday by doing that you're fine and you gain more confidence

442
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:37,559
because you overcame sweating now the anxiety the all the uncomfortable

443
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:46,000
feelings are still there and you're bringing it you're bringing yourself and it's absolutely beautiful yeah so thank

444
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,760
you so much and thank you to Insight Meditation for helping me that thank you

445
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:58,359
yeah that's it exactly so the same experience is there but some of the problem kind of drains out it's less of

446
00:56:58,359 --> 00:57:04,200
a problem it's just it's what's being experienced yeah less reactivity less

447
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:11,559
reactivity and just presence and more humanness right because I'm showing up

448
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:16,799
with the anxiety and uncomfortableness and it's so human it's

449
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:22,960
so human it's so human and thank you for mirroring that yeah you're

450
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,720
welcome and maybe I'll build on what you said that it's so human because it connects us with other humans too we

451
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:36,640
notice like oh yeah this is other people maybe they are having these experiences too we can maybe notice that they are

452
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:42,880
don't want to be uncomfortable and see how they react or something like that so yeah and it's Brave to speak with your

453
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:49,039
voice quivering or whatever it is cuz you showed up yeah

454
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:54,920
yeah thank you thank you that's beautiful thank you anybody else have a comment or

455
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,119
something they'd like to say

456
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,920
um can be heard is it is it is it I think I think we have

457
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:12,559
to how about now here we go okay um just extending on that a little bit

458
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:20,240
um in terms of being comfortable with discomfort um there's the other side and

459
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:27,000
I know you used to do yoga I remember and then you know and I was curious just in your historical

460
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,280
uh situation what made you move I don't know if you still do yoga

461
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:39,720
and I'm curious or you moved fully over to Vasa the reason I'm asking the context is I do yoga as well and there

462
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:46,440
you move the energy you know it's a different framework and it's got its own validity as well right so I'm wondering

463
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:53,520
how you hold those two if you do yoga still I don't know yeah I should say I do yoga but it's more to support my

464
00:58:53,520 --> 00:59:00,960
sitting practice wait is that true uh it's primarily but sometimes I use it

465
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:08,200
just to like move the body you know as exercise or something like that but that's the way that kind of I use it so

466
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:14,039
not so much like intentionally to I don't know I'm just like doing ASA

467
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:20,200
practice I would say not like all of yoga is does that make sense

468
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:27,200
yeah but what made you like switch over completely oh what made me switch over

469
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:40,480
um it's hard for me to remember exactly I think that

470
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:47,640
um it's funny that I don't remember what made me switch over I think they're both

471
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:52,839
beautiful practices in complimentary um that I don't I don't

472
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:57,960
know I don't I'm sorry I don't remember exactly what why that happened yeah yeah

473
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:04,520
I you know I batt because I got I got a z place I here so I got

474
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:12,400
back wondering like does evolve to a point where a path opens up and

475
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:18,079
where I see so I don't I don't think your microphone was on so you were saying that you've done you do a number

476
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:24,520
of different practices and you're asking does the path open up and and it becomes clear is that was

477
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:30,200
that what you're yeah you know evolve over time where eventually like okay oh no this is the way I should go that sort

478
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:39,000
of clears up I see I see curious yeah because I'm not mentally able to like fully commit to any practice you know

479
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:45,119
and each one has its benefits you know yeah yeah yeah maybe I'll say that uh

480
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:50,359
Retreat practice for me was a GameChanger it really made it was a big

481
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:56,280
difference like to spend days in silence meditating there just the heart and the mind open and settle in a way that I

482
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:02,039
didn't even know was possible and many of the meditation centers like have yoga rooms where

483
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:09,640
people are like go to practice yoga uh as a way to complement their sitting meditation but uh yeah I would say maybe

484
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:15,000
it was Retreat practice that was the having that

485
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:23,920
experience does anybody else have a comment or question

486
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:48,359
it's a little mundane but um mundane is good mundane is good yeah I I have I ate

487
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:53,799
dinner and I food stuck in my teeth and I just can't wait to go home and brush

488
01:01:53,799 --> 01:01:59,240
my teeth and like so I had that commentary really loud this entire night

489
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:06,240
was I can't wait to go home and brush my teeth and floss you know and it just to kind of calm it down and sit with the

490
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:12,039
discomfort of having you know food stuck in my teeth was just like you know

491
01:02:12,039 --> 01:02:18,480
that's what's my practice this evening and was it uh what was like the tone of

492
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,039
this idea like oh I want to go I I added that up I don't know if you did but is it like okay soon as I'm done here I'm

493
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:31,559
going to go home and brush my teeth like my gosh I can't wait to get home and yeah yeah I was like there's a lot of tension within me and

494
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:36,640
um I yeah it wasn't a very calm okay well this will be over soon and then

495
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:42,440
we'll calmly go home and you know brush our teeth and no it's like I'm like kind

496
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:49,200
of restless in a way yeah mhm and do you have a sense of like if you this kind of

497
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:57,400
like wish to like want to go home and brush your teeth how did that feel in the body that wish to go go home what

498
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:03,920
was that experience like the wish to go home

499
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:10,599
was I don't know I I guess the most I can comment on that is just like I felt

500
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:16,920
like getting up like urge to get up and yeah not necessarily leave I think I had

501
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:23,480
enough like you know I guess um self-possession to kind

502
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:30,559
of like still sit down but you know that did feel a little bit of a wanting to just get up and just you know let's

503
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:36,079
maybe there's something in the bathroom there you know in the in the meditation

504
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:43,760
Hall so yeah excellent I love it I love that when I asked you this question you knew and so this turns you know earlier

505
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:49,839
I said that we could just you know notice anything and so if what's happening it's like I can't wait to get

506
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:54,960
out of here we can just notice that and often this kind of restlessness does

507
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,279
show up as uh in our arms or in our legs and there's a sense of like I want to I want

508
01:04:00,279 --> 01:04:07,079
to move and we can feel it in the body it's fantastic that when I asked you you had that sense tuned into that thank you

509
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:13,880
thank you anybody else have a comment or

510
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:21,559
question sure yeah can we can we bring the microphone over

511
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:31,599
here when the green with the green button is on it's working it's working there you go well this ISS a little bit

512
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:37,359
off topic but I too watch the Olympic trials

513
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:45,400
fabulous those girls they're just they're just amazing anyway fabulous but I was watching them and you they were

514
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:50,640
totally concentrating what on what they were doing they didn't care about the commentary that was going on I don't

515
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:56,680
even know if they could hear the commentary but they were just really concentrating on just

516
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:04,400
doing that bar routine or that you know doing it correctly and I love that yeah

517
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:10,400
they didn't hear they they couldn't have heard the commentary maybe that was for us as Spectators I mean as television

518
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:17,559
Watchers I don't know but but then they just they didn't I

519
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:23,279
don't know it just stuck Accord with yeah you know and I would say this is

520
01:05:23,279 --> 01:05:29,760
partly why we like to watch athletic or dance or performance is because we can

521
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:35,079
tell when somebody is really like in the zone so to speak right and there's

522
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:42,599
something about watching other humans do that that uh I don't know is Pleasant or

523
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:49,400
is uh I I don't know what it is exactly but I think what you're you're pointing to is something that's like integral to

524
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:54,440
be a worldclass athlete I would say and and also part of what makes it un

525
01:05:54,440 --> 01:06:00,640
enjoyable to watch and so there's this do you did you have

526
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:08,599
a question about this or I was okay yeah okay go ahead

527
01:06:08,599 --> 01:06:15,200
we can we'll put the little blue can you put that like blue thing back on top of that there we go yep there we

528
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:23,279
go I just had a um something I noticed which I don't know if it's significant or not but um I noticed I speaking in

529
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:28,400
the plural sometimes when I had my my commentary like let's get back to our

530
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:35,799
breath as almost there two different entities and I just wasn't sure if that's common or significant any way as

531
01:06:35,799 --> 01:06:41,559
opposed to being somehow integrated well I'll just ask you so was

532
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:48,760
plural was there a sense of more than one person or sometimes there's kind of like the Royal we right like you know uh

533
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:57,519
an individual will use the plural as a more kind like a formal or elevated way

534
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:03,079
speech I'm I'm not really sure actually something I noticed and it

535
01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:08,559
wasn't yeah yeah and was it uh what was the tone was it like uh come on

536
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:15,119
sweetheart let's get back to our breath I was like get back to the breath or more not quite the whipping but in that

537
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:21,640
direction yeah yeah so it's just I you know I

538
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:27,119
um I don't know if I've had this this plural thing but you know all of us are

539
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:34,440
so different kind of like how our minds are I certainly wouldn't be concerned about it or um or worried about it or

540
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:41,680
something like that so yeah just have some curiosity about

541
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:48,920
it okay so next week we'll talk about emotions and like you know how to bring

542
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:55,720
up mindfulness to them and I mean they're an integral important part of the human experience but there's also

543
01:07:55,720 --> 01:08:01,079
something that can kind of like hijack us and we feel like at the mercy of them

544
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:06,119
so next week we'll talk about how can we bring some stability to our emotional

545
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:11,200
life while also honoring and respecting our emotions so we don't want to repress them we don't want to pretend that

546
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:16,960
they're not there but how can we experience them without getting overwhelmed by

547
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:22,040
them so thank you all for coming and I'll see you next week and if you'd like

548
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:29,319
you're welcome to come up here and ask me some questions thank you thank you
