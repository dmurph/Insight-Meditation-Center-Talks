1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:07,680
okay got it so formally hello and welcome

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:15,040
to happy hour so nice at the beginning with our informal well uh start to welcome ourselves and

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,600
each other to the space it always warms my heart when folks say hi and type it in chats

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:30,160
along with the weather report in different places in the world you are so so for today's practice

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,960
for today's practice i'd like to invite us to explore

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,000
meta in the form of

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,120
radiating meta there are many different ways to practice cultivating goodness

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,160
cultivating care cultivating um friendliness

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,760
cultivating loving kindness for ourselves and others and there are many phrases

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,680
that we use as skillful means and yet sometimes phrases

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:13,840
can be helpful and sometimes they may not be and it's nice to have facility with either using phrases may i

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,280
be well may i be happy may i be safe etc whatever phrases you use the simple ones

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,560
or the traditional form or

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:33,840
just sitting in the state sitting in the feeling of metta um and radiating so

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,680
and sometimes what happens for many practitioners is that phrases

16
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,960
are used as support at the beginning to prime the heart

17
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,119
and it could happen sometimes during some sits or some retreats

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,960
that phrases then seem heavy and then the phrases naturally drop away and one

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,959
just wants to sit with the feeling of meta feeling of friendliness feeling of kindness

20
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,879
so there is no one size fits all is what i'm trying to communicate here

21
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,239
some people love phrases it helps them stay grounded stay with

22
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:27,680
the feeling some people don't like phrases they seem like distractions some people like them and then they drop

23
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,680
away they use them to prime the heart so

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,440
so so the invitation today um

25
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,840
maybe what we'll do is maybe we'll start by as always we will start

26
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,480
with um [Music] settling into the breath with the body

27
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,040
with awareness of body and breath just to settle and arrive and

28
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,599
this being friday for those who are joining live perhaps after a long week for you of

29
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,959
activity so i'll include a lot of silence

30
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,360
that's beginning for us to settle and then maybe we'll conjure up some of

31
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,440
the phrases just for a little while to prime the heart and then we'll drop them see what happens if you drop them

32
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:36,799
and just sit with the with the feeling of friendliness radiating radiating friendliness ah

33
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:43,360
radiating friendliness goodwill even if it feels especially if it feels

34
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,720
like work it's not yours it's not yours to generate imagine that it's just it's

35
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,920
there there's this there is this sun shining in your heart it's above and beyond you

36
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:05,519
it's something bigger than you the sense of good will friendliness that is just there

37
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,840
so i think that's enough for setting the frame let's practice

38
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:20,479
together so invite you to land

39
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,080
land in your body

40
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,840
land with your breath with your in-breath

41
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:57,840
and just as importantly with the entirety of your out breath cleansing releasing

42
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,520
breeding yourself at your own door

43
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:24,240
at the door of your awareness ah as if you're coming home after a long

44
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,160
trip you're tired it's been a long week perhaps

45
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:38,080
hello dear hello dear welcome welcome home welcome

46
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:45,919
home to your own body especially if you've spent time

47
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:55,280
away from your body worrying thinking in your head welcome yourself

48
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:07,199
ah oh it's nice to be back in this body

49
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:14,000
it's a turtle back cozily in its shell

50
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,840
ah this home this body

51
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:29,919
breathing the body greeting yourself in the body from the inside

52
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:49,840
with each breath

53
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,080
maybe dropping in hello hello dear hello your name hi

54
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:17,840
welcome home with each breath

55
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,560
and if thoughts plans worries from the past or the future arise

56
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,000
in this moment

57
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,720
giving your heart to being present here with the body

58
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:12,080
and asking the thought to come back later thank you for visiting please come back

59
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,479
later i'll wait for you now i'm giving my heart

60
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,080
to itself in the simplicity

61
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:32,000
of just sitting and being breathed at my home

62
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:55,839
in my home inside my home my body

63
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,160
having arrived home after a long trip as if it's after a long trip

64
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:52,639
ah blending landing in the body

65
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,839
with the breaths

66
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:08,320
putting down putting down whatever is not needed in this moment whatever is extra

67
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:22,560
if worrying is arising it's extra self-judgment

68
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:35,839
definitely extra comparing yourself it's extra

69
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,959
being simple simply breathing

70
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,839
as best as you're able to showing up

71
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:17,839
in this moment in this body

72
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,560
and dropping in the question in this moment as if you were dropping a pebble

73
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:10,399
into a lake letting it reverberate dropping the question

74
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,839
into your body not answering it from your head dropping

75
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,440
it in why am i here

76
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,839

knowing that any goodness you wish for yourself

93
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:43,840
will impact others

94
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,960
letting the wholesomeness the goodness continue to shine

95
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,639
as if there is a sun as if there is

96
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:22,559
a bright sun [Music] shining in the middle of your chest

97
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:29,520
the proverbial heart center it's shining it's this goodness it's this wish

98
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,759
this wish fulfilling jewel

99
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,360
shining whispering into the world

100
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:53,840
shining its light into the world more goodness happiness ease

101
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,039
love peace

102
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:21,840
service kindness

103
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:34,159
noticing that the rays of the sun touch you warm you up first

104
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,600
bring you ease and peace goodness

105
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:48,240
ah they shine upon you first

106
00:20:48,240 --> 00:21:03,840
and they shine outward unto the world

107
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:19,760
maybe it's a part of this message of goodness friendliness

108
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,720
happiness love and care

109
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:38,960
maybe for a moment the whisper becomes more audible

110
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:46,559
may all beings may all beings everywhere

111
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:52,720
including myself may all beings everywhere including this being

112
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,840
be safe from inner and outer harm

113
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:13,919
letting this light the sun radiate ah this message this whisper

114
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:21,600
this light this wish of safety knowing the world isn't

115
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,520
safe always we know that and yet it's a wish it's an intention

116
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:41,840
it's a good will that we share freely really

117
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,799
and maybe the second phrase of menta becomes audible now

118
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:56,159
may all beings everywhere including this being that is me

119
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:02,000
may all beings everywhere be happy joyous

120
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:11,120
filled with happiness may their hearts sing with joy with gladness with contentment

121
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,480
letting your inner goodness inner sun shine

122
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:37,840
brightly resting with its goodness

123
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,840
the third metaphase may all beings everywhere

124
00:23:52,240 --> 00:24:00,480
including me myself my all beings

125
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:08,799
enjoy physical well-being made their bodies may my body

126
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,639
be healthy and strong

127
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,840
again knowing that it may not always be possible

128
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:28,720
you may not be fully healthy right now but it's okay sharing this as an intention as a wish

129
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,080
it's the generosity of your heart as an inclination

130
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:46,000
may all beings have this goodness including me all of us all of us beings

131
00:24:46,000 --> 00:25:01,840
on this planet and beyond

132
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:17,120
feeling in your bones ah the goodness the generosity of this

133
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:29,840
wish spread far and wide

134
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:42,480
and maybe now the fourth metaphrase the whisper of it it's been shining

135
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,559
becomes audible in your mind in your heart

136
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:57,520
more so may all may all beings everywhere

137
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,320
may all beings everywhere including myself

138
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,840
have ease

139
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:25,840
may their lives unfold with ease may i meet this moment with ease

140
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:10,320
you're welcome to consider hearing the whisper of the phrases or whatever version of them you like

141
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,240
or let the shining of your inner goodness inner wish

142
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:27,600
for happiness health safety love ease to radiate through the world

143
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:35,279
shared with all beings in silence

144
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:49,840
you decide what's best for you

145
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:28,840
whatever you choose let it be easeful let your body relax resting in the

146
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:45,840
goodness of matter

147
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:58,880
if at any point the light might feel dim [Music]

148
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,880
reconnect with your wish with your intention

149
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,440
why are you here why are you practicing

150
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,679
what is your highest intention

151
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:33,840
as a human in your life

152
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,320
reconnect reconnect with the beauty with the sacredness

153
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,840
of the sun shining within you

154
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,880
[Music]

155
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:28,960
and for the last moments of this practice

156
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:40,399
feeling your body embodied sitting a little more upright perhaps

157
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,078
ah breathing in and out

158
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,398
the goodness of your intentions more fully letting

159
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,839
them shine into the world unto yourself unto their fellow

160
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:06,160
practitioners in the zoom room

161
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:16,960
on youtube across time and space

162
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,040
and if any judgments have arisen no i failed i was distracted

163
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:29,599
not good enough let this shine let the sun of your goodness shine on that too with

164
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,519
kindness with friendliness

165
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,680
shining on yourself thanking yourself thank you thank you dear

166
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:50,960
for showing up as best as you were able to in this moment for aligning

167
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:59,599
your actions with your intentions showing up

168
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,079
thank you

169
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,400
may the goodness may your collective goodness

170
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,880
expressed shared

171
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:23,680
cultivated further more deeply via cause and condition

172
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:31,599
for awakening full freedom of all beings everywhere

173
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:40,160
including ourselves may all beings be happy may all beings

174
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:55,838
be free

175
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:09,838
thank you thank you for your practice

176
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:24,640
so this practice we explored at the beginning coming home to our bodies embodiment

177
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:31,440
welcoming ourselves home and then we connected with our intention

178
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:39,760
with our highest intention and through that allowing this intention

179
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:47,520
whatever it might be for goodness or happiness for peace for love for joy for health this

180
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:54,320
goodness allowing you to to permeate through the world

181
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:01,520
allowing it to permeate and to actually see that this

182
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:08,240
the inner goodness this inner wish is not so separate perhaps from meta

183
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:15,040
this wish of goodness for the world because when we allow our most beautiful intentions

184
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,200
our aspirations to shine in the world they serve the world it's as if we're wishing the world well

185
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:27,200
everyone will safety and happiness health and ease so

186
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:33,040
seeing that those are not too far away and then dropping them if we wanted to

187
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:38,960
dropping the phrases and being with the primating of meta so

188
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,119
a lot of different things we explored and i wonder

189
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:52,000
what you noticed what was a lie for you in this practice would love to hear your reflections your

190
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,119
insights in service of awakening both for

191
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:04,480
yourself to be held witness and also in service of community you can raise your zoom hand because

192
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,720
your physical hand i may not see and or type in chat i've just changed

193
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,160
the settings if you type them publicly i'll say your name as i read out the chat if it's just

194
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,960
to me i will read the reflection but not your name so

195
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,560
so why did you discover sharing for the benefit of all beings

196
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:43,838
dear sangha was there a part which particularly spoke to you or was newt for you

197
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:57,838
or a part that didn't work for you and you have questions about how do i work with this

198
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,839
or maybe how you feel now compared to the beginning when you arrived

199
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:14,800
at happy hour i can tell you i feel a lot more calm and rested than i felt i was pretty tired when i

200
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,920
arrived it had been a long day a long week i'm i'm rested now i feel

201
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,400
happier yay sarah please

202
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:34,240
i really liked it when you um were saying uh coming up being at home

203
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:40,160
being in your home in your body in your home and it it brought tears to my eyes

204
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,640
because sometimes i feel alone and and i

205
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:54,160
and and that helped me feel like i'm not alone because i have i have this body i have a place to be

206
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:01,520
so i really liked that thank you sarah beautiful i am so

207
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:10,560
touched i moved my body's resonating with what you said happy making yay home in our bodies

208
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:17,200
yeah nice bill says the idea of connecting with highest intention

209
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:26,480
appeals to me but i frequently wish for a change now need to be patient nice

210
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:34,319
nice thank you yes and one thing to say about that is yes need for patience the practice of

211
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:41,440
patience and the highest intention is an aspiration it's

212
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,720
something that we keep waking up to waking up every day working towards little by little

213
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:52,720
by little so yes patience forest says when you had us drop in the question at

214
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,839
first i was squeezing trying to figure out the answer but then i realized

215
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:04,880
it was very pleasant to treat the question itself as my meditation object could you say more about how to use

216
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,560
questions oh lovely i love that question forest that's fantastic

217
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,079
um so so that the the way that you actually use the question

218
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,520
um what is my highest intention is that how you used it first i i wonder

219
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,720
uh if you would say a little more just so that i'm a little more

220
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:33,520
more clear about how you used it as a as an object yeah it was when you had us ask what our

221
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:39,119
highest intention was which i know i've also been doing since gil fond still introduced that

222
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:46,240
and um then i switched to just keeping that question as my object of

223
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,240
focus but not thinking about it just like keeping the question continuously as my object of focus which was interesting i

224
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,280
don't know if that was how you're supposed you know how you can work with it

225
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:05,839
yeah yeah so so the question the question actually being what is my highest intention in that way ah beautiful

226
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:10,880
i i love that that's a beautiful way to use the inquiry it's kind of like

227
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:17,599
dropping it in so so you can use it that way and sometimes i've used another way to

228
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,839
work with this is to to um to repeat it in tension to repeat it multiple times and repeating

229
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:30,400
putting dropping it once see what arises maybe nothing arises dropping it again and see what arises

230
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,720
sometimes different things arise as you drop it drop it in so you know you might drop it in an

231
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:44,319
intention can come up oh i want to be happy i'm here because i'm tired i'm just exhausted okay that's great

232
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:50,720
okay oh because i want to serve or you know different layers can come up that's another way you can

233
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,400
work with dropping in the questions see what arises and sometimes just as you were saying nothing might

234
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:03,599
arise so so you work with this as a oh my highest intention it's it is sacred to actually be asking

235
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:10,960
this question what a beautiful question to be asking and that's how you ended up working with it lovely

236
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,680
thank you for that what a gift beautiful stephanie says oh same here sarah oh i

237
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:25,040
love that stephanie too that's great and i see claire's hand is up so um let's make it brief because

238
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:32,000
i realized 6 49. so um yes tell me what's up what's up claire yeah it was i had two

239
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,319
contradict totally contradictory experiences it was very funny when you talked about speaking versus

240
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,520
non-speaking i was originally trained uh to practice

241
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:50,240
by focusing on a thought or a visual anything and letting go of all my

242
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:56,720
thinking all together and just and that's the way i prefer so i thought i was going with what you were

243
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,960
saying and saying oh god yeah i'm gonna go back to what i know because it really works for me

244
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:09,440
and then you started to talk and you talked about the door and coming back home and it was so

245
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:16,720
helpful to me this doesn't make sense i just said to myself you know no talking but

246
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:24,560
because i'm i tend to be out of the world a lot i like to interact with people yeah and i forget to come back to myself

247
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,599
i love it i love it claire and this is what it's doing for me

248
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,640
great i love it i love it i hear it so it's like okay it's quiet silence yes that's what i

249
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,800
mean but oh wow this talking actually these guys the guidance is so helpful because i forget beautiful

250
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:46,480
thank you claire that's lovely it's heartwarming and kenneth i wonder would it be okay to come back

251
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:52,240
to you after the groups i see your hand is up yes okay great

252
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:58,480
because it's uh 6 50. i want to make sure we have time for the this is around the time we transition so

253
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:04,000
when we come back from the groups kenneth you're up so i would love to hear from you so the invitation

254
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:15,839
now is as we go into the small groups the invitation so the invitation is

255
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,079
no we a lot of times what comes up for practice is comparing mind we compare ourselves less than

256
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:30,079
greater than bigger than my son is bigger their intention is bigger what if we drop all that

257
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:35,599
my practice better theirs is better just dropping all that what if we just drop all that

258
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,599
so if you're just showing up just

259
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:48,960
so so that's the idea i want to invite us today a slightly different flavor

260
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:55,920
of of showing up for each other with each other of course with meta we start as always

261
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,839
with 15 seconds of of silent meta for one another for each other

262
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:07,599
uh but this sense of just you're showing up as if with beginner's eye as

263
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:14,640
a beginner's eyes as if you're a first-time practitioner you've just shown up you're you're being a martian

264
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:20,720
or your baby you've just shown up on this earth you're just ah here are other babies see what that

265
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,000
feels like okay all right let's let's try this out

266
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:34,559

268
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:48,400
kenneth is kenneth here i think kenneth had to leave so okay can't hear from kenneth but

269

270
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,760

271
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:09,119

274
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:28,319

275
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:33,440
