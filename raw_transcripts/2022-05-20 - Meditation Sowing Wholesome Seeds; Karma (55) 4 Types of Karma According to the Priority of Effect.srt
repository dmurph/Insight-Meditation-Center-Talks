as something to be afraid of something unknown magical weird strange

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,680

31
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,759
just here trusting trusting that

32
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,520

when the future moments whatever they hold future moments become present moment

38
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,919
trusting in this capacity to meet them too in the

39
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:17,319
same way building

40
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,080
sowing seeds of trust

41
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,599
through this moments of awareness

42
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:31,360

43
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,200

47
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,800
letting go tasting peace

48
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,560
in this moment here

49
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:20,640
so it's seeds are replanting in this moment in this moment right here

50
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,639
wake up what are you planting right now

51
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,360
becoming aware choosing to plant wholesome seeds

52
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,080
it's that simple

53
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:20,320
if you find the mind lost in thoughts or engaged in

54
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,520
thoughts emotions contracted in ways that are not helpful

55
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:36,240
become aware become kindly aware not resistantly

56
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,559
not grudgingly

57
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,720
but kindly aware

58
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,799
release release what's not profitable in this life

59
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,600
for you for others in this moment

60
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,799
it was a thought of ill will perhaps judgment towards yourself towards others

61
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,200
maybe let there be a thought of kindness

62
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:30,799
planting a seed of kindness intentionally with intention

63
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,039
kindness forgiveness generosity for yourself or others

64
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:46,639
for the world releasing releasing

65
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,960
giving

66
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:07,400
planting wholesome karma both in the way you become aware

67
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,960
not with aversion but with kindness

68
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,640
in the action of the mind

69
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,919
that then follows into peace into good will

70
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,120
into awareness presence here here

71
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:23,960
begin again and again and again if needed it's okay

72
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:07,120
and as we bring this sit so close together

73
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:17,440
let there be a moment of appreciation planting the seed

74
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:26,480
of gratitude appreciation for yourself for the sangha for the opportunity

75
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,799
to come together and to practice whatever arose or did not arise

76
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,919
in these 30 minutes

77
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,679
you have showed up you've done your best

78
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,880
let there be kindness

79
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,640
appreciation for the goodness that has been created

80
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,720
has been co-created with generosity offering

81
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:13,120
sharing that merit that goodness with all beings everywhere

82
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:19,919
all that we do our life is not

83
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:26,799
for us to keep any goodness of it it's an act of service it's an act of

84
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:32,320
goodness to be shared

85
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:41,039
others so offering this practice to this act of

86
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:47,760
goodness may be a support for all beings everywhere

87
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:55,200
and cultivating goodness kindness freedom for myself and all beings everywhere

88
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:02,120
may all beings be free including myself

89
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,919
thank you for your practice hello and

90
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,360
welcome friends so

91
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,919
so this week we have been exploring the teachings of karma together

92
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:49,360
and i'd like to share just a few minutes of review of what we've covered this week

93
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:56,559
so that if you feel inspired if you've missed any of the talks or if you feel inspired to go back

94
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,080
you can and also i'll add a few more teachings

95
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,799
today so so

96
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,279
karma not as a teaching of this magical

97
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,480
something that has been passed down from some previous life and whether i'm doing

98
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:26,399
well or poorly or others oh it's the fault of what they did in the past life ouch ouch very painful way to

99
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:32,080
to um contract around that teaching but actually to see it

100
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:39,679
as an empowerment as an empowering teaching of how our intentions actions here and now

101
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,120
can form can shape who we are who we become how we serve in

102
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,240
the next moment and the next moment and the next moment which is actually quite

103
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:58,080
concordant with what neuroscience nowadays tells us about how plastic how plastic our

104
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:05,440
brain we are we're so plastic in our actions the way we behave and act it changes it

105
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,559
it shifts the river of our thoughts our actions

106
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:18,080
and the way we who we become in the world so we talked about the three aspects

107
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:25,600
of karma karma's action there's the leading edge which is the intention there is the

108
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,360
action itself is the doing it's the doing which is the doing of the mind

109
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:38,080
thoughts are considered actions of the mind there's the doing in the mind actions of speech actions of the body

110
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,200
and then there's the trailing edge of the action what is left what is made uh

111
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,360
what is left these ossified karmic relics that we create and we leave in

112
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,360
our bodies minds would become and the image of a potter that's intending to

113
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,720
create a shaping forming and then leaves it leaves the creation in the cul in the

114
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,640
kiln and becomes ossified so in that way we create all these momentums all these

115
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:13,200
relics so we then talked about the next day we

116
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,560
talked about how wakefulness how actually changing

117
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,960
our karma in every moment intending to wake up and make another

118
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,000
choice is possible through mindfulness when you are mindful

119
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,118
not just on the cushion but in daily life so then the practice of karma

120
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,240
awareness and shifting your karma doesn't isn't just limited to sitting

121
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:47,839
silently on the cushion but it becomes a daily life practice daily life practice of awareness awareness each moment what

122
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:54,240
am i thinking oh sweetheart do you really want to be thinking about that do you really want to beat that dead

123
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:01,839
horse that you've been beating for 10 years and it's not really helping you're helping you or helping anyone so moments

124
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:07,280
of awareness with kindness darling please please let's let's try something

125
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:14,000
differently may you be well may i be well planting seeds of kindness

126
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:22,000
and then we talked about it's not so much the what the object in

127
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,560
awareness that arises but how we relate to it it's the way that we engage

128
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:37,119
that really shapes and forms the karma it's it's our engagement it's the our reaction or reactivity or or or the way

129
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:43,280
we interact with some so it's our engagement that emotional quality of our engagement the actions of the mind and

130
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,680
heart how we intend and engage that really shape and form and again concordant with neuroscience

131
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:58,160
in the ways that emotion when there is an emotion regarding an event an object in in the sensory

132
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,800
space it it actually it fixes it more in place in terms of a pattern

133
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:11,280
yesterday we talked about rebirth

134
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,119
reconsidering rebirth re-imagining rebirth um if rebirth were true it

135
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:24,160
wouldn't be uh again this magical thing perhaps or or this thing that we are uh powerless

136
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,520
against but in the way of gratitude as if we have an ancestor

137
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,960
at the same way we have physical ancestors we have this perhaps ancestor that has

138
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,079
sent us um some that sent us goodness and sent us

139
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:46,720
into the future and how can we how can we what we have received how can we make the best of this

140
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,000
karmic potentiality how can we make it pretty uh with with beautiful thoughts

141
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,720
beautiful wholesome seeds and pass it down and and with the teachings of

142
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:07,119
the self being made of causes and conditions it's it's really um the idea of rebirth

143
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:13,280
really becomes an understanding of gratitude and understanding of

144
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,400
appreciation and understanding of generosity how can we pass and how can

145
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,680
we make this karma as beautiful as shining as possible and pass it down to

146
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:31,480
this other human being who's going to have a different nationality and perhaps gender identity and color and

147
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:37,920
circumstances and different sets of neuroses and ah we want to give pass on

148
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,280
the best to this to this child to this quote-unquote child of ours so different

149
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:50,960
different way to perhaps if you wish to relate to that and what i wanted to bring in today in

150
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,839
the time that's limited left after this brief uh summary is um

151
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:05,040
is that there is a lot more detail there's a lot more of course in the teachings of about the teachings of

152
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,160
karma and um and in fact i pulled out that this book

153
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:16,640
by my my teacher um the workings of karma by venerable pox ida so you could

154
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:23,440
go let's see how many pages is this 370 something uh 400 you can read 400 pages

155
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,960
on karma the workings of karma and yet what is really really important

156
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:35,440
is how this moments really this moment's action

157
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,480
is conditioning the next and the next and the next with awareness really

158
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,560
that's practically that's what we need to engage with in our lives

159
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,599
but just to bring a little more detail here um there are many different types of

160
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,040
classifications in the um

161
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,800
in the teaching especially in the abidama in visudi maga in the higher teachings

162
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:10,240
there are many different types of classifications of types of karma i'm going to share just

163
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,760
one type of classification which i think is actually helpful uh for us the way to

164
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,960
relate to it so the cl this classification is

165
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,119
according to priority of effect and there are four different types

166
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,760
so one is the the heaviest the highest priority level is called weighty karma

167
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,680
or garuka karma and weighty karma can either be actually

168
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,800
good karma good weighty karma karma that has heavy weight but it's good and it's

169
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,000
good or or unwholesome karma and

170
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,359
for um on wholesome in in the teachings the the

171
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:01,599
weighty unwholesome karma is considered um killing one's parents and

172
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:10,000
and um um murder of of a fully enlightened being for example and and also a permanent uh

173
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,040
actually um a creation of schism in the saga is also

174
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,560
considered weighty sangha now to think about this actually in in

175
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:27,839
neuroscience terms there are some actions that have are so heavy are so heavy not just for ourselves but for

176
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:33,599
everyone else they have consequences so if you create a schism for example in a

177
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:40,960
community oh that has repercussions for yourself and for everybody else so we can see why that's number one in terms

178
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,240
of weighty karma and in terms of a weighty

179
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:52,160
wholesome karma their moments of awakening of course is is a wholesome

180
00:40:52,160 --> 00:41:00,000
way to karma moments of awakening freedom peace uh deep states of absorption etc

181
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,640
then number two is a proximate uh proximate karma

182
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:13,200
so proximate karma um the teachings actually teach talk about that in terms of the what do you remember the

183
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:20,480
immediately the moment before you die the proximate karma for the next rebirth but actually it's a lot more general so

184
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,760
proximate karma we can observe it and really see and in the neuroscience terms

185
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:32,160
if you've been uh say grumpy if you've been or you've been thinking let's say ill will thoughts

186
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:39,119
then there is proximate karma if the la if the previous moment you've been angry and upset the chances are that the next

187
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:46,160
moment you're going to be angry and upset right it's the proximate karma's the proximate moment the mind moment

188
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,280
mind moments the approximate karmics it's what really gives shapes to how you

189
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,960
show up how you act so interesting to observe these in your own actions

190
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,079
in your daily life the third one is habitual karma achina

191
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:09,119
karma the last one was asana karma so number three is habitual achina karma

192
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:16,160
um habitual karma again that makes sense too right what you do most habitually if

193
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,720
you say after you after you work maybe you just turn on the

194
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:29,839
television or watch netflix for hours and that's just habitually what you do well when you

195
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:36,480
finish working for example oh that's what habitually you have done you will do you will do

196
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:44,640
so habitual karma and then the last the last one is called reserve or cumulative karma and and this

197
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,240
kind of is kind of a catch-all uh category in in in this buddhist

198
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:56,000
categories um and it's basically because it literally means because done so all

199
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,960
the actions that were not included in the previous categories and these are so if if the weighty karma if the ones

200
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:09,520
that's really heavy and if the ones that's proximate and if the ones that's habitual if none of those actually form

201
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,839
or shape this moment's experience maybe something you've done in the past something that has been done

202
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:21,040
anyway but if none of these other ones have very strong impact then something

203
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:28,240
you have done in the past some tendency of the mind that is not immediate that is not necessarily habitual and it's not

204
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:34,319
heavy but but has been done in the past so it's something that you can think or something that you tend to do

205
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:41,200
that is what finds fruition so i i can i think of these uh

206
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:47,200
categorization as being helpful as to ways to study and really see our own

207
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,720
actions and how the way we think we act we intend in the world can shape the

208
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,839
next moment and all of these how they interact again there are many different

209
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:03,440
ways um classifications and just to say at the end that it is

210
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,920
said that at the night of his enlightenment the buddha um before he was

211
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:16,880
enlightened awakened his mind woke up and he saw the workings of karma the

212
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,079
both so and karma is deeply connected with dependent origination

213
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:28,960
with the laws of causality so these teachings are intertwined and he woke up

214
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:36,880
to seeing the workings of karma which are complicated and yet what all we need to know really

215
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,920
for us for our liberation for how we this being lives and

216
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,680
and serves and is happy or unhappy and causes happiness unhappiness

217
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,960
in the world for all beings present and future is

218
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,240
just awareness in this moment what are we doing what are we planting in this moment

219
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:04,240
