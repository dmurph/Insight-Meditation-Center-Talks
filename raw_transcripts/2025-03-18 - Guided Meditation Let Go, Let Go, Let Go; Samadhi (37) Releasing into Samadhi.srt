00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:09,080
hello and welcome and this week the idea is

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:15,080
to say less at the beginning of the meditation so we can have a longer

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,080
meditation so to assume a meditation

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,920
posture and [Music] to find a nice

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:34,680
balance on the sitting bones and your spine line a nice way in which maybe the spine

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,680
straightens a bit regardless of whether you're lying down or sitting

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,559
up maybe allowing the chest to be a little bit

8
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:53,640
broader and maybe more room in the belly for the belly to

9
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,000
relax and to gently close your

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:12,799
eyes and often in these beginning minutes of the meditation I emphasize

11
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,520
relaxing today I'd like to encourage not relaxing but

12
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,320
releasing releasing that's almost like allowing whatever tension or holding

13
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,119
there is whatever tightness attachments there

14
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:40,720
are to allow them what they want deep inside they want to be

15
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,759
released and that samade has a lot to do with releasing

16
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,920
thoroughly repeatedly just releasing anything the mind is holding on

17
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,719
to and releasing into

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,360
the very center of the meditation which have been emphasizing

19
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:15,080
is the experience of breathing the body's experience of

20
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,680
breathing wherever that is the easiest to

21
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,239
follow and imagine that the

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,840
breathing is like a river that's flowing

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,519
and your awareness is like a raft

24
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:46,440
canoe that stays right on the surface of the river but gets picked up and Carri it

25
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:54,319
along floating along so release yourself

26
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:01,560
into the body breathing Release Yourself In into the

27
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,640
current of breathing in and breathing

28
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:17,680
out some points during the exhale or the inhale it might the current might be

29
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,000
faster maybe in transition from breathing out to breathing in the

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,640
current has slowed considerably but but if float along be

31
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:38,480
carried along stay close stay intimate with the sensations the river

32
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,920
of sensations of breathing as if and if when the mind

33
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:51,720
wanders off when anything gets any preoccupations come

34
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,200
release release back into

35
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,599
breathing and the word release points to something a little bit different than Letting

36
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:09,040
Go Letting Go has a little bit more to do with something it's more with we

37
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:17,000
do it's fine to relax it's fine to let go but for entering into

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,880
submod there's also this allowing for the release maybe you do a little bit of it

39
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:33,000
but some of it is also just the the medit meditation releasing

40
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,240
itself following the

41
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,160
breath maybe following when it comes

42
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:56,840
on the pleasure The Joy sometimes even the the

43
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:06,440
thrill of being carried along by the current of the river the river of

44
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,759
breathing one breath at a

45
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
time

46
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,639

remember to release with a

52
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:34,399
quiet deep deeper sensitivity to whatever way you're

53
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,160
caught preoccupied

54
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:47,880
tense release and release

55
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:55,720
settle your awareness into the onward

56
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,120
leading experience of

57
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,320
breathing where awareness

58
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,279
rides the sensations of

59
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,480
breathing as the only

60
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,639
thing that is important during during these

61
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
minutes

staying with your breathing and remembering to release to

72
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,200
let go

73
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,280
and in deeper meditation

74
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,440
release comes with joy comes

75
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:21,679
with a delight or well-being comes with a

76
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:30,720
yes it's okay in these minutes of meditation

77
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,679
to take the chance take the risk of letting go of

78
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:45,159
everything and letting go into the stream of

79
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:55,600
breathing release whatever you're holding on to or

80
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,559
whatever is holding on to you let

81
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:12,399
go let go let go into the Simplicity of

82
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
breathing

83
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

84
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

85
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520

for

87
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

88
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

89
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

90
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

91
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

92
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for

93
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
for for

94
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:54,000
the deeper the Letting Go the deeper the

95
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,840
release the better we can meet the next

96
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,960
moment clearly

97
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,960
freshly and as we come to the end of this

98
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:20,720
sitting to let go and release

99
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:32,520
enough to be renewed in our vision and how we see see the

100
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:39,919
world see others for a few moments at least

101
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:47,919
without prejudice without bias without preferences just

102
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,760
see where what we see has been

103
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:02,518
released from the hold of our attachments and preferences

104
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,360
desires we give freedom to each

105
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:19,360
thing and may it be as we return to this our usual world of people and

106
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,000
activities may it be that we see with

107
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,360
wisdom how to release release

108
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:42,240
others from our attachments so we see them freshly

109
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:50,120
freely so that the way that we see others makes it easier for

110
00:28:50,120 --> 00:29:00,039
them to feel free peaceful safe and happy

111
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:08,399
may all beings be happy may all beings be

112
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:14,080
safe may all beings be

113
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,120
peaceful may all beings be

114
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:29,720
free and may the very way that we walk in the world support this possibility

115
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:41,259
[Music]

116
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:54,440
thank [Music]

117
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,039
you e

118
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,919
so welcome to this next talk on some

119
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:07,519
and um tadi is the Buddhist word for being deeply

120
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,519
immersed in the meditation deeply immersed in anything that we're

121
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,600
doing where that immersion there is no holding back

122
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:26,440
there's no resistance there's no self-consciousness in a kind of uh

123
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,519
attached way there's a giving ourselves

124
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,880
over to the meditation to the attention to

125
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:44,559
the present moment and a lot of that has to do with letting go and I think I mentioned some

126
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:51,120
time ago that one of the first instructions that I received uh about

127
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:57,440
going into suadi was in Thailand when first went there to practice and um I

128
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:04,679
met a monk who said that um he was a little bit dismissive I think of samadi

129
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:11,039
and he said that samadi just it just involves letting go just let go let go

130
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:19,039
let go and um but I don't think we need to be dismissive of it it's kind of

131
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:27,480
remarkable that if you place yourself in a nice meditative posture and then let go that this

132
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:35,960
natural process occurs that is a kind of a releasing a freeing a deepening a

133
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:44,519
sense of well-being that Wells up that almost as if it's almost as if the a natural state

134
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:51,919
of being immersed in activity brings Joy uh without there be any worldly reason

135
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,600
for that joy to be there except for the complete immersion in the activity that

136
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:04,200
we're doing with the meditation we're doing and so this deeper release into

137
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,440
the meditation um uh we're releasing a lot of things but one of the things we're

138
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,799
releasing is any strain or expectation around the meditation any pushing trying to make

139
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:23,080
something happen um uh any thinking anything that the the the thinking mind

140
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,320
is doing trying to do um in this kind of

141
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:35,440
the in the in this kind of um superficial way uh coarser way it all

142
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:42,120
gets let go let go let go and but don't just let go let go

143
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:51,279
into the object of meditation a release into the the the body breathing so that

144
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:58,639
you're really like the idea is you're you're finding a way to immerse yourself in it and that immersion is kind of also

145
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:04,360
then becomes the the totality where everything that we are is

146
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:10,398
Unified with it and um so then you know the analogy I gave yesterday was someone

147
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,599
in the edge of a maybe it's a hot day and there's a nice cool wonderfully cool

148
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:22,398
Lake person sits there being very hot and thinks about Lake thinks about going into an air conditioned room thinks

149
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:28,118
about getting a fan thinks about all kinds of things sitting there being hot

150
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:34,320
and um and the mind is just busy thinking planning wanting and while the lake is right

151
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,440
there all the person has to do is immerse themselves in the lake and

152
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:47,079
um and uh and then there's a immersive feeling of the water the coolness the

153
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:53,800
sensations of it it's clear that we're immersed in something that's wonderful now and all those thoughts planning

154
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,119
Thoughts by going someplace where it was cool follow way because they're clearly

155
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:06,440
not needed anymore and maybe for a little while there's no need to think of anything it's just so good to be

156
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,680
immersed in that cool refreshing pool of

157
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,760
water so we're sitting in the edge of a wonderful refreshing or if you prefer

158
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,079
the different metaphor of warm nurturing a pool of

159
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:33,000
somadi and uh don't think about it don't be involved in planning and wanting and expecting um release let go into

160
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,520
it and um and with and don't let go too

161
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:44,560
hard don't let go too quickly or too often because that itself then it's just

162
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:50,160
more of the same kind of attachment and trying to manipulate and make make

163
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,960
something happen uh in a just let go in a relaxed open way almost like you don't you're

164
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:04,240
not trying to make something happen because any holding any tension in and

165
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:11,160
of itself there's a desire there's a yearning there's a a momentum to let go

166
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:19,200
just like any ball that's put on a slope um will start rolling downhill we could

167
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:26,640
say the ball wants to that's what what wants to do the pull of gravity is its desire there's in the midst of any

168
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:33,160
clinging any holding any attachment to self or to outcome or to pleasure is a

169
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:40,359
kind of um holding the ball Against Gravity and if we release the ball it

170
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:48,160
will R downhill we will there an onward leading nature of going into the experience more

171
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:55,319
and more fully um entering the experience fully is the direction that our whole system

172
00:36:55,319 --> 00:37:02,000
is designed to do if we El go of everything else and there can be this a

173
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,720
surface kind of preoccupations and attachments and but as those get quieter

174
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:13,560
we can start feeling there's something a deeper movement a deeper desire deeper a

175
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:19,599
thing that wants to happen that is not really associated with our usual self

176
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,280
our usual desires it's more like a it's as if it's kind of a natural or deeper

177
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:33,160
or or um Freer kind of movement desire approach that places

178
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,560
us right there in the in the breathing

179
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:44,400
and um and so to think of the breathing breathing in and breathing out like a

180
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:51,200
river it's flowing and we place Awareness on the surface of that

181
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,079
River an awareness can maybe think of it as a raft or a canoe and we keep it that

182
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:03,640
close is floating on top and then the the bodus is carried by the current and

183
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:10,319
flows along the ups and downs the the twists and turns

184
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:18,680
of the river as it flows with the in breath and out breath all the different changing Sensations just right there and

185
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:24,200
to get really intimate um I find it useful to remember

186
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:33,440
that any Sensation that we experience the sensing of it is nondual with this

187
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,920
uh sensation or what I mean by that is that you cannot separate out as two different

188
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,280
things sensing in the moment and the sensations that are being sensed these

189
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:51,280
two occur together and uh that's there's an intimacy and a closeness we're sensing

190
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,520
as a little bit more what the Mind does maybe the nervous system does and

191
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:03,760
sensation is what what is being triggered by some event some some someplace but those things arise

192
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:12,040
together and that intimacy to be right there to awareness to sense and to feel for feeling to be abiding in that place

193
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:18,880
where sensing and Sensations Ur together to really stay with that with the breathing the sensations of breathing

194
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,839
wherever they might be and um and to

195
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:31,079
release and there's an art to Letting Go releasing

196
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:36,680
into uh the river of breathing that recognizes also that you're releasing

197
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:44,119
into whatever pleasure whatever Joy whatever thing that's feeling oh yes

198
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:51,520
whenever yes this is good so we're the refreshing part the sweet part the the

199
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:57,960
some people refer to as a beautiful experience that goes on yes we're into

200
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,079
this the relief of it the the the the

201
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:10,200
pleasure of it the goodness of it the healthiness of it yes and you can't make

202
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:16,319
this happen you can't um you know if you're uh if you don't feel that or know

203
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:21,839
that as a lived experience uh you don't have to can't be can't argue to someone

204
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:30,240
that the experience is Pleasant or wonderful it either is or isn't but when it is um in whatever way

205
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:38,000
it is yes let go into that goodness let go into feel that be it and some point

206
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,960
with this approach stage of meditation it becomes uh easier to stay with the

207
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,640
breathing than it is to go away you must still go away but it's almost like where

208
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:57,000
you want to be is with the breath there's a desire there's a goodness yes here's where I want to be and uh and so

209
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,240
the that you don't if the mind wanders off um it almost like will come back by

210
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:08,599
itself uh I used to have this sense the the feeling like there there was a

211
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:16,280
rubber band attached to my thoughts and I would start my thoughts would start wandering away and when it got the the

212
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:23,800
rubber band got taught enough it would bring back the thoughts into the present moment bring myself back it was not me

213
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:30,720
doing it so much it was like here stay here be here flow

214
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,520
along and uh so this approach stage the important part of it is that uh that

215
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:43,280
it's not so much work anymore to stay present it's not like continually coming back and being here coming back and

216
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:50,359
being here it's not continually relaxing softening it's it's um it's now we're

217
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:57,960
here and it feels like it's uh this feels like the right place to be and uh certainly there are plenty of

218
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:04,400
times where where even experienced meditators uh are beginners and it uh

219
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:11,440
it's just manual labor just uh we come back and out of confidence and Trust in the process and and just kind of do the

220
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,480
manual work of coming back from thinking Letting Go Starting Over Again starting

221
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,720
over again so we need to be gracious and appreciate that this is an important

222
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:28,520
part of meditation it's on a regular basis to be feel feeling like a

223
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:34,079
beginner but then at some point uh when the meditation the samade

224
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:40,880
begins to kind of uh there's a there's kind of a shift a kind of a um something

225
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:49,839
either it can be a gradual shift or a sudden shift that now it's it's uh it's the it's like the

226
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:56,400
the right place to be is with the breathing the right place to be is to be immersed this is good the system wants

227
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,599
to be here anything else just is not not so satisfying anymore and this Bel this

228
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:08,400
this starts to become the the approach stage of samama uh that we're

229
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:16,800
approaching a um a u pivotal pivotal moment where the samade is going to um

230
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:23,880
we're going to drop into a deeper samade that um so that'll be coming but uh this

231
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:31,160
approach stage where it's a this is good this is good and i i to describe all this to you so

232
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:36,880
that uh you can recognize when you're there and recognizing that this is also

233
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,200
part of meditation so at the right time you have a sense that this is possible

234
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,480
you're allowed to do this you're allowed to start releasing into it you're allowed to immerse yourself you're

235
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:55,680
allowed to immerse yourself in the joy and the pleasure and the goodness the rightness you Orient yourself towards it

236
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:01,440
so the mind is getting organized oriented stable

237
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,680
steady at ease here to

238
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:15,119
flow on the surface of the river of breathing go breathing in breathing out

239
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:21,440
just staying there and uh being massaged by it

240
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,920
being being nourished by it just there

241
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:34,040
so I hope that what I'm saying makes um enough sense for you either intuitively

242
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:39,200
or with your imagination or maybe even your experience sometimes that um you

243
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,760
can kind of like file it away and remember this so that uh and inspire you

244
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:52,920
that no matter what stage of meditation you're at uh this is an inspiring um process to be part of it's

245
00:44:52,920 --> 00:45:00,160
inspiring very natural process that's kind of built into our whole psychophysical system to have this

246
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:07,200
ability and it's kind of uh brings a lot of faith a lot of awe a lot of

247
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:14,160
inspiration to know yes yes this is

248
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:20,920
possible so thank you very much and um we'll continue with this approach

249
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,920
approach tomorrow
