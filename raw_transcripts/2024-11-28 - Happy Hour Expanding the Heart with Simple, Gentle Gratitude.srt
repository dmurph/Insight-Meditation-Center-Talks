1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,520
here we go great awesome well hello hello again and welcome everyone it's

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:13,639
lovely to be with you um yeah it it brings up happiness and joy and

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:19,880
gratitude for me to for this space of happy hour to exist for us practitioners

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,519
to come together from different places in this world from from our homes

5
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:33,399
don't have to drive anywhere and we can practice together so I'm I'm feeling

6
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,879
gratitude so so given that tomorrow is

7
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,640
Thanksgiving in in the United States um seems like an appropriate

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,879
theme to be practicing with gratitude so couple of words I want to

9
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,920
say and you might have heard them before but I want to invite you to listen to them with beginner's mind actually you

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:05,280
may not have heard them before so first of all gratitude is not a should is not a must

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,799
it's don't practice gratitude with a stick that I should be grateful for what

12
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,200
I have because there are people who are suffering that o ouch that's that

13
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:25,159
doesn't really help that doesn't expand our heart um instead ask a question can

14
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,640
I can I be grateful for this and this could be anything can I be grateful for

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,880
this and could be something uh good or Pleasant or a blessing in your life and and as we

16
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,079
continue to practice uh in this way with a sense of curiosity and interest and

17
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,000
open-heartedness then it actually becomes this practice becomes can I be

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,560
grateful for this challenge can I be grateful for this difficulty can I be grateful for this pain or something that

19
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:05,920
I usually am not grateful for I have perhaps an adverse of relationship with so this practice of gratitude in this

20
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,319
particular way that I'm offering inviting us to consider can be so

21
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,800
opening so expansive in to our heart in mind in

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,599
ways that we may not have considered in ways that maybe we just limited ourselves in the box of like yeah I

23
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,480
should be grateful for you um you know perhaps a tagline that is kids you might

24
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:38,440
have heard you you know be grateful and eat your peas because their kids starving and XYZ so so that's not very

25
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,920
helpful as as a perspective as an adult so I want to bring this this opening

26
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,480
this sense of curiosity can I be grateful for this can I be grateful for

27
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,720
this and let's start with things that are actually immediate um yeah two Dimension

28
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,319
so being grateful as I mentioned for things that are are blessings things

29
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,480
that are challenging so let's start with with things that are blessings let's

30
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,480
start there not we always start the meta and Brahma vhar and graditude practice

31
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:21,480
where it's easiest and then we build to where it's maybe a little more challenging so that's one dimension one

32
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,760
quadrant easy more difficult and then the other

33
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,599
quadrant the other axis is what's immediate what's right here right now

34
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:39,439
present in our bodies and in our Yeah in our bodies in our present environment

35
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:45,000
and then the other the end of the axis is what is in general in our lives or

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,080
has been or will be Etc so it's it's not immediate so that's another AIS so so

37
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,599
it's best to start in the quadrant which is right here and it's easy right here

38
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,920
right now we sense it feel it and it's really really easy um and it's

39
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:10,480
lightweight it's not heavy-handed and I also know many of you have had gratitude practice for a long

40
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,440
time um and yeah let's let's practice together it expands the heart it expands

41
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,320
the heart to possibilities to seeing goodness and countering our negativity

42
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:31,960
bias which all of us human beings do as part of our um yeah as a part of what

43
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:38,440
has been passed down to us genetically we all have negativity bias so let's uh

44
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,120
yeah gratitude helps expand the heart to see what's good for the benefit of

45
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,880
ourselves and others all right enough of a set up so let's uh let's

46
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,400
practice let's arrive in our bodies and if you need to

47
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,639

stories

104

air I'm breathing right now just this breath just this one so

108
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,240
intimate the air I'm breathing is so intimate

109
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:55,880
you can expand further perhaps the space you're sitting

110
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,079
in the shelter

111
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,760
that in this moment I'm protected from the

112
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,038
elements allowing the heart to have simple uplift

113
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:21,360
uplifted gratitude appreciation bowing to the

114
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:28,720
universe thank you all the causes and conditions

115
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:36,520
have brought this sense of protection safety from the elements

116
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,440
now we can expand further if you

117
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:16,080
like sense of appreciation for some of the people in your

118
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:25,679
life just bringing to mind or heart maybe one or two people or pets it's

119
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,679
okay we are interconnected

120
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,799
with and one person is enough doesn't have to be an expansive

121
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:44,760
list but if more people show up that's okay

122
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:59,000
too hang in here with gratitude for this web of mutual support interconnection

123
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,120
not to be taken for

124
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
granted

125
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

126
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,640
e e

127
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,559
in your own time you can expand further staying with each item that

128
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:19,080
arises maybe gratitude for health as much health as there is right

129
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,080
now

130
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:31,600
available stay with each blessing for a while so we're not

131
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,080
jumping from one thing to the next which can get the Mind

132
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:50,600
unsettled wherever your heart feels most

133
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:56,519
expensive there are no shs here

134
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:06,000
let expansiveness be your guide

135
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:04,360
and now if the heart and mind feel stable and expansive

136
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:11,320
enough maybe bring to Heart something that has been a little challenging lately not the most challenging thing

137
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:18,840
please don't choose that something a little of challenging and drop in the question in

138
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:24,960
your body not your head can I be grateful for this for how

139
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,440
it has stretched me or is stretching me

140
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:41,720
stay with it and if becomes really difficult in aive Let It Go come back to where it's

141
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:51,200
easy and if it's available to feel into it then

142
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,200
stay feeling into this reflection in the

143
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,278
body let the answers arise

144
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:49,000
remember don't push about gently

145
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,480
stretching but not

146
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
breaking

147
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320

148
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278

149
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:50,759

together can we be grateful appreciative of having showed up

151

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:36,679
review what the invitations were we started with getting embodied a bit and then

164
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:42,840
started with opening up to the breath as a way to soften

165
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:50,519
relax the body while we're sitting upright and then opening to appreciation for support of the chair the support of

166
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:56,320
the air the various supports that are available and then we expanded further

167
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,720
to to appreciate the support of the interconnections that we have with

168
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,919
people and we lingered there for a while we lingered on each of them for a while so that the mind doesn't get too jumpy

169
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:19,279
you know jumping from one item to the next it can become a thinking practice if we don't really have patience and

170
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:25,000
linger at the end I invited you to stretch a little bit and and if it's

171
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,600
felt okay to to bring a question of what uh can I be grateful for this

172
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:37,360
challenging thing that has been difficult for me uh recently and uh see

173
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:44,000
see what that might bring up so so

174
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:51,159
um so as uh as now we have the opportunity to practice in small groups

175
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:58,159
I also want to invite those who are on YouTube if you want to to hop on Zoom you are welcome to participate

176
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:04,640
participate in small groups you can go to IMC website and and get on Zoom or

177
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:11,080
happy hour so um yeah so the invitation for the

178
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:20,960
practice is uh is this I'm going to uh H in let's see oh yeah so we're

179
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:27,559
going to practice MTA meta practicing together and The

180
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:33,000
Meta practice mindfully uh speaking and and speaking

181
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:40,279
speaking and listening considering the small groups as a continuation of the practice embracing

182
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:46,399
compassion if there's something reactivity comes up to um to bring in

183
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:54,279
compassion for yourself and whatever might be happening in the space and um taking turns briefly

184
00:30:54,279 --> 00:31:00,799
staying on topic and the topic today is this so the

185
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:07,200
first round so we'll go to round first round

186
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,279
is one thing you're grateful for one thing just could be very simple you

187
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:17,720
could just say actually I felt really grateful for this chair that wow it's supporting me it's comfortable could be

188
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:26,159
just simply that or it could be oh yeah this this person in my life I'm grateful

189
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,840
for them that would just really that was what's was coming up in the practice just one thing that's the first round

190
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:41,840
and we're going to go um alphabetical order according to first name and the second round is if you did

191
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:49,279
experiment with the invitation can you be grateful for something that's challenging and and if there some

192
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:56,440
Reflection from that that you want to share um so maybe something like oh at

193
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,559
the beginning I broaden maybe I'm having you know some

194
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:07,519
health challenges or something and I can be grateful for that I wanted to go away and then I kept staying with it and

195
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,039
sitting with it and realize well actually because the pain is waking me up at 4:00 a.m. oh I'm getting to read

196
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:18,720
more I'm reading more W that's nice I'm grateful for reading more so it's uh

197
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,399
that's my practice support there there's always something to be grateful for right there's always something to be

198
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:30,720
grateful for so so that's the second round if you tried it if there's something and if it didn't work if there

199
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:38,840
was just reactivity like no no no I don't like this I'm not grateful for it it's okay totally fine totally okay so

200
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:45,000
that's the that's the second round so the first round what are you grateful for second round something challenging

201
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,159
perhaps and then you can do more rounds of either what you're grateful for or just more rounds if there is time and be

202
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:59,679
kind to yourself be kind to each other and um

203
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,760
okay I'm going to create the breakout rooms and I trust the instructions are

204
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:13,080
clear enough uh let's see here we go okay I'm creating the rooms take care of

205
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,360
yourselves take care of each other and enjoy enjoy the community space all

206
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:24,760
right opening the rooms here we go hello everyone welcome

207
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:31,559

208
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:38,600
chat is open too you can either raise your Zoom hand or um what you type it in

209
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:45,559

210
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,240
go bill

211
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:08,000
so when you talk about being grateful for challenges I picked just some minor conflicts at work not nothing

212
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,440
really big but I was truly grateful for it because I handled it well and it's because of the

213
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,760
practice and again I can compare I guess that's the comparing mind I shouldn't do that but no I can

214
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,960
look back years ago and I know I would not have handled it as well so I'm very

215
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,520
grateful ah I it's lovely thank you Bale thanks for sharing this this is so

216
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:38,440
lovely especially looking back that which is this is a actually a a wholesome comparison what you're doing

217
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:48,599
which is looking back at the Arc of your practice wow I'm not the person I used to be I've I've come a long way I'm um

218
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:55,118

226
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,400
