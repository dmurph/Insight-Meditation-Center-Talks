every morning when we wake up we have 24 brand new hours to live

64
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,160
what a precious gift what a precious carrot

65

we have the capacity to live in a way that these 24 hours will bring peace

66
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:59,360
joy and happiness to ourselves and others

67
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,960
such beautiful simple and profound teaching i'll continue

68
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,520
we can smile breathe walk and eat our meals

69
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,759
in a way that allows us to be in touch with the abundance of happiness that is

70
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:27,120
available that's a profound statement everyone happiness that is available

71
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,120
it's not that we have to search for it look for it happiness that's available here and now

72
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:40,639
if we change the way if we shift the perspective of the way we're looking

73
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,599
we can smile breathe walk and eat our meals in a way that allows us to be in touch with the abundance of happiness

74
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:55,199
that is available we are very good at preparing to live but not very good at living

75
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,800
we know how to sacrifice 10 years for a diploma and we are willing we are willing to

76
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,680
work very hard to get a job a car a house and so on but we have difficulty remembering that

77
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,879
we are alive in the present moment the only moment there is for us to be

78
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,479
alive every breath we take every step we make

79
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:27,840
can be filled with peace joy and serenity we need only to be awake

80
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,039
alive in the present moment this

81
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:39,518
paragraph especially resonated with me as many of you know is the course befriending mortality that i've been

82
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,839
teaching started this past week on wednesday so i've been really sitting with reflections and

83
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,360
about being alive and and and uh what does it mean to appreciate

84
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:59,279
being alive in this moment in this moment in this amazing mysterious miraculous

85
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,360
moment and this is what he's pointing to we are so good at preparing to live

86
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,680
always looking the future oh i will be happy when all everything is

87
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,160
okay i will be happy when i have my degree i will be happy when i have the perfect job the perfect

88
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,800
relationship the perfect this the i will be happy when i don't have to work so hard it's just like

89
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,200
the mentality of future orientation future orientation

90
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,720
and as he says but not very good at living not very good at living

91
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,279
he he is very gently pointing very gently pointing us right here right

92
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,200
now right here right now

93
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,920
every breath we take every step we make can be filled with peace

94
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:03,360
joy and serenity and we know this we know this in this sangha we know this that as we turn

95
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,480
you know as we turn our minds our hearts we can be

96
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,519
distracted and stressed out and we perhaps we come to happy hour and we sit and we practice together

97
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,200
and realize oh there is peace here yeah i had a hard day i had a rough day

98
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:28,480
and it's okay there's peace here right now in this tired body in this moment there's happiness there's joy there's

99
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,519
gratitude and this is something we have been exploring together

100
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:40,880
now over zoom and and youtube over the past two years now in every session it's

101
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,160
right here it's already here it's already here we just turn our

102
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,800
attention our perspective to it it's already here saying hello i'm here

103
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,560
so

104
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,200
and i want to offer this this

105
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,519

106
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,880
i guess what do i call it well he says he calls it um he says there okay he

107
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,959
says there are many extras there are so many exercises that we can do to help us breathe consciously

108
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:31,600
besides a simple in-out exercise we can recite these four lines silently as we breathe in and out and many of you might

109
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,640
be already familiar with these four simple lines and i know that i have used

110
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:43,120
them before and then just they just bring joy and calm so so i'd like to invite us

111
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,320
to practice with these four simple lines tonight breathing in

112
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:56,760
i calm my body breathing out i smile

113
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,320
dwelling in the present moment i know

114
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,839
this is a wonderful moment read them one more

115
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,800
time breathing in i calm my body

116
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:21,360
breathing out i smile and let yourself smile we've explored that before in

117
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,639
in on this in the previous sessions breathing out i smile

118
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:36,839
dwelling in the present moment i know this is a wonderful moment

119
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:46,240
so there's a lot more commentary but um [Music] well maybe i'll just say a little more

120
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,880
breathing and i call my body reciting this line is like drinking a glass of cool lemonade on a hot day isn't that

121
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,000
sweet i just love his language you can feel the coolness permeate your

122
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,519
body when i breathe in and recite this line i actually feel my breath calming

123
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,440
my body and mind breathing out i smile you know a smile

124
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,600
can relax hundreds of muscles in your face wearing a smile on your face is a sign

125
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,200
that you are a master of yourself and we also know that

126
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,240
by the way smiling changes has has other impacts not just in the muscles of the

127
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:33,680
face but also other physiological and psychological impacts so please do smile

128
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,800
dwelling in the present moment while i sit here i don't think of anything else

129
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,240
i sit here and i know exactly where i am

130
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:52,000
and the last one i know this is a wonderful moment it is a joy to sit stable

131
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,839
and at ease and return to our breathing or smiling our true nature

132
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,880
our appointment with life is in the present moment i love that our

133
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,600
appointment with life we all have an appointment with life our appointment with life is in the

134
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,800
present moment if we do not have peace and joy right now

135
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,920
when will we have peace and joy tomorrow

136
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,600
or after tomorrow what is preventing us from being happy

137
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,839
right now that's such a profound teaching

138
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,800
as we follow our breathing we can say simply calming smiling present moment

139
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,480
wonderful moment this exercise is not just for beginners

140
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,839
many of us who have practic practice meditation and conscious breathing for 40 or 50 years continue to practice in

141
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,199
the same way because this kind of exercise is so important

142
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,959
and so easy so

143
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:11,600

or anything else for that matter

288
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:05,119
we are a quiet bunch tonight i think somebody's trying to raise their

289
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:11,119
hand but actually that's the clap there

290
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,760
somebody raised their hand they'll ask you to unmute

291
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:25,680
so i was at the store so i wasn't quite sure what you were talking about but i

292
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,680
think that you're mentioning about um every day you have a 24 hours

293
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:37,040
to make a day bright or something like that

294
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:42,240
i i was reading i was reading from uh since you joined late i was reading from

295
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,400
pieces every step which is a book by tik natan i was reading the very first chapter and yeah that's that's what he

296
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:55,760
was writing oh i see yeah so so i think that these days i'm like

297
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,960
almost every single day um i'm very like negative

298
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:08,079
my friends told me you're very uh why don't you just see uh take things like positively every single

299
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:14,160
day i mean every day that would be really nice having a different perspective of the

300
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,680
same things but you know it was not really easy but when i heard that words

301
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,640
from you and i'm thinking oh yeah right

302
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:31,200
well things not gonna go as always that you want it and a lot of things makes me

303
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:37,680
really disappointed too but i still have a 24 hours every day making

304
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:44,079
things brighter and nicer make it oh yeah something like that so

305
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:49,920
it's it was kind of struck me uh when i heard that sentence and yeah

306
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:57,839
yeah beautiful i appreciate that yeah and so if if it really spoke to you then i would recommend

307
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:04,640
finding um pieces every step this book by take not on because there's so much simple wizard no it's just the first

308
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:11,040
chapter i read uh parts of it paragraphs of it and also i would maybe say one more thing in

309
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:18,960
what you shared about oh yeah this this negativity that we bring in this it's really a perspective that we bring in

310
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,319
to our day to every moment of of living and having a different perspective

311
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:29,599
can shift our our lives our perception because it's it's really

312
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:36,160
deeply deeply you know is this what i'm about to say it both seems like a very simple

313
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:44,400
sentence but it's actually a profound insight and mystical insight that everything

314
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,839
everything is our perception everything is our perception everything

315
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:57,200
even when you say well i'm disappointed things are not going my way that's also a perception because if one is limited

316
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:05,520
to this limited view of me me me i want this it's good for me like ah actually even that is a perception so

317
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:11,440
it's a radically different way of being in the world so i'll leave you with that thank you

318
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,480
vicky please

319
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:27,040
i i was thinking about some of the pressures some of the things that

320
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:35,599
seem to be obligations to do and how to be in peace with that and and actually do them

321
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:41,520
because peace he seems to be [Music]

322
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,960
sitting and quiet and how to stay with that as we

323
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,599
take care of things that are what i i should do you know but i prefer

324
00:47:53,599 --> 00:48:02,720
to prune the garden how to stay in peace with less desirable

325
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,720
lists of things to do because it's it's a perception but if i don't do them

326
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,839
you know the bills won't get paid so if i'm

327
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:22,079
you're cutting out a little bit here and there so it's just to make sure i hurt with the reflection that you're sharing

328
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:28,160
that when you're sitting quietly in meditation that lots of different things are coming up and

329
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:35,680
and how to be no no in meditation is very peaceful

330
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:42,720
but during the day each step is uh if i'm useful i'll be sitting

331
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:50,000
oh actually i would like to to challenge you you how can you be peaceful in the

332
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,240
middle of busyness in the middle of doing this and that and the other can

333
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:04,720
you hold your peace and it is possible if it weren't possible i wouldn't suggest it vicky that right yeah

334
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:10,319
yeah so having peace you know this i'm not saying anything you don't know but

335
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:16,240
having peace doesn't mean that you'll just sit and meditate all day it's it's how can we train ourselves in this

336
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:22,400
practice i mean being a good buddhist or a good practitioner isn't that you just check out and you just you know hang out

337
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:28,240
it's like you in every interaction in ways that you show up you have peace

338
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:34,720
yeah yeah we're bringing that in yeah i think i got the point yeah right yes is that what you're talking

339
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:40,240
about i mean not that i'm peaceful every moment no but that's the intention

340
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:46,400
yeah yeah beautiful yes yeah cultivation and it is possible

341
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,079

352

at yourself and each other just like wow these amazing human beings and um

353

354
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:15,119
we've got a couple minutes left for any last minute reflections comments

355
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:20,838
questions neil please

356
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:34,000
so the instruction the first phrase is i forget while i breathe in i relax the

357
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:42,079
body right and it seems really difficult for me to relax on the inhale

358
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:48,000
yeah yeah i see heads nodding here so yeah yeah yeah it

359
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,119
okay yeah so right right and you know

360
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:58,160
i i mean i'm okay not doing it that way but i mean why did he word it that way

361
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:04,480
if you know if it's there's not some point to it oh yeah yeah so i'm so glad you brought

362
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,680
this up so here are the two pointers i would give

363
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:15,520
first the way he words it actually is breathing in i calm the body

364
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,319
and there's a difference between relaxing and calming

365
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,839
tune into that meal and you'll feel a difference because

366
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:35,359
the in-breath can be calming to the body it can be tuned into how the

367
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:42,480
wow how the in-breath wow how the in birth can be calming

368
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,920
it can be so like something that has not yet been opened up for you to be opened

369
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:55,119
up it's not right away it's not on the surface it takes a little bit of tuning into but i

370
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:00,720
have no doubt that you will you'll feel it you'll tune into it

371
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:08,480
does that sound okay it sounds exciting i look forward to it i'm excited for you neil being excited

372
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:14,480
