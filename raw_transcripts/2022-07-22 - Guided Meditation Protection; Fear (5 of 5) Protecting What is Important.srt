1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,279
welcome and uh

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,799
at the moment my wish in welcoming you is certainly welcome you to this

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:19,520
meditation and in a sense to imc online but i would like really to welcome you

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:28,000
to yourself that when we sit down to meditate ideally there's a we welcome ourselves

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,360
we offer a welcome to however we are at the moment

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,760
sometimes you're astray we're a stranger to ourselves sometimes we're know ourselves all too well

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,520
sometimes we come in all kinds of moods it's like a stranger or a neighbor who

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,440
you never know to come knocking on your door and they have a need and you welcome them in

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,800
and um so so are you meditation is a time to welcome yourself

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,359
in and when we meditate

11
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,799
there is a healthy and unhealthy fear

12
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,119
there is helpful and unhelpful fear there's fear that pulls us away from the

13
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:22,080
present moment there's fear that in which we freeze or get lost

14
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:28,880
there's fear which keeps us apart from our experience of the moment

15
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:36,159
there's also the fear that keeps us in the present there's a fear that keeps us close to a

16
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,560
sense of peace non-conflict ease or calm

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,960
and that is the fear of losing that the fear of losing our balance losing

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,759
our peace losing our well-being

19
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,920
because it's that's a worthwhile fear to have because in two ways

20
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,520
when we lose our well-being our balance then we're much more likely to

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,560
create more problems for ourselves more stress

22
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,360
when we protect our peace if there's if there's some fear like

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,120
that like don't don't lose that this is dangerous to lose this peace danger still lose myself

24
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,879
dangerous to lose my welcome to myself and really be present here

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,959
that fear might encourage us to let go of the other fears

26
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,239
that take us away that fear leads us maybe motivates us

27
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,480
to protect our mindfulness our presence our being here

28
00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:00,000
and in doing that this secondary is protecting our practice protecting their inner well-being

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,560
if if there's fear connected to that a protective fear that hopefully won't be stressful

30
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,040
because it's pointing you back to that place of the absence of stress

31
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,680
it's the protection it's the safeguard it's the fear

32
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,799
that points us back where there is no fear because we know it's dangerous to lose

33
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:32,319
it so here we are welcome

34
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:39,840
and to gently close your eyes

35
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,840
and what do you welcome

36
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,920
what is happening with you right now that you're gonna open your door and

37
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,239
welcome in and this is what's happening

38
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,480
and you are the welcomer if you're distressed you're not the

39
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,760
distress you welcome the distress

40
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,959
if you're calm you are not the calm you welcome it whatever there is

41
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,919
welcome it here in this body this mind

42
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,960
feeling and sensing how you are

43
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,440
and then within this body

44
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,800
allowing yourself to take a few deeper breaths

45
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,280
as you inhale feel a fuller maybe a stronger connection

46
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,800
to what is here for you how you are what you're feeling

47
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,199
in a longer exhale than usual let go relax

48
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,000
soften the body

49
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,639
here the inhale is almost like a welcome here

50
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,000
let me feel you let me recognize what's happening

51
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:33,800
and exhaling settling in relaxing into the middle of it

52
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,720
letting your breathing become normal

53
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:09,360
and still on the exhale soften relax wherever you can in your

54
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,720
body even if it's micro muscles

55
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,360
let there be a gentle movement of relaxation throughout the body

56
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,720
sometimes in particular spots sometimes the whole body

57
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,400
almost as if you're relaxing into how you are

58
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,039
relaxing into what you welcome here now

59
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,120
and then continue as you exhale to relax a bit

60
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,000
but let the welcomer relax that part of you that knows that feels

61
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,759
that's recognizes what's happening let that relax

62
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:09,759
so that your awareness your mindfulness has no fear in it

63
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:20,319
no hesitation relax the witnesser the welcomer the

64
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,160
the awareness of it all

65
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,680
and then sitting here so far is there something about how you are

66
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,800
some inner sense of balance or calm or peace

67
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,360
in your sense of openness and welcoming something

68
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,279
that's appropriate to protect

69
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:57,279
it's appropriate there's a healthy concern maybe fear

70
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,440
of drifting away from being connected to yourself being present here

71
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,800
there's a danger in drifting away from whatever

72
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,480
whatever degree of calm or presence

73
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,839
here there is

74
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,320
maybe there's a way of being motivated by that fear that concern

75
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,240
to love and stay close to

76
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,680
that place within where there's a sense of well-being

77
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,240
or the place within where there could be a sense of well-being

78
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,720
close

79
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,000
stay close to the place that's safe inside

80
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,000
and through these minutes of meditation

81
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,360
have you come to a time a place where you have a clear sense that there's

82
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:25,280
something here to protect to nourish to support

83
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,200
to safegarden some sense of well-being or clarity or

84
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,200
calm

85
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:50,880
and maybe there's a healthy concern of fear

86
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:58,799
that motivates you to stay close to that well-being

87
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,600
not to lose it

88
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,039
so

89
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,679
and as we come to the end of the sitting

90
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:26,320
perhaps you can consider whether there's a healthy fear

91
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:34,720
that is the fear of losing our respect and love and care for others

92
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:41,360
even losing it temporarily or having it be eclipsed by other feelings

93
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:47,440
the fear of losing a kind regard

94
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:56,158
of others and maybe this is worth protecting

95
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:03,840
maybe there's never an occasion to be mean or hostile

96
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:14,960
or unfriendly and so to fear

97
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,440
going in those directions and that for that fear to be motivating

98
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,278
to stay close to your kindness your friendliness

99
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,559
or maybe it's meaningful for you

100
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:50,320
to wish well in others may may all beings be happy

101
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:58,080
may all beings be safe

102
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,640
may all beings be peaceful

103
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,039
may all beings be free

104
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:26,849
[Music]

105
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,600
thank you so we come to

106
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:42,720
the last and fifth talk on fear and i hope that thing during this week

107
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,279
i've been able to offer you some new perspectives on

108
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:55,360
practicing with fear living with fear understanding fear and

109
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,799
i'll continue with that today and

110
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:07,279
i thought of maybe that the subject for today would be the wisdom of fear

111
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:14,559
and part of the wisdom of fear is that or how to understand that the wisdom that fear can

112
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:19,760
be wise is when we think that one of the functions of fear

113
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,679
is to is protection it's an attempt to protect something

114
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:33,039
and then what are we protecting what is being threatened

115
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,039
and and some things are worth protecting

116
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,880
some things are not worth protecting and so there is this notion in buddhism

117
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,000
that there is healthy fear and unhealthy fear helpful fear and

118
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,279
unhelpful fear so to have a categorical attitude towards fears being wrong or bad

119
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:04,399
is not so useful what's useful is to practice with fear to normalize

120
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:10,159
fear to not identify with fear to learn to hold fear

121
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:16,320
with kindness to hold it [Music] gently so you can really see it and know

122
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,600
it and and it's helpful to have it you know

123
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,880
sit on your shoulder and accompany you rather than be you

124
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,279
all things that i've talked about this week and um

125
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,480
but then it's also important to be able to look deeply at fear and is this

126
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,320
healthy this fear is this helpful this fear is it this really protecting me in an

127
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,559
important way is it really a protection or is it is that is it the opposite am i

128
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:56,399
actually more in danger by having this fear because some fears and anxiety

129
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:03,360
especially anxieties that are quite strong probably put us in greater danger

130
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,120
than if we don't have it we're more likely to make mistakes we're more likely to act impulsively

131
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:16,480
we're more likely to some some anxieties are self-fulfilling

132
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,360
that if we're anxious something's going to happen that very anxiety makes it more likely to happen

133
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:30,240
sometimes it's the analogy that sometimes is used around dogs if you're afraid of a dog the dog is

134
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:37,200
more likely to attack you and so the more anxiety there's around the dog we want to protect ourselves but

135
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,039
the very movement of anxiety is the thing that that

136
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:49,120
keeps us from being protected and um so we have to kind of look at what is

137
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,840
what are we afraid of here and is it a healthy or not healthy and if it's a healthy fear we're

138
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:02,240
protecting something worthwhile then the fear has a function

139
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:09,679
of being motivating there's energy in fear and that energy can be motivated to do something

140
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:16,399
to actually do something that protects what needs to be protected and sometimes that's to do things in the

141
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:23,120
world and maybe put a lock on your door for example if

142
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:30,880
that's what's going to keep you safe and sometimes it's um to really

143
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,159
practice the careful self-monitoring

144
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:42,799
so that you don't succumb to unhelpful states of mind you don't succumb to

145
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:49,120
anxiety or anger or hostility or greed

146
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,880
and you don't succumb to attachments that are maybe even the source of the fear

147
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:01,679
itself and so the fear a healthy fear protects what's

148
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,960
needs should can be protected it's helpful to protect

149
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:13,679
and so what are some of the things that are helpful and healthy to protect

150
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:20,638
certainly our integrity our ethical integrity because one of the sources of fear

151
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,480
is when we live unethically and afraid of being caught or or

152
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:33,720
afraid of our own conscience it's also uh um

153
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:40,560
uh you know there's a fear of wrongdoing so there's fear so that if there's a

154
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:47,599
healthy fear of no i don't want to do that i don't want to lie i don't want to to get in that kind of situation and

155
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,960
that keeps us from doing it keeps us even getting into those situations and

156
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,480
the deeper and more peaceful meditators tend to become the more likely they're going to have a

157
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,560
fear for somehow harming themselves with their ethics

158
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,599
or harming anybody with their ethics the fear of causing harm

159
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:15,599
that's a healthy fear and it can be an anxious fear it can be a

160
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,200
neurotic fear not to harm others and that that maybe won't be so helpful

161
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:28,079
but if there is a healthy not wanting to cause harm it's like the heart's the heart sings when it doesn't cause

162
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,359
harm their hearts stop singing when you think about causing harm or i think we have

163
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:40,480
caused harm and so that's worth protecting being close to

164
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:47,119
and and then there's a sense of well-being we get whatever that is i use that word very vaguely

165
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:55,599
that as we practice as we go through our lives there are times when we feel a degree of peace happiness

166
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,520
connectedness that is nourishing supportive for us

167
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,960
brings us joy and delight and that's worth protecting

168
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:14,000
it's remarkable how easy it is to give it up how easy it is to get distracted and cut up and sometimes very petty

169
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,200
concerns that that to really wipe away

170
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:26,880
the sense of balance the sense of inner strength or peace that we might have

171
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,200
and that's so it's worth protecting that so how do we protect that maybe we protect it by being careful

172
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:39,040
with what we watch on tv you know maybe we're careful what we uh

173
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,960
who we spend time with or how much time we spend with people maybe we're careful about where we go or

174
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:53,760
what the activities we do because some activities like like uh you know watching at a shopping channel or

175
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:01,839
looking at catalogs maybe stimulates um unhealthy desires and attachment and

176
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,880
that the stairs stirs up and causes us to lose the fact that we were pretty content before we looked at the catalog

177
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,599
and so to um to be

178
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,800
so fear the wisdom of fear is to understand that fear is trying to protect something and is what it's

179
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,320
protecting worthwhile is it appropriate is it helpful for us

180
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:37,480
so there's this uh used to be read quite a bit this quote by krishna murthy

181
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,160
there is fear as long as you want to be secure

182
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,200
secure in your marriage secure in your job secure in your position

183
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,480
secure in your responsibility secure in your ideas

184
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:02,079
in your beliefs secure in your relationships to the world and in your relationship to god

185
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,280
at the moment the mind seeks security or gratification in any form

186
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,240
at any level there is bound to be fear

187
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,320
so there can be attachment to a security to a certainty

188
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,359
in a world that has much more uncertainty than we often will admit

189
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:33,760
and so our is all these things we try to search for try to hold on to for our security

190
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,760
and then is that really the right place to feel secure

191
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,599
for the buddha the ultimate security ultimate safety

192
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:53,280
is found in letting go is found in peace isn't found in non-attachment non-clinging

193
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:01,520
and that can make us feel very vulnerable very challenged but to find strength courage

194
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,119
stability in that place of non-clinging non-attachment

195
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:14,400
and realize that that is portable and learn how to take that with us in all the insecure situations in life all

196
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,079
the uncertain places in life life is uncertain there is dangers in life

197
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:27,040
but the biggest danger is that of what we do to ourselves through our

198
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:34,480
attachments through our karma the actions we do through the dispositions of the mind to

199
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,680
hate or to be greedy or be caught up in something so that

200
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,040
we get we lose ourselves we lose ourselves in anxiety

201
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:52,000
there is a place of security within that it's worth protecting is worth finding

202
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,520
getting close to and and the place where

203
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:04,880
it's a place within that is cannot be threatened no matter what happens in the world

204
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:11,520
that place is not touched and to be centered there to know that

205
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,599
is the ability to go through the world with out fear

206
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:24,880
but until we get to that place that point any hints or sense of that possibility of

207
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:32,480
that inner well-being that that moves in that direction that should that can be protected

208
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:40,560
that we want to be careful for that is worthwhile protecting um because we're moving

209
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:47,440
towards freedom we're moving to the place where we're really bringing ourselves bring the healthiest

210
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:55,200
the greatest health to ourselves the greatest spiritual health the greatest freedom to our hearts

211
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,280
so fear is an all-too-human experience it's a

212
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,359
there's healthy and it's a it's it's there's it wants to protect us it's a kind of in and of itself a healthy

213
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:13,599
movement of protecting something so we don't want to dismiss fear

214
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,440
we want to be able to be friends with fear and connect to fear see it deeply

215
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:26,480
because as we see it deeply in our present for it all fear all movements of protection

216
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,720
probably at the very root of what they're about is

217
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:40,560
is this place of ultimate safety this or this desire for ultimate safety

218
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:46,960
and many fears are mis understandings many fears is misunderstanding what's

219
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,560
really important meditation like meditation

220
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,560
hopefully will connect us to what is most important so that we remember that as we go into

221
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,240
the world and we don't fear things which are not that important

222
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:11,680
that doesn't matter so much there's plenty of things that we might fear that we don't have to worry about

223
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,279
so um i'd like to end with a quote from martin luther king

224
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:27,760
that brings this topic of fear into our social domain

225
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,920
martin luther king jr wrote people fail to get along

226
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,480
because they fear each other they fear each other because they don't

227
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:47,760
know each other they don't know each other because they have not communicated with

228
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:54,240
each other so to the degree to which we are afraid of others

229
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,079
maybe we haven't really gotten to know them and maybe we really haven't let them

230
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:06,800
know us maybe to develop real communication between people

231
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:15,359
is one of the benefits of becoming wise with fear because then fear does not interfere

232
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:21,040
with our ability to communicate connect and and

233
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,599
have real friendship with other people

234
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,240
so thank you for all this and uh

235
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,680
may you now take a time to really

236
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:44,560
become wise about your fear maybe even courageous around it

237
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:50,079
so i'm going away again next week for another week of vacation this summer
