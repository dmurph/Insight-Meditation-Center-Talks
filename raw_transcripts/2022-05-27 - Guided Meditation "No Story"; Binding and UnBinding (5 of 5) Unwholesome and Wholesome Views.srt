1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,240
so hello everyone the warm greetings from

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,240
inside meditation center and

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,960
for this morning meditation i'd like to offer you a small technique

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,359
that works particularly well in meditation and with wisdom

5
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:37,440
works very well in daily life as well and it's called the one breath reset

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,000
one breath reset and that is if you find yourself

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,280
involved in storytelling in your mind and storytelling means having a

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:57,039
conversation with someone imagining some scenario remembering some scenario in the past

9
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,239
planning some scenario in the future story can be

10
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,320
uh making a story about the meditation itself that uh

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,880
you know conclusion this is uh impossible or boy i'm uh only

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,600
two breaths away from full enlightenment or you know whatever it might be if you find yourself involved in a story while

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,799
you're meditating do the one breath reset

14
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,400
and that is on the inhale gently lovingly

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,600
you say the word no and then finish the sentence on the

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,079
exhale with the word story breathing in no

17
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,960
exhaling story no story

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,640
and the alternative to storytelling and the reason to use this reset one breath

19
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,479
reset is uh we're cultivating clarity in the present moment

20
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,520
clear awareness clear attention to the present moment

21
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,200
and for many of us the anchor the the

22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,120
the center of that clarity is being cultivated with breathing

23
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,040
and the simplicity of breathing the tuning in becoming clearer and clearer

24
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,800
on the ex the body's experience of breathing and the one and then find yourself in

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,120
stories i'm like you know i'm i'm breathing the wrong way

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,680
that's if you're too involved in that kind of idea it's a story and and then no

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,560
story one breath reset if it helps you the inhale can be

28
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,840
a little bit bigger than usual and so this the exhale and the nose story has a

29
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,040
little bit more uh strength to it

30
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,440
but i wouldn't do it too strongly just uh just a little bit more emphasis to it and a little bit kind of like you more

31
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,720
wholeheartedly you're involved in the process of letting go of story as you exhale

32
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,120
so um so maybe you won't need it today but if

33
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,239
you do then it can be quite effective the one breath

34
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:31,000
reset so to

35
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,879
feel your posture that you're in now before doing any other changes

36
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,560
notice how you are in your body

37
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,680
feeling your body from the inside

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,280
and almost as if you're discovering what the body wishes

39
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,760
and adjust your posture a bit so your body feels more

40
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:15,840
comfortable more aligned but also more

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,359
supportive of becoming alert and clear here and now

42
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,198
gently closing your eyes

43
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,199
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

44
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,160
breathing in deeply and feeling your body

45
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:57,400
exhaling releasing relaxing your body

46
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:09,199
and if you're already involved in story you might do the one breath reset

47
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,479
a practice that sometimes needs to be done repeatedly

48
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

49
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:34,320
and is it as if you can get kind of deep inside your body

50
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,320
from the inside out as you exhale relax the muscles of your

51
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,320
face

52
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,478
on the exhale softening the shoulders

53
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,280
releasing the shoulders to the pull of gravity

54
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,680
maybe there are small adjustments in where your hands are placed

55
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,319
that might loosen up your shoulders a bit more

56
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:41,639
and softening your belly releasing the stomach the belly

57
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:08,440
this so

58
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,879
and also as if you can feel deep inside your mind

59
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,800
see if you can relax your mind on the exhale softening

60
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:43,120
on the exhale as if the mind can become broad and quiet like the surface of a

61
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,840
quiet lake

62
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:10,599
and then settling awareness into the body's experience of breathing

63
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,959
as if maybe curtains are pulled from the window of the mind

64
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,880
of attention let the curtains be pulled so that you

65
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,959
can experience breathing more clearly

66
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:56,760
experience that know the body's experience of breathing

67
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,000
and then whenever it's useful

68
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:35,040
do the one breath reset with the no on the inhale

69
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,040
and story on the exhale

70
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,320
be sure to say the words in a relaxed way

71
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,399
gentle way

72
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,360
so that it supports the quieting of the mind

73
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,519
the stilling of the story making mind

74
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,959
here

75
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,160
so

76
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,760
so

77
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,560
so

78
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,320
so

79
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,560
so

80
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,800
so

81
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
so

82
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,840
the one breath reset

83
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,600
can give the mind and the heart a much needed vacation

84
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,880
from storytelling meaning making

85
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:36,559
predictions and planning letting it all go

86
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,159
reset back to clarity to this moment

87
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,600
so

88
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,840
so

89
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:18,480
when we can clear our minds enough of stories

90
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:27,120
stories of other people that we meet it doesn't negate the stories

91
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:33,200
maybe they're accurate but it gives us a chance to see people

92
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,919
freshly to see how they are now

93
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:47,799
without seeing them through the filter of how they were or what happened

94
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:54,240
and what's one of the gifts that's possible to come from meditation

95
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:04,320
or from mindfulness this ability to reset the mind enough

96
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,559
to see people clearly as they are now

97
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,360
and therefore be able to listen to them better take them in better more

98
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:26,080
and know them this can be for strangers and friends

99
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,240
and the chances are as we get to know people more clearly and freshly

100
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:39,440
it's easier to have good will easier to feel connected to their humanity and

101
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:50,399
and perhaps or something we learn through this meditation some way that we're changed

102
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,679
that we can bring with us to our social interactions

103
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:02,320
to our concerns and care for people we don't interact with

104
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:11,720
may we be predisposed to good will towards others

105
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:19,679
may all beings be happy may all beings

106
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,799
be safe may all beings

107
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:31,679
be peaceful may all beings be free

108
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:41,200
and may we support that possibility maybe in the way in which we

109
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:50,120
encounter others may all beings be happy

110
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:11,940
[Music]

111
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,279
so good morning and we come to the

112
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,080
last day this five part series on

113
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,880
aspects of our mind or mental activity that

114
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:47,760
can be both wholesome and unwholesome helpful and unhelpful

115
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,159
and because they look similar to each other it's possible to confuse them confused

116
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,519
be confused by what part is wholesome what is whole when it's wholesome and when it's not wholesome when it's

117
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:05,840
useful and not useful so um

118
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,240
today's topic is in palis the word ditty and

119
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,600
and is usually translated into english as views

120
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,440
and views stories opinions philosophies that we have

121
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,200
can be a source of binding of being bondage of being caught

122
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,200
but views can also be a source of freedom setting us free

123
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,200
of wisdom and guidance helpful guidance in our lives and so

124
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:49,278
in buddhist english there's a tendency of treating the english word views

125
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:57,840
to refer to unhelpful opinions stories philosophies

126
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,159
metaphysical ideas about what's happening here in this world of ours

127
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:11,039
and now because it is a strong tendency of kind of pointing out that views are unhealthy

128
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:16,639
that sometimes people have the idea they're not supposed to have any

129
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:23,919
understandings any stories any interpretations any

130
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:30,640
wisdom or understanding that guides them in their life that supports them and is appropriate to have

131
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,880
and so um so but there are these two different possibilities

132
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,480
and so the word diti in as it's used in nepali sutas

133
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,919
is overwhelmingly used to refer to something like speculative views

134
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,919
to fixed views and these two things speculative and fixed are significant

135
00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:01,440
speculative means opinions and views about things that we can't know directly

136
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,279
so they're interpretations or stories or or

137
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,640
about something that um and then fixed views

138
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,919
is when we're caught in and attached to the view so being

139
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:24,320
opinionated about our view meaning this is you know holding on this is the truth this is how it is

140
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:30,000
and the fixed views can even be for views understandings

141
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,600
that that are healthy are appropriate in and of themselves but

142
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,039
the way that we hold them there's a there's suffering involved there's attachment there's clinging to the views

143
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,880
i'm right and everyone else is wrong and so this attachment to

144
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,399
to our philosophies our opinions can be

145
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:57,440
operating whether or not our opinions are accurate and this is an important thing to

146
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,200
consider for those of you who have accurate opinions accurate ideas of what's going on accurate stories and of

147
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,720
what happened is that the way you hold those can be a source

148
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:15,838
of suffering for yourself and to others when there's an insistence and a dogmatic attachment to it

149
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:22,480
so um so a lot of buddhist practice is about

150
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:29,679
overcoming the speculative views dogmatic views views that are speculating about the

151
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:36,398
nature of reality nature of human being nature of our life nature of liberation

152
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:43,280
and discovering how to have in the views the understandings that come

153
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:50,158
out of seeing something directly to having direct experience for oneself

154
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,520
uh when we first get introduced to buddhism maybe that [Music]

155
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:02,560
we take a little bit the teachings the ideas the maybe even the philosophies a little bit on faith

156
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,960
enough faith that we're willing to do the practice but it's provisional faith this provisional view and we understand this

157
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,680
is provisional it's uh i've reasoned it out it seems like this is the best pretty good

158
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:21,359
but let's now find out and the idea is that we're moving the direction of

159
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:27,440
insight where our understanding comes from direct experience for

160
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,440
ourselves and so the what we the what we don't know yet from personal

161
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:40,079
experience that is taken on provisionally as something that we can discover for

162
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,200
ourselves so you can use a little bit reflection to think about

163
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,000
philosophies views religious thought ideas

164
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:57,599
metaphysical ideas that might be attractive and seem right to you but you might realize i can never

165
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,720
prove it for myself and so this is maybe outside the reach of

166
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,880
of direct experience and direct sensory experience and so

167
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,880
so if you want to hold on to that then you know that you can't discover this for yourself whether it's true it

168
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,000
becomes a article of faith and in

169
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,440
what we're looking for in buddhism are those understandings those views that we believe can be verified for

170
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:34,320
ourselves we can discover for ourselves and so something simple as

171
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,760
the idea the story that if you cling you will suffer and if that clinging is

172
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,880
released the suffering is released as well that is something that belongs to the

173
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,280
area of of direct experience it might not be easy to experience but

174
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,520
it is something that with time we can start seeing how that works so yeah in fact i was clinging

175
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,200
and that then i suffered before i clung i was no suffering

176
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:09,119
um and so to be and to begin uh and so a big

177
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:16,000
thing that buddhism teaches is that all our experiences are inconstant

178
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,200
and this is a kind of a central tenant held up high as a very important but it's

179
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:30,079
meant to be an insight that we can verify for ourselves and so the view of life that we get

180
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,440
through practice is a view that's built on this deeper and deeper appreciation of how

181
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,560
things are changing all the time impermanent in constant

182
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,320
and with time we see how this insight has a liberating quality

183
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,160
how how freeing us up from the the idea of constancy or the idea of

184
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,880
permanence the idea of fixidity makes us much more

185
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,320
valuable and fluid and adaptable to all the changes that go on all the time in

186
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:10,160
life the um uh you know there's a there's a view in

187
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:16,160
buddhism that there is no self that there's that view that people sometimes

188
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,920
advocate it's not actually what the buddha taught and with some reflection maybe you can

189
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,960
appreciate that maybe you can't really discover that there is no self how would you know

190
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,480
that what the buddha focused on is what you can know for yourself

191
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,240
and what you can know is that particular things in your experience

192
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:48,320
are not don't qualify as a definition of who i am and uh this is myself

193
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,119
so um

194
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:00,800
and how you know to so the movement is to see what in our experience that i took as

195
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:07,920
myself that is not really how i fundamentally am that actually to hold on to that is a

196
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,520
kind of suffering it is kind of a wind drag that slows me down

197
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,440
and that not to identify with that is actually more freedom and more ease in my life

198
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:26,800
but it's always something particular and as practice gets deeper and deeper all the particulars in our life are seen

199
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,800
as not self but it's but it's not an idea that there is no self

200
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,000
but it's also not the idea that there is a self the philosophy idea of what is and is

201
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,680
not a self that's considered a speculative view that we don't get involved in

202
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,960
what we get involved in is what we can see directly and know for ourselves

203
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:56,560
so um so in the understandings the views the unders that come from insight

204
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,880
that come from direct experience those we rely on in practice they can give a

205
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,800
sense of purpose a direction to our lives they can guide our lives in a certain way

206
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:15,280
when we see clearly that there is a possibility to suffer less we see it's possible to let go of

207
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:22,480
clinging it's possible to see below the fixed views that we have the interpretations we have and see things

208
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,160
more directly for ourselves this can give be a powerful

209
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,960
inspiration and motivation to to continue on this path of freedom in

210
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,400
their direct experience and uh and not to get hung up in

211
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:48,880
speculative philosophies which maybe we can never ascertain for ourselves directly

212
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:56,480
and if there are philosophies that we can ascertain for ourselves directly some way then if we're motivated we can go and

213
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,400
practice to see how we can discover that for ourselves

214
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:10,079
the buddha said once that in describing his teaching he said i just point out the way

215
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,839
it's up to you to walk the path and so to this

216
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:22,640
appreciating what we can discover through a direct experience that shows us what that path is that we

217
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,920
walk so we can get

218
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,440
we can get wrapped up caught up in opinions and stories and views and

219
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:40,160
philosophies about how things are or we can

220
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,680
have kind of understandings philosophies steven stories

221
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:51,920
that point to freedom beyond stories that point us to how to be free here

222
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,359
in the direct experience opening up to what's really here in a deeper way

223
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:03,520
and then discovering the stories that are possible indirect experience in

224
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:11,119
really seeing clearly what's here and one of those stories is the stories of freedom

225
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,880
the stories of moving from suffering to the freedom from suffering

226
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,920
the story of happiness and and

227
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,760
living a clear life clarity and release

228
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,520
and that's a story that's worth living and maybe we can share that story with

229
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:40,078
each other stories of what we discover uh for in being free

230
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:47,839
so thank you and um and uh i hope you have a those of you in

231
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:53,040
the united states i hope you have a wonderful three-day weekend i'll be back

232
00:42:53,040 --> 00:43:00,240
here monday as usual even though it's a holiday and uh some of you might be away

233
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,520
and so i wish you well and in the meantime

234
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:11,599
you might over this weekend look a little bit about the role that uh

235
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:17,440
views stories opinions have in for you personally and see if you can discern the

236
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,760
difference between the views stories interpretations that you're caught in

237
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,040
and those that you're not caught in those which are helpful

238
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:38,000
to see more deeply into our direct experience with ourselves and other people and those stories that obscure

239
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,960
a real insight into what's happening here and now so thank you
