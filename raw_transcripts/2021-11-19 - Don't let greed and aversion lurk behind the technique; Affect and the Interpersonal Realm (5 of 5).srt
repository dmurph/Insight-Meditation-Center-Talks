1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,800
so good morning it's good to uh good to be with you just

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,280
watching the uh the chat on the side of my screen

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,439
yeah welcome welcome to you all

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,039
so um

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,718
generally i've practiced in a very technique oriented way

6
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,520
and that's been

7
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:56,840
of profound benefit and uh lean on meditation technique often

8
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:05,119
and and strikes me that that sometimes

9
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:12,000
the urge to reach for technique means that greed or aversion has already

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,040
taken hold yeah in the background

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,720
the urge to find technique sometimes is an expression

12
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:32,159
of our reticence to meet

13
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,320
the clinging already present

14
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,479
now sometimes technique is the best way of meeting it but

15
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:53,280
we want to be a little wary i feel

16
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,479
about using technique to defend against the

17
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,240
wildness of our heart and mind

18
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,520
and so i just plant this this seed as how i will proceed to

19
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,680
teach technique but i plant this seed so that we have some some

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,720
appreciation of the the subtleties of the movement towards technique yeah

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,440
and um

22
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,959
are careful in a way not to recapitulate

23
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,920
the the clinging in our practice yeah

24
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,680
a little subtle but uh just to consider

25
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,760
so um let's uh let's practice

26
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,160
just all at once the awareness can arrive

27
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:07,160
just affirming your aspirations for practice

28
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,840
summoning some measure of courage actually

29
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,638
it takes a lot of courage

30
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,840
to truly meet the intensity of the human condition

31
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,880
bringing attention to the sensations of

32
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:50,319
of breathing wherever they're [Music] felt most clearly

33
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:06,120
wherever that is just rest the attention and simple way there

34
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,000
feeling the uh

35
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,760
some precision when the inhale begins

36
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,760
and

37
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,880
when the exhale begins and ends

38
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:26,320
the attentional spotlight on your breathing becomes

39
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,560
steadier and brighter

40
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:45,079
as we settle there's less and less light that escapes

41
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,920
to other phenomena

42
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,200
the breath is illuminated

43
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,120
and everything else is enveloped in darkness

44
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,160
but that's not how it usually is

45
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,839
the throb of worry and concern

46
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,519
of preoccupation and strategizing

47
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,600
all of this wants to share the attentional light

48
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,519
our thinking

49
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,040
is the kind of top

50
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,440
layer of the top geological stratum

51
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:05,480
but beneath it is affect feeling

52
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,639
the body under conditions of threat

53
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,079
opportunity

54
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,519
and so when the attention moves away

55
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,040
when that light begins to uh leak

56
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,839
away from the sensations of breathing

57
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,000
to see if you can make a perfect piece

58
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,360
with affect with feeling

59
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,720
in some ways the the breath attending to the breathing

60
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:44,640
this gentle precise way it it's shelter from

61
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:54,720
the storm but in order to feel like shelter we

62
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,919
need to have made peace with the storm

63
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:17,919
to attend to the breathing is to release the grip

64
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,520
on the rest of phenomena

65
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,840
to put down covetousness and displeasure with

66
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,799
respect to the world

67
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,080
so thank you it's good to uh

68
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,919
good to see with you

69
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,039
so we'll continue continue with our theme for the week

70
00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:02,840
a group of um [Music] prominent emotion scientists neuroscientists wrote

71
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:10,000
a wrote a piece recently in a in a journal prominent journal and

72
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,519
um where titled the the rise of affectivism

73
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:22,000
affect rise of effectivism and what they said was

74
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,320
there was behaviorism which was uh oriented around

75
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,840
conditioning and reinforcement reward punishment

76
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:41,360
and then a cognitive phase you know where a lot of the attention was around

77
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:48,480
around memory and attention and perception and now they suggest maybe we're in a

78
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,760
phase in this cognitive science realm of effectiveness

79
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,159
valence emotion empathy mood motivation stress

80
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,600
well-being so the they write um

81
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:14,000
the behavioral and cognitive sciences have faced perennial challenges of incorporating emotions feelings

82
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,960
motivations moods and other affective processes into models of human behavior in the human

83
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,640
mind such processes have long been marginalized or ignored typically on the

84
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:33,200
basis that they were irrational unmeasurable or simply unenlightening

85
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:40,480
however it's become increasingly difficult to deny that these processes are not only linked to well-being

86
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,159
but also shape our behavior and drive key cognitive mechanisms such

87
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:52,480
as attention learning memory decision making

88
00:32:52,480 --> 00:33:00,480
emotions do not just shape how we interpret the world but also shape which aspects of the world need our attention

89
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:08,640
and which can be safely ignored emotions are not just about what is

90
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,279
but also about what matters

91
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:24,278
so so much hinges on feeling

92
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:30,480
so much hinges on feeling and in this interpersonal

93
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,080
world you know the interpersonal realm that that's been our focus

94
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:43,760
uh it's so vital that we become deeply acquainted

95
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:51,039
there are there are of course thoughts and perception and sights and sounds and

96
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,799
tastes and other sensations but um

97
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:03,679
feeling is the linchpin arjun tsujita says um

98
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:09,599
all dhammas converge on feeling

99
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,599
all dhammas all in this context all phenomena converge

100
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,720
on feeling and

101
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:28,800
experience largely becomes meaningful because of feeling

102
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,320
experience becomes meaningful because of feeling

103
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:43,280
motivation depends on feeling the sense of urgency

104
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,760
depends on feeling and each feeling state

105
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,560
announces a kind of command

106
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:03,200
do something say something think something

107
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:10,240
and so we have to develop a kind of wise clear loving

108
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:19,280
relationship with our feeling life and this is nowhere is this more apparent than in

109
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:27,039
enjoying and navigating the you know interpersonal realm

110
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:35,839
so uh evolutionary uh psychiatrist niece says um

111
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:42,720
emotions are specialized modes of operation shaped by natural selection

112
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,680
to adjust the physiological psychological and behavioral parameters

113
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:56,320
in ways that increase our capacity and tendency to respond adaptively to

114
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,839
threats and opportunities

115
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,280
and there are there are always threats and opportunities being with others

116
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,480
entails some threat and opportunity

117
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,000
remember that line we started with from lisa feldman barrett that the the best thing for a human nervous

118
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
system is another human and the worst thing for a human nervous system is another human

119
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,400
we are navigating subtle or more demonstrable

120
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:41,838
threat and opportunity and

121
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,920
this means that our feeling life is very prominent yeah in the

122
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:54,800
interpersonal realm and while emotion is

123
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,880
designed for uh to promote evolutionary fitness that's very different from saying that

124
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:09,200
it's designed for enlightenment there are some things that yeah we flow

125
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,079
with the stream of our own biological conditioning and other things we go against the

126
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:23,280
stream and so we uh

127
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:29,760
we need deep emotional wisdom for to tolerate

128
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,800
the dependence of love the surrender

129
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,480
that i was speaking about yesterday the

130
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,720
the increasing riskiness of entrusting our heart to

131
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,839
another can

132
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,119
torque our mind in a lot of different ways

133
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:06,160
to open our heart to another entails a willingness and

134
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:13,280
courage to to grieve all that is precious and dear to me is

135
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,240
of the nature to change

136
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:26,560
colleague um gisele jones uh defines intimacy as

137
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:33,680
the ability and willingness to see and be seen the ability and willingness to see and

138
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,720
be seen and

139
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,400
we need profound emotional skill to be

140
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,480
undisguised in our strength and our poverty

141
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:04,720
wisdom [Music] and equanimity is uh required to fully enjoy pleasure

142
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,040
not to pinch our pleasure because it feels wild

143
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,800
or exposed or somehow

144
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,000
cuts against our notion of restraint

145
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:30,160
we we often often talk about equanimity with craving

146
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,000
and that's one thing that's vital but what is

147
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,839
equanimity with pleasure itself

148
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:49,680
it does not mean to squash it it does not mean to not enjoy it and it does not

149
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:56,119
mean to be worried about getting attached

150
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,640
what what how do we bring this kind of

151
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,920
skill with feeling so as not to

152
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,799
suppress or get entangled

153
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:21,359
we need wisdom to navigate the the inevitable

154
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:29,119
challenges and frustrations and disappointments the cycles of um

155
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,530
of idealization of disillusionment of reconnecting to some

156
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:40,560
[Music] uh warmth

157
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:48,560
the tolerance of ambivalence ambivalence this kind of uh

158
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:56,720
one way of thinking about dukkha about suffering is uh it's about ambivalence

159
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:04,160
we need emotional skill to um

160
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,319
to recognize that the other

161
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:17,400
can never be [Music] the end of your seeking

162
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,400
other people in our lives can do so much some things that

163
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,560
only another can do and and

164
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:39,440
uh the other cannot be the end of seeking

165
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,240
wanting in other words is always different from getting

166
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:56,880
we need emotional skill to be wrong there's so much so much shame about

167
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,359
being wrong and we're wrong so much

168
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,440
sometimes you maybe you know those moments you you kind of know you're wrong maybe you're having a

169
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,359
conversation with somebody important to you and um

170
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:22,720
and there's like that that subtle little voice of just like yeah i kind of

171
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:28,000
know i'm wrong right but the prospect of the shame of of kind

172
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,200
of acknowledging it is just too much so we like double down you know even though we know

173
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,800
we're bluffing right just dig in

174
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,160
i was always inspired by something sylvia borstein said when she said like you know when i realize i'm wrong like

175
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:54,079
i'll just like pull up right out of the moment just mid-sentence and just say

176
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,680
yeah i'm wrong i'm sorry this doesn't feel right

177
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:06,319
you know it's like you can feel that you're about to like re-double dig back into your emotional

178
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:13,838
stance and like the courage of just like mid-sentence you know

179
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,480
so wait a second take skill yeah

180
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:28,160
skill emotional skill we need skill uh

181
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,599
amidst all of these realms of feeling

182
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,880
interpersonal realm

183
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,680
sergeant uh if it's properly cultivated the body

184
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:51,280
can provide a mooring post it's the ground the stabilizer

185
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:57,760
it knows how to discharge energy all that push of the mind sends a lot of

186
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,839
energy into the system sometimes you can get quite heated or feel very

187
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:11,680
heavy tense tight disoriented that's what's happening

188
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:18,480
uh what's happening is all that that veina and sankaras are

189
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:26,079
pushing and driving churning up energy the body knows how to discharge the mind

190
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:33,119
doesn't not by itself this is how you allow the discharge to happen

191
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,560
relax open the palms of the hands open the

192
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,680
soles of the feet relax the jaw

193
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:51,599
open the temples of the head sockets of the eyes and the forehead

194
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:58,000
drop your shoulders loosen your belly breathing out

195
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
releasing you begin to see that those mental

196
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:12,799
emotional psychological patterns have a body correlative correlation

197
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:19,119
and you work on their bodily aspect

198
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,800
it may not give you clear solutions as to why you feel this way what you're going

199
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,560
to do with the rest of your life how you're going to sort out this person

200
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:37,280
and so forth but it will tell you how to stop suffering

201
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,440
so as we develop

202
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,839
more wisdom patience equanimity around feeling

203
00:45:53,839 --> 00:46:01,920
this is uh also deepens our empathic capacity

204
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,920
that when we resolve bring a higher resolution to our inner

205
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,680
life our inner feeling life

206
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:20,078
we can perceive in much richer detail the inner life of others

207
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:25,440
and this of course is helpful too
