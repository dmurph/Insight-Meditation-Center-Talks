1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,319
okay so why don't we go ahead and get started welcome

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,799
to the monday evening sid and dharma talk with the insight meditation center i'm

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:19,119
kim allen and i'm delighted to be here with you this evening

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:26,640
so why don't we go ahead and get started with the sit so finding a posture that's

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,079
upright also relaxed

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,920
sitting in position sitting posture so you can feel your seat against the

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,879
chair or the cushion or the bench and your legs or your feet against the

8
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,800
floor so there's a sense of the stable foundation

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,040
on which you're resting really feeling the stability of where

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,759
you're sitting and if you're comfortable doing so you

11
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:24,479
can close your eyes just gently allowing the eyes to close

12
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:33,360
so that the attention comes inward you're feeling the body from the inside

13
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,240
perhaps on the next out breath softening any

14
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,200
obvious areas of tension you can also shift your body back and forth a little

15
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,799
bit or forward and back to find

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,439
a central point where you feel like you're balanced

17
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:14,000
on the place where you're sitting so there's not very much effort to hold

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,840
yourself vertical if you're sitting vertically

19
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,959
and then it can be helpful at the beginning of a sit to just consciously

20
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:40,080
go through the body and inviting ease and softening

21
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:48,080
what can be softened especially at the end of the day when we may be carrying some tensions

22
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,120
from our activities of the day from what we needed to do to to get

23
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:04,080
here to the sit so softening the muscles of the face

24
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,599
the forehead around the eyes the jaw

25
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:19,840
just letting the expression on the face be soft and easeful

26
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,360
softening the eyes and the eye sockets they tend to get a little tight when

27
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,840
we've been looking at the computer screen

28
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,720
even releasing any tension from inside the head

29
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:56,400
maybe right behind the eyes from focusing the mind thinking

30
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,560
just allowing that to release if it will just inviting that

31
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,639
down the neck into the shoulder area

32
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:28,400
softening the shoulder joints letting the shoulders naturally drop

33
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,040
so the shoulder blades slide down the

34
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
back

35
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:56,080
relaxing down the arms and hands

36
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:03,199
and down into the chest area the heart lungs front back

37
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:10,240
sides of the ribcage

38
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,899
releasing the diaphragm [Music]

39
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,639
and all down through the belly area just letting go of any obvious tension

40
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,880
there

41
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,240
and i like to simultaneously invite some ease in the muscles of the low back

42
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,280
so that it's if what's on both sides of the spine is falling away to the front and to the

43
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,840
back

44
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:09,759
down into the hip joints softening a little further into the seat

45
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,600
and down into the legs releasing any bracing

46
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:25,120
softening the knee joints ankle joints all the way to the feet

47
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:39,600
so we've invited ease throughout the whole body i'm just returning attention to the

48
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,360
sense of sitting the whole body

49
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
sitting

50
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,669
and orienting our mind toward meditation [Music]

51
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:17,840
intending to stay present

52
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:27,120
not with the idea that it will be 100 mindfulness

53
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:45,840
or just carrying the interest the intention of being with our experience

54
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:59,599
allowing the mind to gently rest on the sensations of breathing

55
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:06,720
it may be that we've done breath meditation a lot or

56
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:16,479
feel like we must by now know everything about our breath

57
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:30,800
but i'd like to encourage a sense of freshness newness

58
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,959
every breath is unique what would it be like to sit with the

59
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,479
breath and not know already what the breath is like

60
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:55,839
bringing some curiosity and openness

61
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:48,240
as we settle in further it can be helpful to notice

62
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,279
something about how the mind is now

63
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,880
is it generally a little dull tired

64
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:09,440
the end of the day or is a bit restless and agitated

65
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,279
is there a dominant mood or emotion going on in the mind or the heart right

66
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:29,839
now just to know what that is

67
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,800
i'm bringing that same sense of freshness

68
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:45,040
to our mind and heart we may have felt tired many times

69
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,000
or we may have felt sadness

70
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:59,360
or even joy many times but what about this time

71
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:08,399
i'm going to sing again [Music] noticing afresh how the mind is

72
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:25,839
curious if it might be slightly different than we felt before

73
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
now

74
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:15,280
as you keep sitting if you begin to feel any sense of

75
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:24,880
ease or peace stillness even just a little bit

76
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:33,840
it's fine to turn toward that with even some curiosity

77
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:41,360
what is this stillness like this ease

78
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,679
opening to it gently so as not to disturb it

79
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:58,840
but that too can be seen [Music] with fresh eyes as if we haven't felt it

80
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,840
before

81
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:24,960
when we sit with the body and mind in this way with a sense of

82
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:33,840
seeing what is new or treating it as something open and fresh

83
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:43,760
there's a remarkable feeling of friendliness that can come a sense that we are

84
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,799
making friends with the body and the mind

85
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,080
more so than if we just treated it as the same old thing

86
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,840
that we've sat and meditated with for a long time

87
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,840
somehow that freshness and openness

88
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:17,120
creates a kind of intimacy it feels like having a good friend

89
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:29,840
in the zen tradition it said not knowing is most intimate

90
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:47,279
so if it feels right you can smile a bit at your friend body and mind as they are

91
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:57,840
at this moment i'm just resting for a few more minutes

92
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
b

93
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:01,600
and as we come into the last minutes of this sit

94
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:11,840
perhaps reflecting if there's anything new that you saw in your

95
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:19,279
that you hadn't really been aware of before just by having this idea of freshness or

96
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:24,640
newness did you see anything that you hadn't

97
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:31,600
seen before doesn't have to be major just any little

98
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
thing

99
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,320
you
