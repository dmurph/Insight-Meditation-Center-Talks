8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,559
a helping to teach a our IMC teacher training program we have 15 people that

9
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:58,680
we're training to become next generation of teachers and

10
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,879
uh and and um delighted to be able to be back

11
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:10,840
here um two of those are Liz Powell and and Cotto conin who taught for the last

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,119
two weeks and delighted that they could be here at 700 a.m. and teach with you

13
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,640
while I had a vacation and um I'm very happy to be back here and to be with you at the

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,799
beginning of the year

15
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:35,320
the uh the the plan for the next five weeks that I'm here I think there's a there's

16
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:43,600
a one week I'm away but for those the the weeks that I'm here is to offer um

17
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,640
the basic teachings that we teach at IMC the basic teachings that I teach when I teach mindfulness meditation at an intro

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,719
to meditation class or somewhat the structure the format used for

19
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:03,119
Retreats and uh and but to do it uh uh

20
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:11,520
uh there's five areas uh breath body emotions thoughts and then life itself

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:19,800
the rest of it and uh and I want to spend a week on each area to be able to go into some depth and some nuance and

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,599
some application of these five important areas and so what we'll do is like this

23
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:32,480
week we'll be breathing and um and each day we'll go a little bit further uh in

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:40,080
with this topic of mindfulness of breathing and and uh and uh and then we'll do

25
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,519
repeat the same for the body so um to begin with the most basic

26
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,879
way of doing meditation which is relevant for people

27
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,879
who are new and relevant people who are very experienced and uh I think the more

28
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:06,200
experienced we are the more useful it is to return to Basics and the more experienced we are

29
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,360
more more we appreciate the Simplicity of the basics aspect of meditation that

30
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,480
we're not looking for fireworks we're not looking

31
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:24,200
for something very special beyond the specialness of being fully present for

32
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:31,360
life as it comes to us to be present for as it is and uh and Delight or

33
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,840
appreciate deeply our capacity to be conscious to be aware of what's happening and and

34
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,360
find a refuge in that awareness and so the most simple way of

35
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,840
understanding or I I propose today a very simple way of understanding the beginning of

36
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:59,799
meditation is uh to become aware of how distracted you are to become aware of um how your we

37
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:06,239
not in the present moment that we lose our sense of kind of poignant awareness

38
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,040
of the present we lose touch with the fact that it's special very special kind

39
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:19,280
of a a marvelous thing a Marvel to be conscious even what is it how did the

40
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,400
universe arise so that the Universe could be conscious of itself in this way

41
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,919
that is through through us and um so the for I'd like to offer

42
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:36,080
then would meditate one that I like very much to use is that of

43
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,680
a um of a very clear Mountain

44
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,919
Creek and uh you're sitting on the edge of the creek and this is based on

45
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:55,000
experience I had up in the mountains not far from here and uh and

46
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,600
um not being able to tell whether the water is Flowing or not it's very clear

47
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:08,639
seemed very very still and so I took a stick and put it into the water um

48
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:15,840
vertically and then I could see that there was a little current um little wavelets that were formed on the edge of

49
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:23,039
the of the of the stick and so I saw oh there's a current water is in fact moving and sometimes it's difficult to

50
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:30,240
see that our mind is moving a lot it's distracted and CAU what it's caught up in because we're so caught up in it

51
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,880
um we're too distracted we're distracted from our distractions by our

52
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:43,199
distractions and um and so something as simple as returning to the breath returning to the body here in the

53
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,080
present moment um what rather than thinking you have to be successful at

54
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,440
staying with a breath staying present with the body every time we

55
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,319
return and stay with the breathing for just a little while uh if it

56
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,160
highlights how you're distracted how the mind is wandering off that's

57
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,840
successful that's a good moment to say oh that's how I'm that's what I'm concerned with that's what I'm caught up

58
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:19,240
in oh this is a busy mind this is a distracted mind this is a preoccupation

59
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:26,599
with my feelings and what's going on this is what's taking me away from this

60
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:33,080
moment being present conscious here this is how I lose touch with the miracle of

61
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:39,960
mindfulness the miracle of awareness so

62
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,639
um so um some people are saying the sound

63
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:56,319
is low it could well be I'm using the the the um I'm using

64
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,400
the the mic on the laptop maybe if I come a little bit closer maybe and I'll

65
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,440
try maybe I'll try speaking a little louder um maybe my voice is particularly

66
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:19,000
soft when I'm at The Retreat Center so to assume a meditation

67
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:26,680
posture and um and it's a posture that is

68
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,759
to um Express an

69
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,520
interest a dedication to being present to really

70
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:48,199
being here and if we take a posture that is sometimes too relaxed to you know n no

71
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:54,360
muscles could be are being used to be present then there's less support from

72
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,800
the body to be really be here it's fine to be laying down if

73
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,639
that's what how you meditate but even then it might be possible to uh have one

74
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,560
one or both arms uh maybe the elbows on the side but the forearms pointing to

75
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:21,319
the ceiling so there's kind of a um intentionality to be here a kind of a

76
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,599
physical participation and yes here I

77
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:33,760
am for those sitting in a chair to uh if it's Works to sit up a little

78
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:41,839
straighter so that the spine or the chest belly the head are a little bit

79
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,000
Express are expressing this capacity to be

80
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,839
present supporting our ability to

81
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:00,560
notice when we become distracted when we get it's pulled into

82
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,160
the world of thoughts or feelings so we're no longer

83
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:14,720
aware of now to lower your

84
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,760
gaze and if it's comfortable to close your

85
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,360
eyes and to spend a few moments preparing yourself for the

86
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:43,320
meditation by taking a few deeper breaths just deep enough that it stays

87
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,079
comfortable for

88
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,839
you and a long

89
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:06,240
exhale deep deeper breaths Fuller breaths slower

90
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,360
breaths can be a way that helps our muscles in the body to

91
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,079
relax slow little deeper

92
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:30,320
breaths seems to function as a reassurance to for our nervous system

93
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,880
things are okay for these

94
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,200
minutes and as you

95
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,399
exhale to relax your

96
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:05,200
body and then to let your breathing return to

97
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:16,360
normal or almost normal it might be nice to let your breathing continue to be a

98
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,160
little slower a little longer

99
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:30,959
deeper and as you do so to relax your body

100
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
me

101
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:25,279
and then settling into your body to become aware of the body's

102
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,760
experience of breathing some people will feel the breathing in

103
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,839
their chest as a chest Moves In and Out expands and

104
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:44,279
contracts some people feel their breathing the body breathing in the

105
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,600
belly the expansion and contraction of the

106
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:57,360
belly some people feel body breathing with the air going in and out through the

107
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
nostrils

108
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,360
and some people feel all of that kind of a global

109
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,959
experience of

110
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,760
breathing and then

111
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,600
not so much trying to stay with your

112
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:51,399
breathing but rather to have the connection to

113
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:57,399
breathing highlight for you when you lose that

114
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:05,399
connection when you you get pulled into distractions or thoughts

115
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,680
preoccupations and rather than drifting off in those thoughts and

116
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,920
preoccupations no clearly no this is what's happening oh here is a

117
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,680
mind that's thinking that's preoccupied that has

118
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:32,639
concerns and if you have that kind of clarity you're not really

119
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,480
preoccupied you're present you know what's

120
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:43,040
happening and then Begin Again with your

121
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:51,000
breathing over and over again return to your

122
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,680
breathing and notice when you lose touch with

123
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,959
that when you're pre preoccupied or swept in up in your thoughts and

124
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,560
concerns again may be

125
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:16,160
delighted that you can see this you can know this for some of you maybe it's kind of

126
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:25,000
fun to do it like a little game noticing it's best you

127
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:30,600
can where the mind is like a

128
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,880
little kid toddler who's playing hide and go

129
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,639
seek the mind is kind of running off by itself so that you don't notice that

130
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,920
you're thinking don't notice what you're caught up

131
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,240
in and you're delighted to say hi I see

132
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,600
you and then Begin Again with your breath

133
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
breathing

134
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

135
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
for

136
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
for

137
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
for

138
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

139
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

140
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

141
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:20,400
for this meditation there's no need to be frustrated with not staying on your

142
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:29,559
breathing the function of breathing is to mindfulness of breathing is to help you become clearer

143
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:36,320
more observant of when you're not with your

144
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:47,159
breath and what is it that takes you away to clearly see

145
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:53,679
that almost like you're taking a backward step and looking back oh this is a thinking

146
00:20:53,679 --> 00:21:00,200
mind this is preoccupation this is being pulled into

147
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:07,400
the world of emotions this is what takes me away

148
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:15,640
from being present for this moment as it

149
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
is

150
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

151
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

152
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

153
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,320
if you know you are distracted you're not really distracted

154
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:22,440
anymore you simply know you recognize the forces of

155
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:30,720
distraction that are operating in you without being lost in

156
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
them

157
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

158
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

159
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
for

160
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

161
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:20,440
and then as we come to the end of this

162
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:30,398
sitting to appreciate or recognize that

163
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:38,679
the more meaningful or more direct or connected ways we have of being with

164
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:46,200
other people requires us to be present with

165
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,320
them the more distracted we are the more we're caught up in our own

166
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,600
thoughts concerns the less friend active

167
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,679
friendliness care love

168
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:09,080
kindness respect attention do we have for

169
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,799
others to become be able to recognize when we're

170
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:24,200
distracted to be wise about

171
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:33,600
it to not be distracted by our

172
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,720
distractions but to be able to switch

173
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:51,278
gears to offer our presence our attention here and

174
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:59,518
now so we can feel and appreciate the full Humanity of someone else

175
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,840
else and in so

176
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:16,039
doing to better be able to be friendly kind

177
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:20,360
respectful well wishing for

178
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:29,440
others and one of the very important aspect of Buddhist spirituality

179
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,799
is to awaken our good

180
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:42,559
will for others people animals for life

181
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,799
itself may all beings be

182
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:59,398
happy may all beings be safe

183
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:05,480
may all beings be

184
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,919
peaceful may all beings be

185
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:18,120
free and may our ability to be present for

186
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:25,840
others with our Attention our kindness May that contribute to the

187
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,080
welfare and happiness of

188
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:39,360
everyone thank you very much I'm bowing to all of you I don't have a bell here

189
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:47,000
to Ring to end the sitting so um this is now the

190
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
end

191
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:49,159
so again hello and with this talk I begin now a week

192
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:56,679
on um mindfulness of breathing as part of a five week series on introducing the

193
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:03,799
basic elements of mindfulness meditation as taught at IMC inside meditation

194
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:10,679
center and um I'm hoping that to spend five days on

195
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:17,720
each of these five topics of these weeks breathing body emotions thinking and

196
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,960
then bringing the practice into our life that uh over the five days we're laying

197
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,080
down a foundation and moving into a fuller experience of it that uh maybe it

198
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,159
will be appreciated by people who are well experienced in practice as well and

199
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:40,559
for those of you whove had instructions basic instructions in mindfulness before I hope that it's a

200
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:46,200
little bit different um what I have to offer so so it has a little different

201
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,720
perspective um and maybe it goes a little bit further about the potentiality of this wonderful practice

202
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:58,720
that we do so um so we're here to prac practice

203
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,760
mindfulness and um the synonym I use for mindfulness is

204
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,600
awareness and um but in kind of developing a lucid awareness or a

205
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,159
Clarity of awareness that we're we're really present for our experience and

206
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:20,200
we're knowing it we're feeling it seeing it we're really there with the

207
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:26,200
experience in a way that it feels a little bit like a miracle which is uh maybe it's not a

208
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:33,760
miracle exactly who knows what a miracle is but what a Marvel what a special thing to be conscious to be

209
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:41,200
aware and um and just to really feel that awareness to feel that to know that

210
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:49,919
we're here and present I mean this is we're not going to be around and alive for that long and this is the special

211
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,799
time that uh for us to be conscious to be aware to be present the spark of life

212
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:02,159
is spark of Consciousness that will soon soon enough pass and someone else will

213
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,760
have it um there's been many people over the thousands of years who had their

214
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,799
time to be present now we have our time and to use that

215
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:19,039
well uh to discover the miracle of being really

216
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:28,880
aware the the potentiality of it and how it leads us to both a freedom and

217
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,440
a in a catalyst evoking for the emergence of really beautiful potential

218
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:42,519
that we have that comes from with freedom so it starts very simple the

219
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:48,480
instructions and mindfulness and I would like to suggest that it starts first and

220
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,760
foremost by just becoming aware that we're not aware that we're

221
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:01,760
distracted to recognize clear clearly that we are distracted when we are distracted and

222
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:09,040
when we sit down to meditate uh the basic kind of instructions is to meditate with

223
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:15,720
breathing um be mindful of your breathing um but rather than thinking that you're supposed to stay focused in

224
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:22,480
the breath and that that something you're doing something wrong if your mind loses touch with breathing uh some

225
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,839
people can barely be aware of one full breath before the mind wanders off

226
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:34,480
um and then they get upset that the mind wanders off and they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing the

227
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:42,358
beginning instructions is not is to use the breathing as a basis or Foundation but

228
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:49,280
not to be undistracted but rather to have the breathing help you see how distracted

229
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,398
you are and sometimes what we discover when we sit down to meditate is that the

230
00:34:55,399 --> 00:35:03,200
mind is a hurricane the mind is a is a um kind of waterfall cascading of

231
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:10,000
thoughts or a fountain spewing out things or just a chaos

232
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,400
something and uh and rather than thinking that then you're not meditating or doing it wrong for mindfulness

233
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,520
meditation that's a fantast that's the first Insight that we many people

234
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,000
discover the mind is out of control wow this is the wow the mind has a mind of

235
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,400
its own it's just thinking and and uh and fantasizing and remembering and

236
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:41,240
planning and arguing and complaining and wow it's doing all this stuff and that

237
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:47,960
wow that's see oh that's what's happening that's the moment we're not

238
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,839
distracted to know that we're distracted paradoxically is at that

239
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:00,480
moment we're not because we know what's going on and um and and then we're doing

240
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,400
the mindfulness practice so this is a very important point because if you don't understand

241
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,319
this point and think the point is to stay focused and continuous with the breathing and then get upset when you're

242
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:19,800
distracted then you're just agitating yourself some more you're just being even more distracted by the

243
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,960
upset but to not be upset by a distracted mind is part of the training

244
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,319
of mindfulness to learn learn how not to be activated or

245
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:36,119
reactivated by uh our likes and dislikes what we think should be happening and not

246
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:41,440
happening how we judge ourselves for what's happening but simply to learn the

247
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,119
art of clearly seeing clearly recognizing oh that's what's

248
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,440
happening so to take a meditation posture that gives you some

249
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:58,520
stability so the posture itself expresses a sense of being really

250
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:05,319
present I'm inspired by little children maybe children who can't even walk yet

251
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:12,960
and um maybe still in their diapers I've seen sometimes we know where they have a bare chest a bare torso there's no

252
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,560
clothes in a warm day or something and how they can sit upright on the floor

253
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,760
and that the uprightness of those spines is so beautiful to

254
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:30,480
see the alertness the presence and their bodies are completely kind of relaxed

255
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,000
they're too young to carry a lot of tension sometimes but the beauty of just kind of alertness of the body taking a

256
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,599
posture it's clear that they're attentive and present or like a dog standing at attention in a relaxed way

257
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:49,000
but it's clear the dog is you know really attend attending so the idea is

258
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,599
to kind of find a posture that can be relaxed uh not tense if there's a lot of

259
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,560
tension then want to emphasize a relaxing posture but sooner or later

260
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:10,800
it's not only about relaxing it's also about uh kind of a a um sense of strong

261
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,079
attentiveness or a alert attentiveness like with through the

262
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:27,480
body so take some care with the posture and uh the U and then um

263
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:34,599
and then relax soften and take some deep breaths both

264
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:39,800
to help you relax further but also to begin becoming familiar with what

265
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:48,160
breathing is like let the breathing then after a while return to normal and then

266
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:54,760
notice how you're distracted notice how the mind wanders off notice the

267
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,839
preoccupations and once you have a Clarity of knowing that

268
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:05,800
without ideally without judgment if you're judging it that's just one more distraction that you can

269
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,880
be aware of oh judging judging thinking just seeing clearly

270
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,720
what's going on the tricks of the mind and how you get pulled away from the present moment in

271
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:25,200
it and uh or or pulled pulled away from it or you know into other times and

272
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:31,960
places or see how you're so judging or so reactive to what's happening at the present moment that the quality of

273
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:37,119
attention is not fully present it's kind of now being through a filter of

274
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:44,480
reactivity and pulling away or wanting something different and um and the idea is we're

275
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,560
starting to become familiar with all the ways in which we

276
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:57,040
are not fully present without judgment about it without criticism about it

277
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:04,079
and learning to appreciate that that is a moment of attention that's a moment of mindfulness

278
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:10,000
to see how we're distracted and in after a few moments of

279
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,359
that Clarity and Rec oh boy I'm really spending a lot of time planning my day

280
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:21,800
this is planning my day or I'm reviewing that conversation yesterday and

281
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:28,200
complaining or coming up with a better response than I did or I'm just living in my regrets reviewing over and over

282
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:36,400
again the terrible things I did that's what's happening um so instead of oh that's is

283
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,560
terrible I'm a terrible person or or without just justifying I need to plan

284
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:48,000
I'm supposed to plan and come up with all the all the different reasons why you're supposed to be doing it the idea

285
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,800
is to is to find that place where we can very matter of factly Simply directly

286
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,079
know I'm distracted raed uh I'm caught up this is how I'm

287
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:07,040
caught up we're starting to become familiar with the tricks of the Mind how the mind takes us away from a

288
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:13,720
qualitatively rich way of being present here and now so do that for a few moments and

289
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:20,000
then come back to the breathing and at this point in the practice this very beginning point the function of the

290
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,960
breathing is not something to stay focused on that's certainly nice if you can do it but rather to help you see

291
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,359
clearly how much you're wandering off you have a reference

292
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:38,960
point to see the movements of the mind um and if we don't have a reference

293
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:46,079
point then it's too easy to be pulled into the currents of the mind and not even know that we're being pulled down

294
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:52,599
the river of the mind um because we're so in it but we have a reference point

295
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:58,400
so imagine it's kind of like you're in the you don't even know you're floating in Cur into the river but you grab onto

296
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,920
a branch from a tree over overhanging the river and um and you're you're held

297
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,800
there for a few minutes and you're not being pulled along in the current anymore and then you feel the strength

298
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:15,760
of the current wow it's a strong current or no today it's this area it's a weak

299
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,559
current and then you let go and you're in the current for a while don't even know you're in it until another Branch

300
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:27,000
comes along and so so the branch for in

301
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,160
in mindfulness meditation is breathing and we hold on and we see more

302
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,280
clearly what's happening and and then we do it again and again seeing how our

303
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:45,880
mind is distracted and this way distraction is not proof that you're meditating wrong

304
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:52,720
distraction seeing distraction is how you know you're meditating oh this is how this is what's happening this is

305
00:42:52,720 --> 00:43:00,920
what's oh now I see this is what's happening and um so

306
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,280
um so for and then over the next days we'll

307
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:12,920
talk more and we'll talk more also about you know getting focused on breathing and staying more continuous with it but

308
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:19,720
this exercise lays the foundation for our ability to do that in a in a productive useful

309
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:25,079
way so um

310
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:32,559
so if you'd like the homework you could do is to do this in your daily life as well

311
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:39,440
not just in meditation become aware of how you are um distracted in everyday

312
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:46,960
life how you get pulled into your thoughts and preoccupations so the the attention is not qualitatively rich for

313
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:54,079
being fully present here for what's happening with a conversation you have with another person for the activity of

314
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:59,839
in the kitchen that you're doing or cleaning or driving or whatever you're doing start

315
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:07,359
noticing um how you are uh the tricks of the

316
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:17,720
mind so um thank you and uh tomorrow I will um be back at IMC and so

317
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:24,800

318
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,400
open room we use for walk meditation and I don't have the the microphone on and

319
