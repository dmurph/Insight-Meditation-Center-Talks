00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:14,480

later in time lovely to feel your presence to join the

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,039
sangha so nice just so lovely i've already my heart is already warmed up

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,080
with the hellos that um even though it seems like we're just

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,239
saying hello but it's it's an expression of human kindness that we show up

7
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:43,200
we show up and we say hello we say hello we say hi maybe we smile maybe we wave

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,760
human kindness everywhere just showing up with our heart

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:58,800
so see the theme for tonight is hello human kindness hello human kindness

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,720
it's actually um i'm borrowing this phrase from

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,520
a health network that's local here in california and i've seen their ads previously on various billboards and

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,759
buses and i thought huh how interesting hello human kindness and

13
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,240
and today just came up for me it came off for me hello human kindness ah

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,000
it's kindness is everywhere so if we say hello the same way that we show up and

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,159
we say hello and we get seen we get recognized we can we can also

16
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,920
recognize human kindness in so many places it's all around us it's within us

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,280
we can recognize them ourselves so

18
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,720
we often we often don't see it our minds focus on what's negative what people did wrong

19
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,479
what we did wrong and all the um ill will

20
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,840
not to say that yes wholesome intentions and then turning our minds towards the

21
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,560
wholesome always and and noticing what's unskillful is important and yet it is important to to

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,959
notice kindness so so let's do a little exercise

23
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,319
first look around wherever you're sitting look around the room where you are just take a look

24
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,920
okay now [Music] if i say

25
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,800
notice the color blue now look around

26
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,080
see where you see blue places you hadn't noticed before because

27
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,000
you were not looking for it ah there's more blue than i realized here look at that

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,959
a lot more blue

29
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,200
now what if i asked you to look to notice the color red

30
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,360
yeah ah it's actually kind of nice to notice

31
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,920
right to notice these colors these vibrant colors jumping out which i

32
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,840
hadn't noticed they're there before i do this with so many colors but the

33
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,360
point the point i want to make is it's here there there's so much in our field of

34
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,159
vision especially visually there's so much in our field of vision that we don't pick out for so our minds are

35
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,440
everywhere we don't we're not uh paying attention to colors but the

36
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,599
same way there's so much that we're thinking about and planning and and all

37
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:02,640
regretting that we don't tune we don't tune to human kindness we don't tune to

38
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,680
human kindness and it's all around us there's a vibrancy

39
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,720
it's like the vibrancy of these colors i'm going to choose red such a vibrant

40
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,880
color one of my favorite colors all around we won't notice the

41
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,520
vibrancy of human kindness so so the theme tonight is hello human

42
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:33,520
kindness both within ourselves outside inside tuning into it as if

43
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:42,800
we're tuning a radio maybe we don't hear it at all at first maybe we just had a really long hard day

44
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,680
and let's tune into the channel of human kindness ah letting our hearts be nourished

45
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,040
by this channel so that's the invitation for tonight and i'll give some guidance some

46
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,600
invitations and feel free to adapt them to

47
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:11,440
whatever works for you whatever is needed right now and um just one more thing to say for those who might be new

48
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,800
we always start with um [Music] settling landing the breath the body to

49
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,199
stabilize and calm the mind then then i open up to

50
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,320
the invitations so so without further ado

51
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,360
let's uh let's begin let's begin you need to shift or move your body

52
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,880
with kindness ask what this body needs in this moment

53
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,120
ah so that it can settle and be happy as happy as possible sitting for the next

54
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,000
30 minutes of meditation

55
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,120

can we say hello to the breath of the body again calming soothing this breath

77
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,200
as if this breath is a gift of kindness from the world

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,880
[Music] from the universe this oxygen

79

that keeps us alive

80
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,880
the right mix of oxygen and nitrogen

81
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,120
in breath

82
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,880

84
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,600
breath intertwined

85
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,760
with kind awareness

86
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
now i'd like to invite you if you would

87
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:23,680
as you stay embodied in the body with the breath feeling the breath in

88
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,880
the abdomen lowering the center of gravity

89
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:37,600
bring to your heart not to your head but to your heart space

90
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:46,800

91
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:55,760
and feel it in your heart space the kindness the goodness

92
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,839
the generosity of the act and not to think about it analyze it why

93
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,360
they did it or other motives no not

no feeling of obligation just receiving receiving

105
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,920
is the biggest gift we can give others is to receive their kindness

106
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:02,360
graciously practice gracious receiving in this moment

107
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,000
maybe the words or the feeling of appreciation gratitude

108
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,520
or thank you these words bubble up

109
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,159

112
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,559
and gently opening up your heart wider

113
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:24,919
maybe there's another act of kindness thought from this care

114
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,120
maybe a phone call a friend or family member

115
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:40,160
i thought about you hello humankind

116
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:46,520
letting your heart open to appreciating that now

117
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,559
and you can open up if you like to another act of kindness

118
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:34,400
maybe somebody is making time for you has made time for you

119
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,799
sharing their resources their skills

120
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,480
their presence

121
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,799
their care

122
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:05,840
hello kindness hello

123
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,840
hello

124
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,400
and you can open up your heart just

125
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,559
allowing these kindnesses these gifts to arise

126
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,480
not so much going out and searching for them but letting them come up if they do

127
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,080
and if not then staying with the last one just staying and relishing

128
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,760
appreciating this is not a thinking practice it's a feeling it's an opening the heart

129
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,520
and letting kindness goodness arise

130
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:23,440
and appreciating relishing as the visitors who come and knock on

131
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,000
your door you open the door you say hello hello kindness hello human

132
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,600
kindness you don't go out searching all over town because no need

133
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:43,600
i'm gonna knock on your door just hang out be relaxed and spacious

134
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,240
in your heart space

135
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,480
you see sit with these so many kindnesses not from

136
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,640
just yesterday or today or earlier the week but maybe earlier in your life

137
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:22,559
arise so many gifts of kindness hello human kindness

138
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,720
not to think about it again just rest

139
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,159
best to take it slow so the mind isn't jumping from one thought to the next

140
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,520
stay stay

141
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,960
for a while with weather rises

142
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,440
and now you can continue in this way

143
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:36,080
or let's turn around and allow yourself to relish

144
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,440
your own kindness

145
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,000
appreciating your own kindness

146
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:56,279
maybe we start with you to yourself

147
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:09,679
as if you're a beloved other maybe you're feeding yourself

148
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,000
something healthy wholesome

149
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,960
or resting when you need to rest

150
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,278
or being gentle with yourself when you make a mistake

151
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,679
or if you feel sad you're kind with yourself you let

152
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:40,000
yourself be sad and feel the emotions

153
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,520
so many ways we're kind we can be kind to ourselves

154
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,640
it's choosing one

155
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,399
maybe you refer to yourself in terms of endearment

156
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:09,720
maybe you care for this body [Music] by brushing its teeth washing it

157
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,480
hello kindness

158
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:28,720
what if we saw these as acts of kindness not as

159
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:37,360
these boring things we have to do but if we saw them as acts of kindness

160
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,720
shifted the frame

161
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,159
now if you like opening up the door

162
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:25,360
and inviting to others

163
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:32,880
acts of care generosity thoughtfulness to others

164
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:41,520
letting yourself relish yeah this is kindness

165
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:48,919

a lot of the stuff that came up in terms of

202
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,599
when i was thinking of um you know kindness from me

203
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:21,359
and i was like oh this is things that are manifesting as a result of this practice that was

204
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:27,839
nice to see oh sweet that is so sweet thanks for

205
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:33,359
sharing that fosu so if i heard that correctly just realizing that many of the things that

206
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:40,400
are manifesting is as a result of this practice you're doing the the mental practices coming to fruition in acts of

207
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:49,280
kindness is that did i hear that correctly yeah pretty pretty much yeah yeah oh that's so beautiful yay yay

208
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,680
wow to celebrate that and as the buddha says whatever you um

209
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,040
you uh ponder you you reflect and ponder upon frequently that becomes the

210
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:07,680
inclination of your mind so as you ponder upon kindness that becomes the reflect

211
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:15,040
your inclination of not just your mind but the inclination of your heart and your body in acts of kindness yay

212
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,880
oh i celebrate that it's beautiful thanks for sharing that fossil and it's so true

213
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,839
so true rad i see your hand please

214
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,000
hi hi um so

215
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,359
yeah i feel like this practice was really um

216
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,280
really good for me at the moment because i've been having

217
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,760
like a really difficult past month i've been having like housing issues and

218
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,880
having to move like every week and stuff um

219
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,838
and yeah i guess i just realized um

220
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,160
yeah i think kind of when you're in that sort of situation it's really hard to receive

221
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,240
the kindness that people show you because you're kind of in that headspace of trying to figure out

222
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,720
um yeah it's like well what if it goes wrong or no like i don't need that i need this and

223
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:27,119
um yeah it just really helps um when you said to just drop into the heart and the

224
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,200
belly and just like receive it there rather than being in the head um

225
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:39,119
and even just the intention that people show to like the amount of people who have

226
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:45,119
offered that i could stay with them and stuff um it was yeah really um

227
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:50,720
heartening yeah oh thanks so much for sharing that

228
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,800
that is so beautiful to turn as you and and as you were saying of course it is challenging and

229
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:04,400
it's difficult moving frequently takes a toll takes a toll on the mind and always planning and new environment and as

230
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:10,000
you've shifted and receiving so much kindness oh my goodness i my heart feels

231
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,440
full feeling the goodness the the generosity of people who are supporting you and

232
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,880
offering you to stay with them how beautiful is that hello human kindness

233
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,800
how beautiful ah thank you for sharing that that is so sweet

234
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,079
thank you yeah that's lovely and i don't know if you wanted to say

235
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,760
something else i saw your hand moving your welcome yeah i just i guess i just wanted to add

236
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,800
um i was thinking about that um because i heard this

237
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,800
saying the other day of someone talking about joy and they were like you know there's no such thing as perfect joy

238
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:55,520
because as humans we're always feeling more than one emotion at any given time so

239
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:02,400
that thought sort of came to me as well like there's no such thing as perfect kindness either um but

240
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:09,760
to just receive the kindness that is there along with everything else exactly yes it's it's

241
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:16,319
just receive what there is and and that was another invitation i was giving at the time i was suggesting to feel into

242
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:22,319
the heart space not to analyze oh yeah this is a little kind it's a little thought you know it's a little selfish

243
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:27,839
it's like just just let go of all that just tune into the channel of kindness

244
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:34,319
and in that way actually now i'm going to suggest something completely different in that way you can feel into

245
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:40,319
the perfect kindness of it right if you if you really see that aspect it's like

246
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:45,839
earlier when i was suggesting look at look for the color red like well yeah there's a lot of blue and yellow and

247
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:52,160
maybe it's not pure but just i'm just gonna look at the red oh and it's beautiful it's perfect it's like oh my

248
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,440
heart my heart gets filled with joy so that's another

249
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:04,400
practice to bring in thank you for that radha beautiful graham from youtube says there is so much

250
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,839
kindness in the world that i take for granted uh thank you graeme for that

251
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:16,960
beautiful insight he has so much kindness and then we turn towards it and jerry says

252
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,760
it was a struggle to drop the unkind words and actions of others but then the kind actions dominated beautiful that's

253
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:30,800
lovely yay let the kindness prevail beautiful yeah

254
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,200
so so dear friends um let us transition to

255
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:43,200
to uh small groups practicing together um

256
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:51,839
with receiving and sharing simple human kindness with each other

257
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:58,640
this is a sandbox and especially if you've had a hard day or week or month just nice to just feel

258
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:05,200
into this this simple grounding practice and the invitation

259
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:11,599
for the practice is the groups will be roughly size of three

260
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:18,720
and each person listen carefully each person will speak only from their

261
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:24,480
own experience it's an i statement this is what this practice was like for

262
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,359
me or you can be silent when your time comes you can say pass and you say just one nugget if you have

263
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:37,839
five things to say you only say one of them then after you've said that

264
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:44,400
then you pass it on to the next person or the baton gets passed on and the next person will speak from their own

265
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:51,200
experience and then the next person from their own experience you don't ask questions you don't direct you don't

266
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,839
manage you don't work as a facilitator in the small group you just show up with your

267
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:04,079
own kindness sharing yours your own experience and receiving those

268
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:09,359
of others just stay close to your heart to your own experience okay

269
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:15,920
only i statements yes clarity yes so this way we can keep the

270
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,480
container safe for everyone not transgressing okay and again the way

271
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,079
you can show up with kindness tonight might just be holding space and being silent and really listening to others

272
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:35,760
maybe that's what's appropriate for you so so hello human kindness

273
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:42,720
whatever you'd like to share about this practice for you so creating the rooms

274
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:49,200
and uh here we go opening them take care of yourselves

275
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:55,040
take care of each other here we go okay

276
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,319
the rooms are closed everybody's back and we just have about a minute well actually not even

277
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:08,720
that but maybe just a quick comment if somebody who hasn't spoken has a quick reflection we'll fit it in before we

278
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,040
close any takers anything that revealed itself to you in the rooms

279
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,559
that was surprising richard what's up richard

280
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:25,760

282
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:36,880
overflow and warm my heart but

283
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,160
reflecting uh know every time you know when i just talk to people neighbors and people in

284
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:47,839
the building and whatnot there's simply just a genuine friendliness

285
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:54,240
and i guess that's so my meta has been here all along i just didn't know it
