1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:07,120
okay so hello and welcome everyone

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,760
ah it's nice to be with you in the hellos and greetings that we do

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:19,039
[Music] before i turn on the recording is are always are always heartwarming really

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,279
heartwarming to me and really a nice way to just start landing with meta for

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:32,160
ourselves and each other i see many of you also nodding and smiling yep it's supportive coming we come together in

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,440
community in this practice in this international

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,040
community different time zones countries

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,920
so so for today's practice i'd like to invite us

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,640
to to consider the importance of mindfulness of the

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,120
body with meta so mindfulness of the body

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,840
is a primary practice it's actually a foundational practice

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,200
in in this practice of ours and if you have noticed if you've been coming to happier for a while

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,600
we always start the first you know third of the time usually quarter of the time third of the time of

14
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:29,439
the guided meditation is usually grounding in the body with the breath so we always start there and

15
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,880
then we open up to [Music] the practice that we're practicing for

16
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,200
the day if it's meta compassion gratitude whatever it might be so so if you've noticed

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,159
very happy are already this practice of the body is foundational it's really foundational

18
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,640
so today i want to bring it even more to the forefront in the way of how important it is

19
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,960
for establishing meta but we'll actually approach it a little differently today

20
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,960
the body as the basis the body being infused with meta permeating meta the

21
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:16,080
sense of whole bodiness whole bodiness you know we're familiar with the term wholeheartedness

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,000
so whole bodiness sort of mindful body fall so really

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,800
bringing our awareness infusing the body with meta this body this being who is me

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,680
being infused with care with affection with friendliness

25
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,519
and also it it permeating it's shining out

26
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,720
again many times i've talked about the statue of one mudra of the buddha is the mudra

27
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,959
of touching the earth the buddha touching the earth as earth be my witness i belong here

28
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,239
sense of embodiment embodiment connecting with the body

29
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,480
connecting with the body important all practices especially in meta

30
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,560
to connect with the body as much as possible as much as available as much as it feels safe

31
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,800
and having said this for some people if there is a history of trauma it might

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:28,000
be more appropriate to connect with the hands and feet that is the connection with the body

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,280
so if connecting with the whole body is not available that's perfectly okay

34
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,120
don't push it please no pushing no struggling no shoulding

35
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,120
the practice of meta these are just invitation it's just

36
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:52,239
invitations to consider as we come together in community

37
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,000
so that's the frame for our practice today

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,599
so with that frame i invite us ah to land in our bodies and notice what

39
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:12,799
your body needs if you need to move to shift as we start our form or meditation

40
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:21,199
if you need to move to a lying position that's okay if that's your body needs

41
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:29,440
see how your body can be particularly comfortable for meta it's really important for the body to be comfortable

42
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,199
so be kind be kind to this body especially today

43
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:43,478
given that that is the theme kind to this body

44
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,360
so

45
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:12,840

46
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,360

take care of itself internally digest

49
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,639

52

53

61
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,160
when we give a gift to someone we don't force or push the gift upon them

62
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,920
it's an offering so offering your awareness gently lovingly

great great um and sometimes there may not but warmth

169
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,720
may not be sense it's okay but if there is space for things to be held

170
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,839
a patient space for things to be held that is as good as

171
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:39,200
meta you know when we're patient like it can be it's okay this pain doesn't need to go away be pushed away there's space

172
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:46,720
for it to be held monica says there came a point where

173
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,839
sensations of the body arose seem to be manifestations of kindness

174
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:58,640
inseparable from kind awareness just another form lovely thank you for sharing that

practice small groups i'll share one thing and and

196
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:24,800
i'll say that for me um this was quite a lovely practice too because as i

197
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,319
guide the guided meditation probably you know by now that i'm doing it myself i'm

198
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:35,839
not just a talking head i'm actually guiding from where i am from my own

199
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,960
experience and

200
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:48,079
and again this also to say that you know we co-create this space together this

201
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:54,319
practice together i am here because of you well you may think you're here because of me but i'm

202
00:43:54,319 --> 00:44:02,640
here because of you so thank you for showing up and practicing and to say that for me as today i

203
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:09,040
i was experiencing a lot of pain oh it was just so lovely to hold all of

204
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:15,440
the discomfort with just kind kind easy

205
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:23,200
uh there's a sense of well-being well-being for me that really bubbled up

206
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:29,440
the pain this discomfort can be here the well-being can be here too the

207
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,480
kindness holding both kindness really holding both doesn't have to push

208
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,319
the discomfort away so

209
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,000
yeah thank you patricia deeply grateful for sharing this beautiful practice with you

210
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
all thank you yeah it's sweet and hugh says this little

211
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,160
light of mine i'm gonna let it shine yes please you by all means

212
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:04,400
that's great so he is joining on youtube tonight so

213
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,480
so dear ones yeah i love that it's the sense of this light of meta this light

214
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:17,520
of meta letting it shine both for ourselves touching hitting this body first as it's

215
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:24,160
shining out and then others so with that with this letting our light

216
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:31,520
shine the invitation now is to hold each other's light and shining

217
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:40,000
it with small groups holding ourselves with kindness holding each other with kindness we all have bodies we all have

218
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:48,400
discomfort we all have joys as abraham said our bodies are nourishing sources of refuge for many

219
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,720
meditative experiences that the body supports not only physical experiences walking outside and feeding ourselves

220
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:01,280
and all of that so so we turn to small groups of size roughly three

221
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,960
and the first 15 seconds so let's start with

222
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:13,599
the silent meta for our bodies and other people's bodies which may be hurting or not who

223
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:19,680
knows we all have bodies and then you can share as little or as much as

224
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:26,319
you like about your practice supporting each other it's really about listening and

225
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:31,520
sharing and supporting so here we go take care of yourselves take

226
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,640
care of each other in the small groups here we go

227
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:42,880
and everyone's back welcome back everyone so

228
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,880
we have a couple of minutes for any reflections that might have arisen from

229
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:56,800
your group practice small sangha practice and you can raise your hand your zoom

230
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:02,800
hand if it's a physical hand i won't see you but the zoom hand i will see or you can

231
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,920

232
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,319
this particular way of practicing for you

233
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:22,960
the violet says someone in our group reflected at the end how easy it is now during practice to

234
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,079
call to mind the faces and names of people in the sangha we've been with for

235
