1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,700
so uh so good morning welcome uh

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:16,020
um yeah Gil um Gill is uh feeling under the

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,720
weather he's okay but uh was just feeling tired and um a little feverish

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,880
and so um he's resting and uh asks him

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,220
when to step in so here we are um

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:41,120
okay uh so let's uh yeah that's that's it together

7
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:11,160
just letting all the thought and feeling come to rest here

8
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,060
and take its place amidst awareness

9
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,519
letting gravity have you

10
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,640
the dependability of the Earth's support

11
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,980
and the breath

12
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:28,040
that soothes what's overactive and vitalizes what is flat

13
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:51,860
to pay attention is to pay attention to change

14
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,959
everything in motion

15
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,380
no such thing as things really

16
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,600
nothing on

17
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,339
everything momentarily rented

18
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:57,380
but we cannot open to a Nietzsche

19
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:04,339
the changingness of all things we cannot open to in each

20
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,500
from a place of fragmentation brittleness

21
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,100
so we establish a sense of Refuge

22
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,200
the center line

23
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:53,540
kind of inner safety stability

24
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:02,899
that's unrocked by

25
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,060
changing conditions

26
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,040
foreign

27
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,139
we find a Kind of Love

28
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:12,260
that's flexible enough malleable enough

29
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:21,019
to absorb the the body blows of Being Human

30
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:21,300
ordinarily we have our

31
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:26,779
our home base from which we

32
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,300
gaze Upon Our Life gaze upon phenomena

33
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:44,180
as if the view were outside the flow of change

34
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:05,959
but this River has no banks

35
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,900
whatever vantage point we take as ground

36
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,380
is just more change that we're not noticing

37
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:55,260
and so we start to join the river

38
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:00,559
of change the River of Life

39
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:39,559
in a sense nothing can be protected

40
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:48,320
but nothing needs our protection

41
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,179
it's a radical openness

42
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,700
the mesh of our being is one of my teacher says so open

43
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:21,260
that uh experience flows through

44
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,919
we literally practice this practice

45
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:59,580
and of course bits of our experience congeals

46
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:04,580
become solid needs their protection

47
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:17,659
and then we melt back into this uh River

48
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,658
wide flowing

49
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,100
unobstructed

50
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,900
foreign

51
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,880
okay it's good to uh good to see with you

52
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:24,840
um so Gil um Gill let me know that uh the

53
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:31,260
theme was was mindfulness amidst change mindfulness of change

54
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:37,940
and to um

55
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:46,559
as I said in the instructions to be mindful to be mindful

56
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:52,140
is to be mindful of change there's really no such thing as

57
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:59,100
mindfulness of stasis there's no

58
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:06,720
um mindfulness of a of a thing or even a person it's only the process

59
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,899
by which phenomena comes to be

60
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:21,779
comes to pass so bikubody says a niche impermanence on

61
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:26,880
reliability and each does not mean merely that everything

62
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,460
comes to an end it means that something deeper and more pervasive namely

63
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:38,580
that conditioned phenomena are in constant process happenings which break

64
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:44,539
up and perish almost as soon as they arise

65
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:52,440
now um before

66
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,720
I start talking tough about uh letting

67
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,960
go

68
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:11,460
talking tough about um about letting go and relinquishment and a Nietzsche and

69
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,620
all of that I I just should admit that I don't

70
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,720
really like change yeah

71
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,980
that in a way my fantasy deluded fantasy

72
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:38,520
is that I could get the world just how I like it and kind of

73
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:45,720
hold it still and hold it that way forever

74
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:52,380
and I suspect that um

75
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,419
you know the Buddhist teacher that doesn't like change that's a little

76
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:04,860
ridiculous but I suspect that's actually why I got into the path that um

77
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:11,039
I get into practice because I knew I knew intuitively that everything would

78
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:19,760
change and I knew that um my heart was unprepared

79
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:26,840
that I needed to prepare my heart for the changingness of all things

80
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:35,340
there's a study from a few years ago researchers recruited about 20 000

81
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:41,340
people to do a series of studies and they asked half the participants how

82
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:48,840
much they believed they would change over the next decade terms of personality

83
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:56,760
and values and preferences and then they asked the other half how

84
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:02,419
much they actually had changed over the past decade

85
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:07,919
and what they found was when they did this across all ages but what they found

86
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,158
was for example the 50 year old predicted much less change across their

87
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,520
50s and the 60 year old had actually experienced

88
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:27,540
in their 50s and the authors conclude people it seems

89
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:34,200
regard the present as a watershed moment at which they have finally become the

90
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,358
person they will be for the rest of their lives

91
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:46,398
history it seems is always ending today

92
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:51,799
history it seems is always ending today

93
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,500
the Assumption of permanence

94
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:05,640
it said something I've alluded to it said that our brain is a kind of prediction

95
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:12,619
machine and as fragile creatures amidst uh

96
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:22,380
unimaginably vast forces we must be making predictions

97
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:28,040
and we are relentlessly attempting to

98
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:34,820
make predictions that minimize the gap between our

99
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:42,720
model and what comes next our model of self and world and what

100
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,180
comes next in other words

101
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:55,260
we're trying never to be surprised

102
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:02,579
in each moment we're trying not to be surprised by the

103
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:08,700
next and not to be surprised by

104
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:16,800
five years from now and we see this in meditation the the

105
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:24,420
way we maintain so many reference points we keep tabs on samsara

106
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:32,720
the reference points of self and other past and future likes and dislikes

107
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:40,800
where I begin where I end what does this back pain mean what does this heartache

108
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:48,420
mean what does this fluttering anxious feeling mean what does this mean

109
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:53,660
for the trajectory of my life what does this mean

110
00:36:54,540 --> 00:37:01,320
and we're trying to trace out this moment and ensure that it has us on a

111
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,359
kind of trajectory that feels okay

112
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:15,720
and that's so innocent but we can wind up living in those kind

113
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:21,380
of narrow claustrophobic models we've created

114
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,880
trying not to be surprised

115
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:37,220
it's harder to grow and learn to update our sense our models

116
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,339
and I find change is always a little bit startling you know even when you think you're

117
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:50,940
prepared for it change is always a little startling because the Assumption of permanence

118
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:58,500
does run deep it runs deep and the Buddha dwelled on the three

119
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,500
characteristics

120
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:09,960
change unsatisfactoriness or incompletion not self dwelled on the three

121
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:20,220
characteristics because in a sense the default assumption we we live in is the opposite

122
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:29,940
the opposite of the three characteristics we fantasize about a durable pleasure that

123
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:37,320
might structure our lives and end are seeking

124
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:44,760
we fantasize about tying up all the Loose Ends of Being Human of

125
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:50,760
of gaming out samsara of managing uncertainty

126
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,780
of living forever

127
00:38:55,859 --> 00:39:03,500
and we fantasize about taking a kind of um taking refuge and an identity

128
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:11,240
arriving and Landing finding a home in self-view

129
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,880
and none of this can work in the end

130
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:27,300
but before the three characteristics are liberating we often have to grieve them

131
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:34,740
grieve them and so when Gill mentioned last night

132
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:39,839
that this is a theme the first thing that came to my mind

133
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:47,339
um was you know to deeply enjoy

134
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:52,619
periods of stability deeply enjoy

135
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:57,380
by knowing the tenuousness of it all

136
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,859
in those those windows of of relative stability

137
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:10,920
we enjoy but we enjoy not thinking it will go on forever we enjoy

138
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,740
deeply even more deeply because we know the tenuousness of it

139
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:21,960
that this moment is held together by causes and

140
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:29,119
conditions that we will never see we could never fully appreciate

141
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:37,040
the millions the the everything of the causes and conditions

142
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:44,119
that converge and create this moment this breath in this moment

143
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,800
and so we come to enjoy gratitude not in the artificial

144
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,140
way of you know sometimes feels

145
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:06,180
uh fake or something but is like no this is uh wow this breath yeah

146
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:11,059
this goodness this person this love

147
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:19,020
the path is uh is a dialectic of of Tranquility safety

148
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:26,838
seclusion and on the other hand letting the world rush into our heart

149
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,019
and uh making peace with imperfection

150
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:41,220
but we cannot really acclimatize to a Nietzsche from a place of fragmentation

151
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:47,599
right on this and so we

152
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:54,720
establish a sense of of inner stability of Refuge

153
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,000
of seclusion of protection

154
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:08,160
John Halifax said her line came to mind that um strong back soft front strong

155
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:16,740
back soft front it's such a beautiful encapsulation strung back

156
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:26,099
saffron we cultivate stability we have our Sila

157
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:34,640
Sila are honoring of goodness

158
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:44,780
we have our devotion to Buddha damasanga kind of Devotion to uh to love

159
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:52,800
maybe we have a sense of um of lineage lineage of being in the kind

160
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,260
of stream of dhamma

161
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:05,880
is a a meditator yesterday as a college student

162
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:12,720
told me that that they're I guess in music he's a musician a

163
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:19,800
classical musician and um nine Generations back is Franz list or

164
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,680
something like that you know kind of the Proto he's the Protege of the

165
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:31,680
Protege of the Protege of nine Generations back you get this classical

166
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:38,839
pianist students right and um

167
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:51,500
What's um what's our lineage

168
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:10,200
so there are stabilizing forces and um

169
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:17,099
and then there's uh then there's equanimity and that our heart

170
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:23,720
uh doesn't um depend on samsara

171
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,819
that um Anita of course

172
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:36,020
um can be is heartbreaking

173
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:43,380
but um the momentariness of change

174
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:52,880
that River with no banks actually comes to feel can feel like a refuge

175
00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:03,559
and because we we know ourselves as part of that River as made of change

176
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:09,599
it's like uh nothing can collide with

177
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,079
our heart

178
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:23,880
so I offer this for your consideration

179
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,900
and uh

180
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:34,020
yeah appreciate what's uh just caught a

181
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:41,400

182
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:48,859
