1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,920
hello and welcome to this meditation session and as a beginning I'd like

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,960
to tell you of a study that I read about many years

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:26,439
ago where they took um some teenagers from deep in Metropolitan

4
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:33,040
New York grew up kind of in a uh without ever leaving New York and then living

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:41,440
kind of I think they were people living somewhat poor lives and and um you know so their range of

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,440
experience was quite small and they took them to some place like the jungles of Costa

7
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,680
Rica uh to go out with the people who had spent their life teenagers who had

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:01,039
spent their life living in that environment and the locals in Costa Rica

9
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:08,640
would point out birds and different things happening in the forest and uh that stood out

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,640
jumped out to them it was obvious to them that they could see them and but the the teens from New York could not

11
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,439
see them they didn't have the ability they didn't know where to look and how to see

12
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,560
and and so the story points to the idea that we get accustomed to a particular

13
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:35,320
way of what we're familiar with and we maybe pick up what's familiar but

14
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:42,680
there's a lot that we miss as a result in meditation uh that tendency comes that

15
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,759
we come with our familiar world of thoughts and concerns and even the way

16
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,799
that we uh think of ourselves uh can be uh kind of set in

17
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,560
our ways so that we're not so sensitive and attuned to notice other aspects of

18
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:09,200
our experience to uh to become skilled in

19
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,640
samadi is to begin to become sensitive and expand the range of what we're aware

20
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:24,400
of so we can be aware of the subtle shifts that go on the shifts that uh uh

21
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,080
show us the path of Samar the shifts that uh open to a deep deing absorption

22
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,200
deep deepening mind state of samadi and so part of that is the

23
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,560
evidence that samadi just beginning maybe the first kind of beginning of

24
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,840
things that lead to a state of samadi if we spend our time preoccupied with what

25
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,360
to have for lunch preoccupied with the argument we had before preoccupied with

26
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,519
um kind of a negative selft talk or maybe positive self s talk

27
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,959
even that um if that's the normal way of seeing the lens through which we see we

28
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:14,599
might not have the Mind quiet enough um or capacity to sense sensitive

29
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:22,720
enough to start listening to the finding the rare animals in the forest the birds

30
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,879
in the forest like I think some people who are going bird watching and want to listen for the

31
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,000
cries of the bird might make their thinking mind

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,680
quiet to have a and everything become still inside of them except for their

33
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:47,480
listening for that quiet bird song So in meditation then when you sit

34
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,920
down to meditate to be start becoming attuned to

35
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,959
the subtle shifts that happen that um

36
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,560
the subtle shifts that that they have um in

37
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,920
um uh in your

38
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,560
uh uh in what happens to you as you sit down to meditate and in the course of

39
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,600
the meditation what are the subtle shifts and they not so subtle shifts that that are the evidence or the

40
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:31,720
Gathering Together that repes represents somebody and um

41
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,160
and uh and so when you first sit down uh you might come along with a lot

42
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:46,680
of your concerns but is there a feeling of goodness or rightness or heness in

43
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:54,479
your body as you sit down does something already begin to relax and soften taking the meditation

44
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,039
posture and if so uh feel that a align

45
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:06,479
yourself with that attune yourself to that as you begin to relax

46
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:14,560
intentionally what are the what's the what's the impact the influence that

47
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,360
relaxing has on the parts of the muscles that relax around the muscles and the rest of

48
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:27,400
you in what way does beginning to Center yourself here on the body on the breath

49
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,520
begin to quiet your mind begin to shift the direction of where

50
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:39,960
your concerns are where your attention is going as you settle in more are there

51
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:46,880
subtle shifts of things becoming calmer or more centered or more

52
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:55,840
grounded to pick those up to see them as the the as the traces of the path to be

53
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,840
followed not to hold on to them not to push anything but to the more we can feel all we have to

54
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,240
do is see them and feel them and sense these the evidence of samade beginning

55
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,319
to grow for that be contribute to the Gathering and more important to

56
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:21,360
contribute to the mind the attention wanting to be here in this process this

57
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:29,680
process of somi starts feeling very inviting uh it because it's uh enjoy

58
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:37,360
able it's Pleasant there's a goodness and rightness to it we're following the evidence the path the

59
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,960
trail of something that uh feels really

60
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,360
good and before we last thing I'll say is that this being skilled in the

61
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:56,639
evidence of suar however subtle it might be is

62
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:04,120
um is um the Buddha sometimes calls being skilled in the

63
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:11,479
beautiful and there's something about samadi the evidence of it that maybe we can start appreciating as a certain kind

64
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:18,560
of beauty even though it's only maybe 1% of our

65
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,520
experience that's where the trail is that's where the path is not to push other things

66
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:31,400
away but not to leave it out to become attuned

67
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:37,039
aligned encouraged guided

68
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,199
supported by this subtle evidence that allows you to get more and

69
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:49,680
more settled so to assume a meditation

70
00:07:52,080 --> 00:08:00,520
posture and closing your eyes and now feeling

71
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:07,800
ing the subtle shifts that's happened for you in assuming a meditation

72
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,680
posture is something

73
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:21,560
subtle is there a goodness or a rightness in beginning to

74
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:30,479
be connected to oneself simply from taking the posture

75
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,760
gently slowly taking some deeper

76
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:49,120
breaths and as you exhale soften relaxing in the

77
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,240
body and as the body relaxes is is there a subtle influence

78
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:08,320
or effect that has in parts of your body that feels

79
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,320
good

80
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,240
to let your breathing return to

81
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,360
normal and is there already just sitting here

82
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:59,000
quietly in your own body heart and mind

83
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:07,680
some subtle shift that's happening that you associate with

84
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,879
meditation that feels

85
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:21,279
good and to be attuned to that aligned with

86
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:27,240
that almost as if the way you're going to pay attention

87
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,200
the way you're going to be aware

88
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,800
somehow takes on qualities of the caling that you feel in

89
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,839
your body or pleasure or the

90
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:01,959
goodness and with a normal breath to on the exhale to relax more

91
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:07,760
fully in the body in different parts of the body in

92
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,279
the whole body

93
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:50,920
relaxing and into a subtle Place deep

94
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,200
within the settling spot the grounding

95
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:04,720
spot the centering spot Within maybe where the exhale

96
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,399
finishes and the inhale

97
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,680
begins and is there some glow or Radiance

98
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,920
or softening

99
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,440
caling that's spreading a little bit beyond the edges of your

100
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,639
breathing in some parts of your

101
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:00,880
body some evidence that the process of meditation

102
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,240
is

103
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:13,920
beginning it doesn't have to be dramatic or could be very subtle and

104
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:24,199
quiet but notice it appreciate its presence

105
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,800
and

106
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,360
to settle into the sensations of breathing

107
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,079
as if awareness and

108
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,040
breathing are

109
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,560
gently absorbing each

110
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,880
other as if in the meeting of breathing and

111
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,959
awareness something good begins to

112
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,360
happen and awareness it's very light

113
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,880
as light as a butterfly that lands on the

114
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,519
breathing as light as

115
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,519
sunlight that shines its

116
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,839
beauty on the experience of

117
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
breathing

118
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
e e

119
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:30,840
sensitive to the subtlest of shifts

120
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,919
that come with

121
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:49,679
meditation not searching for them but in a relaxed way sensing

122
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:56,240
them so that part of the shifts is it shifts in the

123
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,840
mind the Mind becoming soft

124
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,519
lighter and where this the sum total of the shifts that we

125
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,720
feel gently guide the mind guide

126
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:47,880
attention to be intimate with the experience of

127
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,760
breathing e

128
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:07,640
and noticing any pleasure that is also a symptom evidence

129
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:14,320
of the practice of

130
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
meditation

131
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

132
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

133
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

134
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

135
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

136
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,480
e e

137
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:33,559
as we approach the end of the sitting maybe letting go of focusing on the

138
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:41,240
breathing letting go of your thoughts and becoming aware

139
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:49,799
of the general Broadway in which You've Been Changed by this

140
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:58,240
meditation is there a broader embodied feelings

141
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:05,880
being calmer more settled some broader feeling of

142
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,679
something that's Pleasant settled

143
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,880
relaxed a greater intimacy Here and

144
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,979
[Music]

145
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:33,559
Now to feel the broadest widest

146
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:40,880
sense widest evidence of a shift in the course of the

147
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:49,399
meditation a shift that is good that feels

148
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:55,960
good feels satisfying feels Pleasant

149
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:06,200
even if there are other things that are troubling and difficult that to allow that to be as it

150
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,039
is but to attune yourself to the more subtle way that in

151
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:21,760
the body heart and mind there might be some subtle way

152
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:29,880
that of pleasure of calmness goodness intimacy

153
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,520
quiet and if there

154
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:49,759
is with the lightest possible

155
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,000
touch allow the rhythm of breathing to gently move through do it

156
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,799
to touch it to

157
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,679
recognize the broader feeling evidence of how things have

158
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,720
shifted in a good way

159
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:52,320
and if you stay connected to whatever that's been

160
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:59,279
good that has shifted in the course of this meditation imagine imagine yourself

161
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:05,480
settled in that allow yourself to be settled in

162
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,760
that as you now turn your attention your

163
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:17,559
thoughts out into the world that you'll encounter

164
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,840
today and to en allow yourself to encounter that world of today

165
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:36,279
from this subtle place of meditation the goodness of it the subtleness of

166
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:43,320
it so there's room for Good

167
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:50,440

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:21,360
about see in person or on a

172
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:28,360
screen that you imagine them being settled and happy

173
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:36,760

[Music]

179
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,360
thank

180
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
you e

181
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:13,679
so hello and welcome to this next talk on

182
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:21,880
samadi and um this time I want to discuss the topic of the

183
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:29,240
evidence of samadi the evidence of becoming more

184
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:37,440
settled calm absorbed connected to the meditation

185
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:45,559
process and um in uh in the language of the Buddha there was a word for this

186
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:54,200
evidence the symptoms and uh it is nimita n i m

187
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,360
TTA and it's um one day two days two T's

188
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:06,720
um maybe it's one t but nimita and it um it

189
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:14,200
um it is um sometimes has kind of come down into the present times in the

190
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:21,919
meditation traditions of Buddhism to uh refer to only one example of the the

191
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:28,279
symptom of meditation and um I don't not going to bother you with what that one

192
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:34,799
example is because it it's really an example of what comes out of a very particular way of practicing

193
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:40,799
meditation uh in the ancient world there was just lots of symptoms for what uh

194
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:46,919
evidence for what happens as we meditate and um and so that whatever it

195
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:54,679
is whatever the symptoms are what shifts and change um is uh meant to support the

196
00:32:54,679 --> 00:33:01,880
practice and uh one of the words that uh I associate with this is uh Beauty and

197
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:08,120
the Buddha called talked about the becoming skilled in the beauty of

198
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:13,519
Samar because these symptoms that we have this evidence are have a beauty to

199
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,880
them or a pleasure to them or rightness or goodness to them they have there

200
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:26,360
sometime sometimes they they feel healthy there's a healthful health healthiness that comes along with

201
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:32,440
them and uh um and the idea is to be sensitive to them and include them as

202
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,799
part of the range of what we're aware of as we

203
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:44,720
meditate and um and generally what I suggest is not to take them as the focus

204
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:51,799
of meditation don't get preoccupied or caught in them and uh even though they feel good some people are pumping them

205
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:57,120
up trying to make this stronger but the idea is the symptoms that feel calmer

206
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:06,120
more subtle um often is associated as we get deeper into with uh different Sensations

207
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:12,878
feelings emotions even that are quite Pleasant like joy and happiness and um

208
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:20,200
and a lot of pleasure physical kind of sense of pleasure that flows or radiates from the meditation

209
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,320
itself and so rather than focusing on them or being preoccupied with them or

210
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:32,158
drawing conclusions for them or congratulating yourself for them being there the idea is to take them as a as

211
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:38,919
cheerleaders and say continue what you're doing what you're doing is good and uh and let them be there on the

212
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:44,919
edges supporting you guiding you and sometimes what you can feel is that as

213
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:52,079
like with the breathing with the Rhythm or breathing you can feel that as you kind of Follow That Rhythm and get more

214
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:58,400
absorbed and more intimate with it you can feel that it has a growing effect on

215
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,880
the evidence on the nimita on the effect that the wider effect that it has on

216
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:11,040
your body mind and and heart and uh so there can be tingling in

217
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,839
the body there can be a sense of wonderful delightful humming or vibration there can be a feeling of

218
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:24,480
things becoming body becoming lighter and softer translucent um the body seems to become

219
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,680
uh uh the in in the inside of the body can start see feeling like it's like a

220
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:37,040
vast wonderful kind of Cavern or uh Great Space feeling more and more space

221
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:43,240
is one of these evidence of of the Mind entering Sadi Sometimes some people will feel

222
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:50,800
that the mind seems to become very quite expansive that the narrow mind the contracted mind is often a sign of

223
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:57,720
preoccupation being caught in something and as we're less caught the mind starts feeling more expansive and that's this

224
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,800
evidence the sign um sometimes the people use the word sign quite a bit for what I'm

225
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,880
talking about the symptom the sign the evidence and uh sometimes there can be a

226
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:16,599
strong Sensations flow of pleasure sometimes it has a flowing feeling in the body sometimes it has a pulsing

227
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:24,280
feeling in the body and sometimes in intense ways it can feel like a cascading waterfall or breaking waves of

228
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,920
pleasure that rushes through the body so it can be strong but it's it doesn't

229
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,319
have to be strong and in some ways it's can be more useful if it's not so strong

230
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:40,520
some people push it and try to make these things strong but uh the just well

231
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:47,000
enough that it supports the mind to get quieter supports this the a seeing or

232
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:55,119
following the trail that's open up opening up in front of us as we meditate of a trail or onward leading to a

233
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,359
feeling of um of of mean each person can choose their own

234
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:08,319
word to describe this a feeling of coming home a feeling of intimacy a feeling of being uh deeply calm and at

235
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:15,599
ease feeling of being peaceful a feeling of kind of being absorbed gathering together and being

236
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:23,720
really here in a wholehearted way in a wholebody way and whm minded way this

237
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,800
feeling of being complete and whole right with her our

238
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,319
experience and um sometimes this the symptom can be uh the inner eye or the

239
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:42,240
eyes it can seem like SE light sometimes it can be white light some people will see

240
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:48,599
different color lights sometimes the lights are colored lights are shifting and changing in different kinds of

241
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:54,599
patterns or something and uh again it's best not to get focused on those things that can be

242
00:37:54,599 --> 00:38:01,000
quite entertaining or interesting if it's colors um but the idea is to always let these things these symptoms be in

243
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,079
the periphery as saying is almost like encouragements yes this is a sign that

244
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:14,800
the meditation is going well um let's not get involved with the signs let's not get preoccupied with them and let's

245
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,839
kind of just stay keep the hold the course hold the course don't get distracted by

246
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:26,520
them and some of the signs and symptoms will settle away over time and disappear

247
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:31,680
to be replaced by by others some might get stronger before they settle away and

248
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:38,000
disappear and uh and generally the the momentum and movement of somebody is a

249
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,480
is a movement towards more calm more peace uh more Simplicity greater and

250
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:54,240
greater Simplicity that feels very very satisfying to to have and so uh these signs symptoms um

251
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,359
Can Ur uh start occurring at the very beginning when you first sit down

252
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:07,640
especially if you're used to you have a familiar and comfortable posture to sit down into when you meditate the

253
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:13,800
familiarity the regularity of assuming this posture means that almost

254
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:20,599
immediately uh we are um um we can start feeling something is

255
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:26,480
beginning to shift shift in a good way and we a little calmer the body softens

256
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,800
and relax um there's a feeling of things the body not being aligned some people don't

257
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,240
really live in a really good aligned posture in ordinary life but in

258
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:45,560
meditation it can feel so good to kind of take that kind of a posture that's upright and aligned and anything that

259
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:52,880
feels good about the posture then about relaxing centering oneself on the

260
00:39:52,880 --> 00:40:01,040
breathing kind of resting in the settling place like grounding place um

261
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:07,200
uh any way in which it feels good for the mind to be attentive and this is

262
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,400
where the art of samade has a lot to do with the art of learning how to use our

263
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:19,839
attention in a way that we enjoy that feels nice if we're jerking the mind around if

264
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:25,040
we're pouncing on them ourselves because we're wondered off and that's not good

265
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,359
and we're then uh straining and bearing down to like we desperate to be

266
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:38,760
concentrated that's not a beautiful that's not enjoyable that's not a a pleasant way of being aware but to find

267
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:45,920
a way that's Pleasant to be aware so the Mind wants to be aware in the present moment so the mind is more interested in

268
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,599
being attentive to the present than it is to be preoccupied in thoughts so all

269
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:58,000
of what I'm describing can be understood as being the symptoms and signs that the

270
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:06,079
meditation beginning to uh create a good context a good feeling in within and

271
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:12,800
sometimes it could be subtler than some of the difficult feelings that we have and it isn't that we want to push

272
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,560
the the difficult feelings away or condemn them or something but uh to feel

273
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:25,480
some any of these subtler signs of calm or subtleness or goodness or um

274
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:31,079
receptivity that's there that um that becomes a way to hold what's

275
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:36,560
difficult that's a way to relate to it that's a way of caring for it in a nice

276
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:43,119
kind of container and a nice attitude so that uh it itself the difficulties we

277
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,359
have are being tended being uh cared for

278
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:57,560
being nurtured be uh by Love by Care by kindness by uh

279
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:04,720
spaciousness by allowing them to be there in a soft accepting way and there's a kind of a sense of the beauty

280
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,839
of it or the calm or the pleasure of meditation kind of maybe allows what's

281
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:16,200
difficult to soften by itself to be felt in a different context so we're not so

282
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,520
caught in it or troubled by it so

283
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:29,319
um um so the signs of meditation the nimita the evidence of it of what's

284
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:35,400
Happening there's an art to learning how to gently

285
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:41,440
modestly um use them to support the Gathering Together the unification the

286
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:48,520
settling the onward leading nature of meditation as we start entering into the

287
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:55,160
world of samade where we're entering into kind of a new space a new way of

288
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:06,119
being uh for the duration of samadi so thank you very much and uh may

289
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:12,920
you um I'm very fond of this idea of the word Whisperer like a horse

290
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:18,720
whisperer and um and so may you be the whisper of your

291
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:25,720
samade and um May you respectfully care and listen and sensed to the things that

292
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:32,400
are often overlooked so that you can settle more deeply into the

293
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:42,200
practice so thank you very much and we'll continue tomorrow
