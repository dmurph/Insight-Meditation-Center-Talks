1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,279
welcome welcome and good evening

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,360
it's nice to be here to be with you all

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,000
we had a tbd on the calendar for some for quite some while i wasn't sure who

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,920
is it going to be who's going to be the mystery speaker turns out to be me [Laughter]

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,480
that wasn't the initial plan but i'm happy to be here

6
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:38,320
so last week gil max ernstein and i finished teaching

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,280
this eight month long course that we called the equivalence of ethics

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,719
and enlightenment ee 3e

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:59,680
so 8 months 15 homework assignments you know of reading and the students were writing as

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,878
well once a month and getting in small groups and

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,759
we gave them some prompts to talk about

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,840
and so you might think like ethics oh my goodness [Laughter] that sounds so boring why would anybody

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,840
do that that sounds tedious it sounds uh i don't know just not something necessarily

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,240
one would want to spend so much effort and energy on

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,960
but it's turned out i mean it's not a huge surprise for us teachers

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,399
but even though i've taught that course before a few times actually that

17
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:49,280
it's so rich there's like something that's um even having taught it before to

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,439
really look at the role of ethics or the way you know and to broaden what does it

19
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,560
mean to be ethical and to broaden it to include just the way that we are in the world

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:11,520
so monday being the last class we spend a little time kind of reviewing some things and

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,840
and i kind of combined a few different elements and kind of made up a little bit of a

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:27,120
new way of thinking about the dharma this with having had this experience

23
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,160
because you know we have this expression the dharma and for those of us who

24
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:41,120
taken refuge quote unquote we take refuge in the buddha dharma and sangha but what does that mean really what is the

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,800
dharma and what does it mean to take refuge in it and

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,160
is there a way that we could explore this question

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,080
that we could investigate by using the perspective

28
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,800
of ethics and i actually would say rather than ethics harmlessness

29
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,239
this idea of not wanting to cause harm

30
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:20,239
and not exploring what does it mean to not cause harm

31
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,120
and what does it mean to cause harm

32
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:33,760
so this idea of dharma can we look at it explore it using this as a as a lens

33
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,560
so dharma of course is one way we can understand it is as the teachings

34
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:48,400
of the buddha so maybe like the the doctrine or the words of the buddha

35
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:55,519
this recognition that the buddha and some of his senior followers senior disciples

36
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,840
these wise compassionate people that left instructions that left teachings

37
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,599
so that others could find the same way that they have

38
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,760
so we can be inspired by them so we can learn from them

39
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:23,120
and they're certainly lots of teachings right for those of you who have studied the sutas or the nikayas you know that

40
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,520
there's a whole lot of them in there i myself kind of like enjoy reading them

41
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,160
and looking at them and studying them i for myself getting inspired

42
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,759
and uh here's one verse that's in the dhammapada

43
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:51,600
it's a collection of verses it's probably what's been translated the most i think there's over 20 different

44
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,639
translations available translations into english let alone all the other languages

45
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,919
and you know what sweat up i feel like that the volume is just a little bit low so i feel like i want to strain my voice

46
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,280
just a little bit to that be a tiny bit tighter i let louder so if i'm just

47
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,560
talking like this can we have it just a tiny bit louder is maybe just a tiny bit

48
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,960
more louder so it's so is is it okay for you guys you want it

49
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,240
to go up or is that an okay sign or a go higher sign

50
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,280
okay thank you that's it i felt like i was straining my voice just a little bit trying to be a little bit louder

51
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:42,560
okay so in the dhamma part of this collection of verses there's some like there's some really wonderful and pithy

52
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,039
little verses in there and this one goes like this

53
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:56,560
doing nothing malicious engaging in what is skillful

54
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:04,479
and purifying one's mind this is the teaching of the buddhas

55
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:11,600
so kind of just a summary of all the dharma all the teachings is doing nothing malicious

56
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,600
engaging in what is skillful and purifying one's mind

57
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,919
i kind of like this straightforward way and it brings to mind i don't know if

58
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,680
it's exactly the same but it brings to mind the path of practice as silas

59
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,440
samaripanya the path of practice is first

60
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:42,560
doing nothing malicious sila that is being ethical not causing harm

61
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,759
the second engaging in what is skillful samadhi

62
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,680
samadhi is mental development and meditation concentration and certainly

63
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:01,599
that's skillful but we could also say skillful is ethics so maybe does it not a perfect match

64
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:07,440
but the third verse in the dhammapada i'm sorry the third line is

65
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,120
purifying one's mind this could be also considered maybe part

66
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,639
of wisdom is the contents of the mind or the way that the mind thinks

67
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,720
that could also of course be concentration or mental development

68
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,800
but i think what i'd like to highlight now is this first line

69
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,479
doing nothing malicious two other steps this is the teachings of

70
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,520
the buddha i remember when i was in graduate school

71
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,199
studying buddhism i was in a class and i was the only student who was a practitioner of

72
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:54,240
theravada everybody else was a mahayana practitioner mahayana is the leader buddhism

73
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,759
and the teacher the professor now i don't remember what point he was

74
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:06,240
trying to make but he asked this question okay so if you could

75
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,360
could you just use one word to describe the dharma

76
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:18,400
about his teachings and i thought sure it's easy it's just harmless and it's like do no harm that's

77
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,599
you know three words three monosyllabic words this is really simple

78
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,039
it turns out it's not so simple right because we had a classroom and every single person there in the classroom had

79
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,320
a different idea and the mahayana people some of them i didn't even know what they were talking about

80
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,560
so even though that i'm it's we might want to simplify it

81
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,800
doesn't mean that everybody would agree but for me this idea of do no harm

82
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:54,320
even if it's not i don't know the absolute fundamental

83
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,839
i think it's a fantastic provisional fundamental teaching or a way to be like

84
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:06,320
why not because do no harm sometimes we think about doing no harm is like you know treating

85
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,360
others with respect and not cutting them with knives or shooting

86
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:18,839
them with bullets or something like this but it's also about ourselves

87
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,800
and so much about this practice is we start to see the subtle ways

88
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,640
in which we harm ourselves the subtle ways in which the inner

89
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,959
critic criticizes us or the maybe subtle ways and sometimes we

90
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:43,760
abandon ourselves when difficulties or maybe the way that we don't take care of

91
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,240
ourselves even though we it's good for us to eat well and sleep and exercise and

92
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,480
meditate you know it doesn't mean we always are doing those things and it's not because we're intentionally

93
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:04,800
wanting to cause harm but part of the practice is just recognizing or becoming sensitive to

94
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,320
oh yeah this way isn't the way that leads to the greatest

95
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,279
freedom the greatest ease the greatest peace

96
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,079
so there's another in the suttas also there's a way in which the dharma is described

97
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,200
and it's described as this is part of the teaching that the buddha says and

98
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:36,880
it's when other people are describing the buddha they say oh he's one who teaches the

99
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:44,240
dharma that's beautiful in the beginning beautiful in the middle and beautiful in

100
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,000
the end i feel kind of inspired by this that's

101
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,200
something that's beautiful through and through and so we might think harmlessness too

102
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,519
also has this beauty maybe this grace

103
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:10,000
something about it that you know that where we can be safe and others can

104
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,640
be safe maybe there's something beautiful about that

105
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,920
so the dharma as the doctrine kind of summarizes some of the teachings

106
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,279
of the buddha and of course of course one of the key teachings is

107
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:35,360
the four noble truths many people would say that this is the

108
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,839
key teaching of the buddha we can consider these as

109
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:47,680
pragmatic perspectives that help us guide us in the world and

110
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,800
understand the world and concerned with suffering and the end of

111
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,920
suffering and i know

112
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,680
for me the very first time i heard this was not when i was expecting that it was a

113
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,800
in a yoga class i had no interest in buddhism i didn't even really know what buddhism was

114
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,120
but the yoga teacher said turned out to also be a dharma teacher i

115
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:26,079
didn't know that that didn't mean anything to me at the time this person had a lovely accent from

116
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:32,399
minnesota and i just uh so have this warm-hearted feeling towards people i have a really

117
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,680
thick mint i can't mimic it but a minnesota accent

118
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,800
acknowledging that there is suffering

119
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:50,399
and well all these years ago sitting there on my yoga block i feel like

120
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,240
oh what a relief that somebody's actually talking about

121
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,279
something real and not pretending that everything is okay or

122
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,800
saying how things should be or aren't really

123
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,639
there's a cause for suffering things arise for a cause they're not

124
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:20,480
magical and importantly there's an ending of suffering the third noble truth

125
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,079
and of course the fourth noble truth is the eightfold path there's a way

126
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,760
leading to the ending of suffering it did occur to me what would it be like

127
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,120
if there was not this fourth noble truth oh yeah there's ending but

128
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:44,000
there's no way to get there like it would just be very different right it would be uh

129
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,839
this practice this would be more just about faith or something

130
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:57,600
but maybe we could just boil all this down to if you stop doing something that causes

131
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:07,199
suffering the suffering ends pretty simple pretty straightforward

132
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,480
and so of course in the four noble truths and all these different ways in which we talk about suffering

133
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,440
in this buddhist tradition this is a a word that stands in for such a wide

134
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:28,399
range from just the acute physical that's suffering that humans can experience the

135
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,600
cute emotional suffering anybody who's ever had their heart

136
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,920
broken knows this or a left one die knows this kind of end of the spectrum

137
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:48,160
but also the other end of the spectrum this feeling like there's something that's just not

138
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,279
quite right and i don't know what it is

139
00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:00,079
but it just doesn't feel completely satisfying or doesn't feel quite right

140
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,839
so suffering is this isn't a single word for this whole range

141
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:13,839
but what if we use this word harm instead of the word suffering

142
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,560
and if we considered the same thing whereas suffering has the flavor of maybe of

143
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,399
something we experience and harm as more the flavor of something

144
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:34,240
that gets done either done to us or we do to others

145
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:44,000
but this same idea of tuning into the presence or the absence or what causes

146
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,279
harm and the same way that the four noble truths or

147
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,560
these pragmatic perspectives

148
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:01,040
of using the word harm instead of suffering there is harm there's a cause for harm there's an

149
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,399
ending of harm and there's a path leading to the ending of harm

150
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,560
there's a way in which we might interact or engage with the formidable truths in it

151
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:22,000
and maybe a little bit different way and acknowledging that harm so often is

152
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,079
unintentional sometimes we think about it primarily as

153
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,440
uh being intentional if somebody is willfully

154
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:40,160
harming others but to think about kind of the unintentional

155
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,199
highlights some of the ways in which we harm ourselves that are

156
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,800
not so easy to stop these habits

157
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,320
these compulsions these

158
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,079
just simply not being present for what we are doing and recognizing that harm

159
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,799
causes from that

160
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,678
and these habits and these compulsions and not being present can be an expression of the clinging or the

161
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,038
craving which can be a cause for suffering of

162
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,558
course and because of harm for ourselves partly because we're not present for what's

163
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:34,000
happening or we don't have [Music] the capacity when we're really clinging

164
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,480
on tightly to stop the momentum of the mental habits to stop the

165
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,880
momentum of the emotional habits that cause harm

166
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,039
so to tune into and recognize the ways and that we might

167
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:01,039
be causing ourselves harm not because we want to give one more reason to

168
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:07,120
beat ourselves up or to feel like we're failing or not doing it right

169
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,880
but just to recognize that sometimes when we recognize that when

170
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,000
there's harm arising there can be some compassion there can be some tenderness

171
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,440
like oh yeah this is this is dukkha this is some harm is

172
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,720
being caused by my holding on so tightly to a particular

173
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,640
idea or a belief or

174
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,200
recently i was at a um

175
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,280
a group of where there was a group of people and i showed up having this idea that you know okay i have this

176
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,640
particular role and i'm gonna behave this particular way that's you know appropriate for that

177
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:01,919
role but i didn't realize that nobody else thought i should be in that role

178
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:08,480
and it's quite something right as long as i uh i was hanging on to this idea of like no no i'm the one that does this

179
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,760
and you guys are the one that do that and you know what this is how it's supposed to go but

180
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:20,080
you know it just was a misunderstanding but uh just this recognition like oh just let go

181
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,919
let go diana of this idea that you had and that just was really great it was

182
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:33,600
such an obvious way to see like how many times am i are we are people holding on to how

183
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,440
we think we should be or what's expected from us and then our environment and how

184
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:46,160
other people behave doesn't necessarily match and the suffering

185
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:53,039
the harm that's caused and of course the four noble truths have

186
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,639
the fourth noble truth as the eightfold path

187
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:08,240
and if we look at the eightfold path we can see that four of the factors half of them

188
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:15,520
have a concern with harm the second one right intention

189
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,720
includes with it non-ill will that is some not causing harm not having

190
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,039
hostility and causing harm towards others

191
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,640
right speech right action right livelihood all three of them are associated with ethical behavior

192
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,320
which are you know one way in which we don't harm others

193
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,799
maybe we could stretch it a little bit and say some of this right mindfulness and

194
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,480
right concentration is a way in which to help us not cause harm to let the mind

195
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,158
and the body to settle down

196
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,679
so the eightfold path is a way in which we can consider as a

197
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:10,400
in through this lens as uh to help us not cause harm

198
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,440
intentionally or unintentionally

199
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,120
so one way we can understand the dharma is as the teachings and includes the four noble truths and

200
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,200
includes that pithy little statement from the dhammapada but another way we can understand the

201
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:36,000
dharmas not just as some concept or some idea

202
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,159
that's you know existing out there in the ether somewhere just as language or

203
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:49,600
thoughts intangible but the dharma is also something the way that we show up in the world the way in

204
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,799
which we interact with the world

205
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,640
through the way that we live because

206
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,919
there's a way in which with certain skills or intentions

207
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,600
the way that we that we are allows the dharma to be expressed

208
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,799
allows the dharma to have a role in our lives

209
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,799
so not so not only is a dorm as a concept but the way that we show up

210
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,799
and here's another quote from the dhammapada

211
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,000
goes like this not by harming living beings is one a

212
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,440
noble one by being harmless

213
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:46,158
to all living beings is one called a noble one

214
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:54,159
so to be harmless the word here is ahimsa of non-violence so to not have any

215
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,880
violence to be acting with harmlessness is to be a

216
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,600
noble one that ties in with the four noble truths

217
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,440
maybe some of you know that there's a number of ways we can translate that expression that's often

218
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,200
called the four noble truths but it could also be the four truths of the noble ones

219
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,840
that paulie allows for that translation as well

220
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,080
so the noble truths of the or the truths of the noble ones

221
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,760
and the noble ones are the ones who are harmless

222
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,880
for noble truths can also be the four enabling truths

223
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,919
there is something ennobling about being harmless

224
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,559
the uprightness the

225
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,559
the steadiness the clarity that's associated with not

226
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,880
causing harm right the sensitivity enabling

227
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:16,799
but with our as we practice the dharma with our spiritual maturity if you will

228
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,919
our sensitivity to harm grows it increases

229
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:30,320
and we begin to notice it in subtler and subtler manifestations or

230
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,480
and we become more sensitive to that contraction to that tightness that a little bit of

231
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:44,000
sense of something's not right here when we're considering causing harm

232
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,520
or when certainly when harm is when we harm ourselves or somebody else has harmed us

233
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:56,640
as well and then particularly that gets heightened uh highlighted when

234
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,640
as our practice develops we also become aware of the spaciousness the ease and

235
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,440
the increased freedom that's available as possible

236
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:14,960
and so as we notice more spaciousness we can notice like oh the contrast with the constriction that

237
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:23,120
happens that's associated with harming this constriction can

238
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:30,640
be also expelled i'm kind of like a tightening but it also can be felt kind of like as a disconnection from others

239
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,120
or maybe even like a disconnection from ourselves

240
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:44,240
and as our practice deepens not only do we we become more sensitive but we also become more

241
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:50,080
motivated we start to see and experience and

242
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,600
acknowledge what's possible

243
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,400
as we start to touch into some areas that have more peace or start to have

244
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,720
greater understanding about ourselves or others then we feel more

245
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,279
motivated to not cause harm as the maybe the goodness that's inside

246
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:19,679
of us the goodness that's getting cultivated that's getting tapped into with a dharma practice

247
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:26,799
as this opportunity to get expressed in the way that we are showing up in the world

248
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,960
so we can also understand the dharma as something arises with our interactions with the world and

249
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,200
and with the harmlessness the way that we show up

250
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,880
not wanting to hurt or harm ourselves or others

251
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,480
maybe a third way that we can understand dharma is

252
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:03,120
kind of as a natural law or as a truth or as the way things are

253
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:13,360
and part of the natural thing or the way things are or

254
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:21,840
something that all humans experience if not all beings is a wish to be happy

255
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,480
i wish to have ease and peace and freedom

256
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,480
and certainly the dharma is about this

257
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,720
and so this wish to be happy gets supported by one of the

258
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,440
buddhist teachings about the bliss of blamelessness

259
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,039
of not harming others

260
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,799
and this knowing that we haven't intentionally caused any harm

261
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,799
gets expressed in this excerpt

262
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,399
one accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter with

263
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:20,399
regards to their ethical behavior so seeing no danger in any quarter that

264
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:26,559
means not in the north not in the east not into the west or not into the south

265
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,760
so the way they're talking just no danger anyway

266
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,440
instead they experience a blameless bliss that comes from maintaining this

267
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:44,399
noble virtue this feeling of safety if okay i haven't

268
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:50,720
done anything wrong and not only the safety but the

269
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,039
confidence that that gives to somebody

270
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:02,480
to know that you don't have regrets or if it comes forth that somebody

271
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,880
was harmed or something unfortunate happened as a consequence of your actions or something

272
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,840
you said or something you didn't do or didn't say

273
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,240
what a good feeling to know like oh okay that was certainly not my intentions

274
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:27,919
that was just i wasn't aware i didn't know i misunderstood whatever it might be

275
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:34,240
but this bliss of blamelessness kind of helps support the

276
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,278
dharma law of uh humans want to be happy

277
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:48,159
and also there's a one more quote here from the dhammapada

278
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:56,240
goes like this always awake are the disciples of the buddha

279
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,880
whose minds day and night delight in harmlessness

280
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,880
again this word is ahimsa so somebody is talking about

281
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:15,760
that the minds of those of the followers of the buddha are delighting in harmlessness

282
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,120
this kind of uplift that can happen that it knows when we're

283
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,720
not harming so what's really important about this is

284
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,080
this idea you know i'm talking about non-harming and the dharma

285
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,360
reading quotes from the nakayas and it could be

286
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,360
one way to interact with this which i think like okay i have to never cause harm and

287
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:49,840
if i do that means i'm a terrible person or something like this

288
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:58,240
it's so important that the manner in which we engage with these teachings be consistent with the teachings

289
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:06,559
it's not helpful for us to set up a impossible standard

290
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:12,960
and to chastise and beat ourselves up when we don't meet it that's not what the teachings are the

291
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,440
teachings are about being present for our life

292
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:26,559
being present for our experiences having that intention having the motivation to

293
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:33,600
not cause harm and when we discover that we have caused harm we

294
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:40,559
make amends we do what's appropriate and we go on to the next thing

295
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:47,360
we learn from it and we go on rather than carrying it around with us

296
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,760
and beating ourselves up that helps the that kind of carrying it

297
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,840
around and ruminating and getting stuck with

298
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,240
it there's a way that kind of doesn't allow us to learn what we need to learn

299
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,760
and move forward instead there's a way in which we get

300
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,279
stuck if we turn it into a story about being a

301
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:23,039
bad person or being inadequate or unable or something like this

302
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:31,120
but instead this harmlessness maybe another word we could say is good

303
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,640
will care warmth

304
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:43,679
kindness so can we have this for ourselves

305
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,279
and for others a key part of the buddha's teachings

306
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:54,960
right is this open-heartedness this warmth warm-heartedness

307
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,880
and certainly that's harmlessness let's care

308
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,240
so can we have that for ourselves as well as for others

309
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:13,600
i can have that for ourselves and it's the way that we're practicing the dharma

310
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:23,279
so no matter how we define the dharma it's whether it's the teachings

311
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:29,120
whether it's the way that we show up in the world whether or not as getting expressed

312
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:35,519
through humans in the world or whether it says kind of the natural laws and one of them is that people

313
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,840
beings want to be happy i tried to express it in terms of harmlessness maybe it was a little bit

314
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,760
of a stretch but in some ways how is it not

315
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,840
how is it not is the dharma as being in harmony

316
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,960
not in conflict with what is and with others

317
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:09,200
and in this way we can take refuge take refuge in the dramatic refuge and

318
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,358
not causing harm and may our doing so

319
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,560
be a support for not only our greater freedom but

320
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,679
for the freedom of all beings everywhere

321
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,919
thank you

322
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:44,800
so i'll stay up here for a few moments if somebody would like to ask questions otherwise i wish you all a really

323
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,838
