1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,399
well thank you and um so thank you Hillary for reminding me

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,480
about the dayong on

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,600
Saturday I did remember I haven't forgotten it but I didn't know the

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:26,679
time so I guess it's 8:30 to 5 you said so that so we um the last thing

5
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:34,920
that we were scheduled to do when the pandemic began was a day a day long here and uh I came

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,719
down early and made a sign and sat on the deck and said nope we're

7
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:47,920
closed so it kind of for me it comes in a full circle now it's been slightly

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,000
more than four years be four years and two weeks that uh since we had that canceled

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,399
day long so we're making up for it and if it is from 8:30 to 5:00 those are day

10
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,200
longs where um they're mostly silent through the day and uh I give a few

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,479
words at the beginning of the day and a talk at the end and I'm available for practice discussion through the day

12
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:16,680
there's a whole series of signups during the walking period so it's a kind of a a

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,040
wonderful opportunity to engage in your own practice in community in silence and

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,200
um when I do day longs from 9: to 4:30 those have uh guided meditation

15
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,360
instructions through the day so so that's so so you're all

16
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:39,079
welcome to come and I'm I'm certainly looking forward to starting them up

17
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:47,880
again so um the topic so I thought I would try to offer

18
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:55,759
you a meditator orientation to the sense of

19
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,600
self the sense of self is um is very

20
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,360
amorphous psychologists who use this uh term sometimes uh will some of the

21
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,920
definitions they give is like the collection of beliefs about the self some people go a little bit further to

22
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,480
say it's the they keep using the word collection the collection of personality

23
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,959
characteristics beliefs values Mor morality choices um you know some people go

24
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,519
further and say hormones and and uh thoughts and all kinds of things

25
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:43,400
come together but the important thing is that it's a collection so it's a amalgum of all

26
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,879
kinds of different things that are organized together to provide some amorphous sense of this is who I am this

27
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:56,280
is myself as a collection the uh The Collector the you

28
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,400
know collects things differently different context different situations ations our sense of shelf self can shift

29
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,720
over uh the Decades of a life sense of shelf self can shift over the minutes of

30
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,959
the day depending on the circumstance we find ourselves in the circumstance that

31
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,080
gather together that collect together what we need to get organized to meet

32
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,560
the situation that we're engaged in and so uh if this is the way we

33
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,560
understand that sense of self that it's a collection and that collection is collected different different ways and

34
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,200
different times then what happens in meditation and why meditation can be a

35
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,480
great uh kind of fascinating perspective on this is that the sense of uh that is

36
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,959
that uh as we relax and destress and calm down in meditation there's less of

37
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,400
this collecting going on there's less of this organizing things around this sense

38
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,879
of self or organizing particular way because some of the way we collect the mind collects not necessarily

39
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:09,000
consciously done is done uh as an activity an active forces in our

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,159
psychology in our mind and our body and our emotions they're they these are all

41
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,720
Marshall together to organize a a sense of

42
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,479
self but if some of those things have gotten quiet and still they're not

43
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:31,080
contributing to building that sense of self in that kind of way and um another

44
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,240
sense of kind of sense of self can arise because it's not using certain things so

45
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:45,080
for example I think one of the common organizing principles for a sense of

46
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,240
self is um uh

47
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,039
fear desire to protect and so we search around we look

48
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:03,280
inside we're organizing oursel in such a way to somehow help make ourselves feel

49
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,440
safe and some of those things can happen uh quite independent of any conscious

50
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:17,800
idea of who I am uh if um you know so it still happens so you I

51
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,919
don't know every two three times a year I think I'm hiking up in the hills here

52
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:30,160
and I see on the trail a twisted root of a tree or something and my first glass I

53
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,360
see a snake and uh and that first glance it isn't just seeing a snake there's a

54
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,880
physiological response in me for a moment physiological fear or concern

55
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,080
something gets activated and um and then I look at it long enough to see no it's not a it's

56
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,400
not a you know it's just a it's just a root that's looks like a snake a little

57
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,400
bit and um but there's been something's been activated

58
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,080
unconsciously without a choice to begin making myself safe being organized being

59
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,319
organized inside towards safety around the Snake once in Thailand I organized

60
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:18,800
myself much more dramatically when um uh I was in the

61
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,360
jungle and there was I don't know pretty wide dirt road I think a car could have

62
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,440
probably passed by and um and it was dust I couldn't see very well

63
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:36,120
and I had a you know film camera over with a strap strap over my shoulder

64
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,880
walking along and um and there was this Branch you know across the road and so I

65
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,840
stepped on the branch it wasn't a branch that was a

66
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:55,400
snake it was a big snake and so and so there was no you

67
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:03,000
know I something got organized something gathered together all kinds of MUSC and forces and things and I jumped in the

68
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,639
air spun in the air and threw the camera at the snake you know all that happened kind of

69
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:18,759
without planning it there was you know I didn't calculate or plan or she like but there was a tremendous amount of of

70
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:24,840
physiology and also probably some um algorithms that the brain has are

71
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:31,360
figuring out distance to the snake and direction of throwing and it's a phenomenon a complex event that happened

72
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,400
right there I wasn't I the usual idea of me was not

73
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,039
operating however we have us we have all this stuff that can get

74
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:47,520
triggered by the life we live that contributes then to this sense of self

75
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,039
and fear is one of them feeling wanting to be safe and what we search for and want when it's dramatic we talk about

76
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:59,520
fight and flight but when it's not so dramatic there are other things we do um

77
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,919
we search for protection some people search for the people who are going to keep us safe or the things that are going to keep us safe and and um and

78
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:12,280
there's orientation around what provides the safety we need and our sense of self

79
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:20,240
then gets very much tied to things maybe externally that this is what's going to keep me safe I need this safety I need

80
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,440
this so we start organizing ourselves um and uh the Buddha

81
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,839
emphasized how we organize this of self U collect the sense of self he he used

82
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:42,919
the word Kanda which these days translate as bundle how we bundle ourselves together

83
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:48,800
and um and uh but he also used the an analogy of a of a someone who sews a

84
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,600
tailor or a seamstress I think it's female seamstress in poly um is um that

85
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,079
is sewing together cloth or something and that's a metaphor of how desire is

86
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:09,760
the seamstress desires are sewing together the collection of things that we all want that to create the sense of

87
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,160
self the desire is as part of the collector and now say collect it but

88
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:22,160
it's sewing it together so it's that's the attachment the clinging to really keep it globed together

89
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:30,279
tight so um so it's easy in the course of the day to

90
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:38,440
be organized as our sense of self by what we're driven by by our desires what

91
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:47,959
we're consumed with what we're oriented towards this is important what I want to do and um and I should know better but I

92
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:54,040
see sometimes if I'm at home and I'm doing some my more research work and

93
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:02,360
writing and things like that um I kind of enjoy doing it but I get organized around that that and then if family come

94
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:09,040
and interrupts me it's like you know I get disoriented it's like you know

95
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,880
no you know because I have this momentum in this direction and so then I I see

96
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:22,959
that and then I okay I I to take a breath and let go and the family needs me now and and so but but the the force

97
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:31,320
is there momentum is there to do one thing and um when I was 14

98
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:39,000
uh I remember the momentum was uh to go through the entire phone book back back

99
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,040
then they had phone books and um uh which are people's names and then on the

100
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,360
on the left on the right there'd be the phone number but in between there'd be the

101
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:59,320
address and um uh I went through from the front my friend went through from the back because all we knew was the

102
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:06,000
girl's first name and the street she lived

103
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,399
on so we went to looked for all the streets the phone phone numbers heard

104
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:17,800
that street and then we called each number ask asking for

105
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:27,560
her so that's certain 14 that's a little bit of a you

106
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,279
know Drive to be organized

107
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:40,440
around and that was after having met her and for the first time in my life I

108
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:47,399
tried to light a cigarette to impress her which is also a kind of sense of

109
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:54,399
self what's important who you need to be right and um but I didn't really know

110
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,959
how so I failed so that was hard

111
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:06,519
so so um so I don't think that particular thing ever worked out for

112
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,600
me so um so you know so we organize ourselves what our choices what our

113
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,680
momentum what we're about in our life by all kinds of things and some of these forces are not

114
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:25,040
necessarily uh who would you know something we would even choose but it we feel the momentum the force and that

115
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:33,920
force of momentum of Desire or fear or anger or hostility or interest even is enough to

116
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,920
kind of help organize gather together all these other things for that purpose

117
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:48,199
and that force that momentum that forward goinging that desires that sews it together that collecting of things

118
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:54,920
that creates an amalgam of something can feel like it has a real thing it's like

119
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:02,240
this is who I am this is what I'm about right now but it's not but it can shift and

120
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:09,480
change uh about 10 years ago I had surgery and I took um pain medication

121
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,720
but I don't like taking pain medication so um I think I maybe took it for two

122
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,320
days and um which was Maybe not maybe it was maybe maybe not well I don't know if

123
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:27,079
it was long enough or not but uh I took it for two days and um and then I said

124
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:32,399
enough the next day uh I was still laying in bed recovering

125
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,199
from surgery and I had all these thoughts I said and

126
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:43,320
feelings I said well I'm really kind of going over the

127
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,920
hill you know in terms of my life cycle I'm on the way down to the

128
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,160
end my kids on their way up they were like you know they're just life is beginning for them they're their way up

129
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,759
it's exciting for them it's great and and I'm going down and there there's no point for me to do anything anymore and

130
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:09,040
it's you know it's the end you know and I don't know you know it's not really so great anymore and you know this is the

131
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:17,199
end and you know [Laughter] oh so uh so I called a friend of mine

132
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:25,639
and uh and told her what was going on and she said Gil that's the withdrawal from the pain

133
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:31,320
medication and I said oh okay so that made a big difference

134
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,519
for me I still had those feelings and those thoughts but I had I had glommed

135
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:42,120
onto it i' gotten identified by it my sense of self was defined by these

136
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,199
thoughts by these feelings I was having and all she had to do was say that's the

137
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:53,920
that's the withdrawal from medication and I didn't identify with it anymore it still went on it wasn't great but I

138
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,399
wasn't making a self out of it and sure enough within 24 hours it was back to

139
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:07,040
normal you know that was gone so uh I so I've known other people whove you know for medical reasons I've I've had

140
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,519
medication uh for things and um for different kinds of things and my

141
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,800
emotions my feelings my desires my drives all shift around the

142
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,560
medication I had one friend who um had uh for medical reasons was for a month

143
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:30,000
or so was given premature or medically induced menopause she was in her

144
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,519
30s and uh and she had this wonderful thing she said to me at one point she

145
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,959
said these thoughts I'm having are not me so she had the wisdom not to get

146
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:47,959
pulled in to what was going on she they were so bizarre so strange for her so she's oh this is not who I am and so

147
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:53,079
that made it easier for her to stay with it but you know this making a self this

148
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:59,519
is who I am is a sense of self this is who and it's hard not to when there's a

149
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,319
lot of authority a lot of force behind them you know so like when we're afraid

150
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:11,639
we everything gets organized around being taken care of ourselves but we never

151
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:17,759
question uh have we already before we are afraid what is it that is threat

152
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:26,639
threaten maybe we've already created a sense of self around something that's threaten so for example if uh

153
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,839
status it could be a uh our sense of self is related to how attractive we are

154
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:39,600
how smart we are who we know um where we live all kinds of things around uh you

155
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,920
know that becomes threaten I need those things to be socially accepted I need these things to fit in I need these

156
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,480
things to get into Old life old age and so we're we're there's something

157
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:57,319
there which is threatened can be threatened and we've already organized

158
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:02,360
why are we organized in certain particular way sometimes because of our life

159
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,079
experience uh life experiences can be quite difficult for people uh children

160
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,760
can grow up and what the message they get or gets how they get formed as a

161
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:21,160
person and their inner sense of who they are their sense of self it can be very much shaped by how their parents treat

162
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,880
them I see this regularly when people come to talk to me that how much that

163
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,400
people who uh weren't seen as children didn't feel loved there was no one there

164
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,039
to support them and guide them and mirror them and or when they or

165
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:46,600
sometimes when they did try to express their inner life to their parents or people around them um they were attacked

166
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,960
they were ashamed they were criticized people got angry and so they learned that they couldn't who they were

167
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,919
internally couldn't be expressed it was all about pleasing other people or making thems safe in relationship to

168
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:06,799
other people and everything the sense of self was all organized around what was external to make it just right or

169
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,520
something but maybe they never really had a chance to be see see themselves more deeply know themselves more deeply

170
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:19,679
their inner motivations their inner desires their inner values couldn't really had a chance to come forward

171
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,320
because they were not mirrored they had no place for it they were they were not affirmed they were not given positive

172
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:33,240
reinforcement around it and so the self then gets organized without those

173
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:41,720
things and some some therapists psychotherapists will spend a lot of time supporting people to discover who

174
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:48,640
they are by reconnecting themselves to their inner drives their inner emotions their inner

175
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:56,280
beliefs their inner sense of self and their inner ability to uh stand up for

176
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:03,200
themselves and so uh in my life life I remember I it was interesting in a particular phase of my practice when I

177
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,159
was a Zen student early years of Zen practice uh I was part of what I was

178
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:16,120
doing un unknown to me at the time it wasn't like I planned it or knew even knew it was happening was I was kind of

179
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,799
reorganizing and discovering my sense of self and and learning what was not

180
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:28,080
functional and what was functional what needed to happen around it to some degree and uh and some of the things

181
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,200
that happened we kind of it could be described as geometrically opposed to each other what I was trying to do but

182
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,280
that's because a sense of self is multifaceted we don't have just one sense of self that we organize ourselves

183
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:46,880
around it's contextual it shifts and changes so almost at exactly the same

184
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:54,400
time um uh in a range of time about year or two uh I had

185
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:03,080
um um I was living at uh the Frisco Zen Center living in a place where the big

186
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:10,559
ethos dedication of the place is to live for the welfare and happiness of the world the idea is to be a bodh satva

187
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,840
that really there to serve the world and even to put off put off your own Awakening until everybody else is

188
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,799
awakened first so to be of service and um and so the Zen Center

189
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:29,919
would ask for lots of service we lived there I was monk that you know kind of vows of poverty and Serv and obedience

190
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,919
kind of and so whatever they asked me to do I did but institutions don't usually

191
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:44,640
say no for people and uh at some point I was working uh full-time for five and a half

192
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,440
days a week Monday through half day Saturday and then I on on Sunday I had

193
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:57,600
to take this big buffer and buffer all the floors at Z Center and wait a minute that was my day

194
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,760
off so I I did that for a while and I said wait a minute no one here is going to say no for

195
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:10,400
me and it was a little hard it was hard for me to say know because it was like a great world religion you who might have

196
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,559
stand up to that my little Gil stand up to you know

197
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:24,039
Buddhism and um and so but at some point I said no this doesn't make sense I have to stand up and say no this is and so

198
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:31,520
that was a that was a kind of important step of asserting myself because I didn't know I could it was even bigger a

199
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,799
couple of years later maybe a year and a year or so year later when I went to practice in

200
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:44,720
Japan and and there I went back to like to the Mother Temple like the one of the where you know the heart of Zen budhism

201
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:52,279
which in my big my little mind little kid mind was you know again this huge authority figure Father Figure maybe and

202
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:57,760
there was all right that I had to you know obey or something and uh and I was

203
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,320
uh set up to be there for a for in the monastery for 5 months an intensive

204
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:10,960
Retreat time and about halfway through I realized this is not the right place for me this is not this is not working and

205
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:18,279
it's not right and and um and who am I to say that's not right you know and you're not supposed to leave in the

206
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:24,320
middle and so um no no I know this would came really clear I

207
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,039
know and so this is not right for me and and it doesn't make sense for me to stay stay and I have to be able to now stand

208
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:35,919
up for myself and say no and leave and that was a huge growth for me to assert

209
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:42,159
myself to be have that ability to stand up and know what I needed to do so that's a kind of sense of self to

210
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,559
understand oneself well enough and make that kind of choice and then the amazing thing

211
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:52,640
happened I made this decision completely clear I had no doubt about it I knew it

212
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,559
was a milestone and that allowed something else to happen then I decided to

213
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:06,360
stay but not for my sake there had been a Japanese monk who had sponsored me at

214
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:13,679
the monastery and I knew that if I left his reputation in his religious community in

215
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:21,039
Japan would be maybe destroyed it was a huge deal so when I realized that after I

216
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,400
decided I would go but I'd already made this decision and change but then I didn't

217
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,600
have to go anymore and I stayed PA for his sake I didn't want to have that

218
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,679
impact on him so it's almost like I became stronger as a person and now with

219
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:43,000
that strength I could use it to for the benefit of someone else and you know and

220
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:51,320
put aside my own benefit in a certain degree the work that needed to be done had been done at the same time that was going

221
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,880
on I had this very clear sense that there was an attachment to self within

222
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,880
me and I could feel that that had to let go that clinging had to let go but I had

223
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:09,400
no idea how to do it in fact I was afraid to do it because it felt like if

224
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:15,760
I let go of that I'm going to fall into a great Abyss that's literally how it felt I mean I couldn't see I didn't see

225
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:23,960
any Abyss but that's that's how I kind of felt and um and so I knew that that was

226
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,360
something I had to do and but I didn't know how so I went went along and I went

227
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,640
along and then eventually I kind of made a ritual for myself that when I go my

228
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,039
second time to Asia to practice um that trip there will be that ritual now I'm

229
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:47,880
going to let go I never saw it let go but what I saw was that after a period

230
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,200
of deep meditation long meditation Retreats that that sense of attachment

231
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,399
no longer was there there was still a sense of self

232
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:04,200
but it was not being sewn together by this sense of self by by by this uh

233
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,240
desire this attachments I had there was a freedom that happened

234
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,480
there so when we meditate it's not just about becoming

235
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,440
stressfree and becoming calm many in the public mind in the United States I think a lot of people think of meditation for

236
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:29,080
the purposes of stress reduction the stress reduction for us in our practice is the beginning of a

237
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:35,799
deeper investigation if you can get quiet and still and release a lot of the stress we

238
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:41,240
have what we're doing simultaneously is we're pu putting to

239
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,600
rest for a while some of the different forces some of the different activities

240
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:53,880
that going on inside of us that collects that sense of self together and so the sense of self begins

241
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:00,240
to soften begins to shift begins to be quiet

242
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,919
and uh and it might actually change a lot some people's sense of self changes

243
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:13,640
dramatically through meditation because they prefer the sense of self they have when they meditate than when they're not

244
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:20,399
meditating and for some people the dissonance between who they think feel they are when they meditate and who they

245
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:25,679
are in the active busy world is so radically different that it's it's it's

246
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:32,360
confusing it's challenging it's it's it's you know something and it was for

247
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:39,440
me a little bit when I first first started meditating regularly um every

248
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,399
day let's see I yeah so I I did probably was doing it for maybe about nine months

249
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:50,880
or something and then I went to live on a small farm uh and so every morning I got I got

250
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,240
up to meditate before you know before we went to breakfast and um and I was living with

251
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:03,120
friends and um but how I was coming out of my

252
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:11,000
meditation it's like Gil wasn't there like I was peaceful I was calm I was content but the the social Gill the one

253
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,360
who played social games and you know we you know one way or other we're playing

254
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:22,000
social games often when we're talking with people with my friends and going along with what they want and they with

255
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,480
me and praising and excitement and something that wasn't operating so I'd

256
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,279
sit at breakfast kind of content and quiet and I could feel after a few days of this after a

257
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:39,679
while I have to make a choice here either I stop meditating or I'm

258
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,799
going to lose my friends and I gave up meditation because

259
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:50,200
I wanted my friends I wanted I wanted to have Harmony there I wanted to work well there and I didn't know how to make it I

260
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,519
didn't know how to make it work at that point in my life later I learned how to do

261
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:03,960
that and um so to sit and meditate and feel the mind the body get

262
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,480
calmer more settled to feel the stress go away to feel certain degree of relief

263
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:18,279
of Peace quieting maybe even some Stillness that is a a vantage

264
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:24,840
point from which to begin being curious about what is it that we're

265
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:32,080
gathering together what are we sewing together to make this the sense of self it might be that as you come out of

266
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,720
meditation you you're now you can start seeing what's happening what you're what's what you're

267
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,120
what you're Gathering Together what's happening maybe not right away when you come out of meditation but maybe later

268
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:49,720
in the day you see wait a minute I'm back to business as usual and now I in

269
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,519
the past I thought this was this was like the fish can't see the water it's swimming in they say I don't know if

270
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,840
it's true but uh that's what they say and um

271
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:08,080
but uh so we don't see the concept of self that we swim in they're so taken

272
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:15,799
for granted some people have chronic anxi anxiety chronic fear don't know they

273
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:22,720
have it I can't tell you how many people I've known have come on a Meditation Retreat where you're they're sitting

274
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:30,480
long enough to get quieter and quieter where they're watching their mind continuously more and over over and they

275
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,399
discover wow my fear is pervasive I have no idea

276
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,799
how pervasive it was always there operating so people we can have these

277
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:48,240
forces that organize us that drive us to how we live our life but that we don't

278
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:55,039
not so conscious of them and so that's one of so as we get quieter and quieter and those things go

279
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:01,559
to for rest for a rest then we have a a contrast by which to see them more

280
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:07,200
clearly by and we say oh fear organizes my life

281
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,760
desires organize my life um shame organized my life H

282
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,880
hostility organizes my life and these emotions are quite

283
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:25,480
deep they are so deep it's kind of like the fear I had with a snake that you

284
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,960
know it's more instinctual than anything that was consciously done when I swirled

285
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,200
in the air and threw that camera down some of these Deep Emotions like shame

286
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,840
and desires and fears and anger

287
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:49,679
hostility they operate in very deep forces within us sometimes we don't even know how much they're

288
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,559
there but they are the the kind of organizing principles the magnets around

289
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:01,760
which other things are gathered but when fear quiets down anger quiets

290
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:09,039
down shame quiets down Desir is quiet down we see well we

291
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,399
see that they're optional we see that they're not inherent they're not always

292
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:20,639
operating and there can be start starting to be an idea maybe I don't

293
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:26,440
have to believe them maybe I don't have to make a self out of them maybe I don't

294
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:33,240
identify them and have have those Define who I am just like just when my friend said

295
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:40,760
that's the withdrawal you're going through I loosened up I lightened up around my thoughts and my

296
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:47,159
emotions I didn't realize how much I had organized myself tightly around those thoughts tightly around those

297
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:52,639
emotions oh look at that look at that and there's an opening there's a

298
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:58,039
relaxing there's a seeing and the possibility comes that

299
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:05,519
one day and I'm saying this to make you curious because curiosity sometimes is a

300
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:14,960
opens doors is a day will come when you

301
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:22,039
observe the sense of self observe the operating principles that are driving

302
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:28,559
something inside of you you observe it

303
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:36,639
from a place of Silence a silent place where there's

304
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:42,919
nonverbal knowing that's independent free from

305
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:50,240
what those thoughts beliefs sense of self is say wow look at that there's a

306
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:59,240
sense of self you don't say there is my sense of self thank you I'm going to keep it

307
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:05,519
and you better learn what it is I'm going to prove it to you who I am no oh

308
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:14,519
it's a a sense of self look at that and it's known from a place of Stillness of calm

309
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:20,120
of Peace that's independent from what is being

310
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:30,240
seen some people then will identify with that still quiet awareness that's the

311
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,159
self and that's pretty common that's true who I really am and uh when I came

312
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:43,760
to my Buddhist teacher and said that to him said well you know everything else is not me but this awareness is me he

313
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:51,799
just smiled and said just keep looking and sure enough at some point

314
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:57,399
that also disappeared and I saw oh that's not Al Al that also is not self

315
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:04,159
that's just you know that's just observing let it be just observing and

316
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:12,480
um so so to use meditation not only to become calm and

317
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:22,158
peaceful but to you see that whatever degree of calm and peace you can reach that that gives you a new way of

318
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,240
understanding what makes you operate what your operating principles are what

319
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:34,440
the progam programs are that you're operating on that gathers together organizes itself into this is who I

320
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,638
am and you'll start seeing that this your sense of self is actually shifting

321
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:47,358
and changing all the time some of them sometimes they they get solidified fossilized frozen into a

322
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:53,358
particular one but to some degree it's shifting and

323
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:59,079
changing sometimes I think of it's like the water that takes the shape of whatever contain you poured into the

324
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:04,560
water into so that we have all these different we gather gather all these different

325
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:12,200
things into a container and so something takes that

326
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:19,720
shape and um the Buddha sometimes refer to this as a clay pot that a Potter has

327
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,760
made and the B Gathering Together the bundling of all this

328
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:32,040
stuff and when we're enlightened then the the pottery

329
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:38,520
shards the metaphor shifts from where in that we know who we are is inside this

330
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:45,760
pot and defined by it limited by it uh the imagery changes to image of a very

331
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,359
clear Mountain Lake that the person on person who can

332
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,040
see clearly um good eyesight can stand on the edge of the little Lake and see

333
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,599
right down to the the bottom of the lake it's so clear and in the on the floor

334
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:11,200
bottom there are Pottery Pottery shards and now the the

335
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:17,880
water is the container for the shards rather than the pot being the

336
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:26,240
container for the water so exactly what the water supposed to be in this metaphor is uh you know

337
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,800
it's up for grabs but uh you know it could be your

338
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,960
awareness and what we're trying to do in Buddhism is is to set awareness

339
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,319
free and what What's Left Behind maybe it's kind of I don't know

340
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:48,079
if you like this metaphor but the shards the broken shards the the

341
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,920
solidified ways in which we limit ourselves by our sense of self I think

342
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:00,119
the sense of self is always can be a limiting Force but not

343
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:06,079
always doesn't have to be and from a from a therapeutic point of view people

344
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:13,400
who use therapists who use the sense of self they they they talk a lot about creating a strong sense of

345
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:20,280
self that um when I said no to Zen Buddhism I I was developing a stronger

346
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,160
sense of self people who become mature in this practice develop what a

347
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,800
therapist would call a very strong sense of self uh they know who they are they know

348
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,920
who they are in relation with other people they know how to take care of themselves stand up for themselves they

349
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:42,000
know to they know what they've attained they know what their inner life is like

350
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,839
all the things that the therapist wants to see for a strong sense of self they

351
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:53,720
have no problem but it's it's not inside of a

352
00:37:53,720 --> 00:38:00,160
clay pot The Clay Pot is inside of awareness

353
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:07,440
set free so I hope that this talk one of the

354
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,599
purposes I gave it which I said was hope to hope to give you some

355
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:23,318
curiosity about what it might be like for you to observe your sense of

356
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,359
self from a still silent place

357
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,920
inside and maybe you don't have that place yet but maybe you can have

358
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,520
intimations of it and maybe from that still quiet

359
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:51,160
place where there can be nonverbal knowing how do you know what happens

360
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:58,240
when you know and watch the the a the

361
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:06,760
senses of self as they roll through your life and can you become free of

362
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,680
it shattering The Clay

363
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,680
Pot so those are my thoughts and um

364
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,400
maybe we have a few minutes this is a kind of talk that either we just be

365
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,720
quiet about and just not say anything and live with

366
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,000
or you have got questions and concerns and

367
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:43,400
protests they're all invited so anybody want to have anything they want to ask or say and Martha in the in the

368
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,000
back the idea of nonself or non attach the idea of nonself or nonattachment to

369
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,640
self is probably the most confusing Concept in Buddhism to me at this point in my

370
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:10,240
life did I mention that during this talk well did I incorrectly infer I don't think I me said anything about that okay

371
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,560
I heard the part about attachment but is attachment and and self the same thing for you no no

372
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,640
attachment to a sense of self right oh but that's not then if so there can be

373
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:29,400
nonattachment to a sense of self okay now you're just confusing me

374
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,720
so for you self sense of self and attachment are always go

375
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,160
together it seems that's where I'm at oh fantastic you're in the right place

376
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:52,200
then keep looking okay but I have a question about

377
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:58,640
how I deal with other people's projections of me oh yes so so I'm often

378
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:06,000
the only woman in a group of businessmen uhhuh and there's a certain

379
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,599
tendency that I that I experience that they underestimate me and I notice that

380
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,359
drains some of my energy yes and then there's the experiences where I'm in a

381
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,560
group of people where my work has been very beneficial to them and there's

382
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,599
agulation and that feels even worse which surprised me because that only

383
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:37,119
came late in life yes and then there's the moments when I'm with someone we're engaging on what feels a really

384
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,720
authentic level um and I'm talking about things regarding my

385
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,880
work um and I gain energy from that I also gain useful connections new ideas

386
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:56,040
things that help me build what I'm building now um and I'm trying to understand those projections in terms of

387
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:02,319
this idea of the sense of self yeah what are they and how do I deal with them yeah well I think there's always going

388
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:08,119
to be projections so they're not going to go away and the question is can we

389
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:14,079
mean what just talked about is complicated to talk it's the whole ecosystem you've talked about and I

390
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:21,160
brought it up the E ecosystem of self it's so so many different parameters and issues going on and they shift the sense

391
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:27,240
of self shifts in different contexts different situations and that's part of both the charm and the and the

392
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,440
wonderfulness of the sense of self when it's free enough to shift and change depending on

393
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:38,760
circumstances and uh it's also part of the challenge because how can we keep up with all the changes and how can we

394
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:46,800
manage the different ones where we find ourselves in but this is where if we could develop um uh I think one of the

395
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,920
things we want to develop in this practice is a lot of confidence a lot of confidence in just

396
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,200
being alive and present and clear confident that we can speak up in the

397
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:03,760
necessary confident we can say no U maybe can't do it verbally out loud to the people there but we know inside of

398
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:09,440
ourselves that we can make the right choices uh to take care of ourselves to

399
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:16,000
slow things down or step away or you know and um we're confident enough that

400
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,720
we can uh deal with the problems if we just walk away from something get too

401
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:27,960
difficult for us and they not worried about being homeless because we're confident enough that even homeless we

402
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,960
can take our ground and be present so there's a phenomenal it's possible to cultivate a

403
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,079
confidence in oneself we that we carry with us into all these difficult and

404
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:45,319
complicated places so that we don't become um victims of the projections we

405
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:51,880
don't get pushed around by them we don't believe them we don't depend on them um

406
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:58,240
and uh so so that's my best answer in this short time I don't I think it's inadequate I want to respect what you

407
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,760
said and and a lot of people here in this room how difficult this is for to

408
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,559
navigate um but if we can do this work in meditation to use it to see not just

409
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:14,839
to if we just distress if we end up oh I'm so stressful this life of mine and

410
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:22,119
then we go back the next day and the Dynamics haven't changed then we need to recover again we keep recovering but if

411
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:28,839
we have we start understanding what get calm enough and quiet enough we can start seeing what is operating there and

412
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:36,319
what sense of self what what how am I organizing myself when I go into a business meeting what self am I

413
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:43,280
bringing and that's when I bring the fear self and so I'm looking and organizing myself in a certain way when

414
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,520
I'm going to the meeting where I'm the boss I'm organizing myself and now very

415
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:55,480
differently and there's choices being made subconsciously and consciously about how to present ourselves how we're

416
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:02,640
going to be who we're going to be so what we want to do with this practice is to and I can't answer all the

417
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:10,000
questions for anybody about how they should be with all these different situations but uh we make a huge Headway

418
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,440
if we start being able to observe our own sense of self and it shifting changing nature and the choices

419
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,680
behind it and the emotions the beliefs the all these different traits that come

420
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,240
come into play as we bundle together organize together collect together the

421
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:32,440
sense of self that okay for now yeah awareness

422
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,480
and confidence I mean to to distill it yeah those two things could take you a

423
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,880
long way I can definitely work with that thank

424
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:52,640
you someone else we do one more here in the front

425
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:58,920
can wait for the mic please

426
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:06,240
and then what you want to do is you want to hold it yeah like this okay um yeah so you talked about fear as sort of

427
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:12,599
creating a sense of self and just now you talked about um I guess what I

428
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:19,400
reflect is like the up and down nature of you know maybe getting better and like okay saying all right put my fear

429
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:26,720
aside and then feel better but then going back down and then fear again kind of creating a sense of self I don't know

430
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:33,119
if you can talk about how to you know not have this up and down

431
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:41,200
uhhuh I think that the uh the the orientation with with this mindfulness practice we do is to see it clearly to

432
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,359
really see the pattern to see it operating see how it operates to see uh

433
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:54,079
the uh the beliefs to see the emotions to see the drives to see the organizing

434
00:46:54,079 --> 00:47:01,040
principles uh of how we what what are we getting caught in what are we getting attached to and what are we picking

435
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,920
up rather than thinking that fear is somehow inherently the right way to be

436
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,599
in any situation it's possible that uh we haven't we want to look observe our

437
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:18,040
fear in a deep way the fear might need us and until we understand the fear in a

438
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:23,880
deep way um or bring a lot of attention to it uh it's always going to be there

439
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:29,559
grabbing us when the the situation arises and there's two primary things right now

440
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:36,960
that I can think of with fear one is that um uh to find the have the fear our

441
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:45,280
tendency to fear to um thaw and relax in some very very deep way that uh and then

442
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:51,040
to that's one thing and the other thing is to understand why do we pick up the

443
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:57,960
fear why do we believe the fear and and if you can do those two

444
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:04,599
things you'll go a long way to understand what your ups and downs are about how does that

445
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:10,160
