groups in the chat where folks can join share information with one another

resources are shared there and at this point i change the settings

29
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,960
so that accidental unmuting won't be possible so that we can have

30
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,639
some pride in the space silence of the space and and also chat will be

31
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,160
quiet for this period and i'll open it up again

32
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:53,520

so hello and welcome to happier everyone

35
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:13,680
lovely to be with you so for today's practice

36
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,080
i've been wanting to um to touch in and reconnect with the

37
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,680
question that came up last time uh

38
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,759
about last friday last thursday last last wednesday anyway

39
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,400
um and fred asked a question about uh tinnitus or tinnitus

40
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,639
ringing in the ear and other people expressed appreciation for

41
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,800
that question and follow-up and also there was follow-up on in

42
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,039
the google groups about that question so we wanted to actually dedicate um

43
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:03,840
this this sitting this practice to um

44
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:11,919
this to the idea of something challenging arising something challenging arising

45
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:18,400
and and perhaps expand on the answer for the on the invitations i was giving that

46
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,680
night and to actually invite all of us to practice because whether or not

47
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,479
we have something physical let's say very specifically was brought up as tinnitus

48
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:38,319
ringing in the ear that can show up as very unpleasant and and as a distraction etc

49
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:47,440
but it can also be pain in the body discomfort in the body

50
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,000
any pain any discomfort any headache any back ache anything

51
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,280
but even more generally this can be anything that

52
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,759
we don't want to be present in our bodies uh in our mind

53
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,319
or in our heart in our emotional space or in our lives

54
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,160
anything that's that's unpleasant so so

55
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:25,520
if you don't have tinnitus or or pain in the body please consider these invitations i'm about to give

56
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,960
and the way to work with them specifically as we'll enter in a moment

57
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:38,000
for anything that is happening in your body in your life

58
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,720
that is unpleasant that you consider to be unpleasant you consider

59
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,400
a sense of you don't want it to be here you don't want it to be here it's unpleasant you don't want it to be here

60
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,599
so so all of us i trust being human beings

61
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,360
we have something we can relate to um in this way in our life so that can be a

62
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,199
general practice for everyone so so i'll say a couple of words and then

63
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,560
we'll practice with it more more more extendedly

64
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,520
but something to consider is that um when there is

65
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,199
pain discomfort something unpleasant there is the thing itself there is the

66
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,319
thing itself whatever it is the event the happening the pain the

67
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:37,919
sound etc there's the thing itself and then separate and then as we

68
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,200
quiet our minds as we settle as we will do in our meditation in the moment will

69
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,880
take time to settle you'll notice that yes there is the thing itself

70
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,560
and separate from the thing itself is

71
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:02,000
aversion to it actually separate from the thing itself first i want to say is the unpleasant

72
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,080
feeling tone there's the unpleasant feeling tone that this is unpleasant this is

73
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,080
unpleasant and we can recognize that to be separate when we quiet our minds but

74
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,880
it is separate and again separate from the thing itself

75
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,800
from the feeling tone number two separate from these two the

76
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,279
third is in is a reaction that comes up it's a

77
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:40,080
reaction that comes up which is pushing away there is i don't like this

78
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,200
i don't want this make it go away there's a resistance there's a pushing

79
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:53,440
away there's aversion there's this pressing of the aversion okay

80
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,880
so three different things the thing itself the vedana or feeling tone in politics

81
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,800
veda the feeling tone which in this case happens to be unpleasant but please know

82
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,720
that the feeling tone is separate so the same sound the same

83
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,240
feeling sensation actually seen from a different light at times

84
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,839
could have a neutral or even a pleasant feeling tone so

85
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,360
this is not a function of the object itself of the thing itself it's an

86
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:38,880
object it's it's a function of the way we see of the mind which is more subtle so

87
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:45,839
it's okay if you're like oh i don't get that it's okay but i do want to bring it in you don't have to force believe this

88
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:52,399
just know that the feeling tone is very flexible it's really flexible

89
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:59,279
it really amazes us when we see that and then the third that aversion the

90
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,880
pushing away the make it go away i don't like this which really comes up not from

91
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,160
the thing itself but really from the impact that the way

92
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:18,800
we perceive unpleasant habitually we're human beings we all do that but the reaction to unpleasant tends to

93
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,240
be make it go away aversion and it's really that aversion the

94
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,800
pushing away that both keeps all of this in place and also

95
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:38,240
causes the pain the suffering now as as you've all heard by now

96
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,680
pain is inevitable suffering is optional so if you think of the thing and the

97
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,800
as as the pain as the you know physical pain for example as the first object the

98
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:58,560
suffering is that pressing it's that rejection which really holds it in place okay

99
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,680
so so so in tonight's in practice as a part of

100
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,800
happier i like to invite you and i could again could be a sensation pain it could be

101
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,480
something in your life which is like this is unpleasant i don't like this make it go away

102
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,680
will notice all these parts and then the invitation is

103
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,959
what if there is an acceptance of the rejection because sometimes the rejection it it

104
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,560
gets fixed in the whole the whole nine yards this whole

105
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:40,160
uh you know all these pieces becomes a vicious cycle it gets hooked as it

106
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,920
becomes a dam as if you have a dam that that you know the flow of water gets

107
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,240
kind of gets um stopped the dam that's built up is from that

108
00:12:52,240 --> 00:13:00,240
aversion from that pushing back so if we ah accept open up open up viscerally

109
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:08,240
feeling and again i'll give specific invitations but just opening yourself up to that feeling into opening into

110
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,959
relaxing into giving space

111
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,160
for this aversion

112
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:27,519
that relaxing can actually open up the latch of the dam and the water can flow

113
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,720
water can flow in the way that the object may still be there the

114
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:39,519
sensation the pain the whatever it is in your life the unpleasantness may or may not be

115
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,639
there it might still feel unpresent it may not feel as unpleasant as it once did

116
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:53,360
but this sense of suffering pain distraction that it's providing

117
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,839
that goes away so this thing whatever it is it can still be here it can still be

118
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:06,800
present but without taking so much energy without taking so much

119
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:14,480
ah energy to push it away it just is it's just the part of so many

120
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,120
other stimuli or so many other things that are happening in life so

121
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:28,320
um [Music] and as to how it relates to mental and warmth and friendliness

122
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,240
really the it is a way of cultivating friendliness and kindness towards ourselves to see

123
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,639
all these relationships and open to what arises with just a little more

124
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,680
receptivity kindness patience

125
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,000
so i have spoken plenty tonight to set up this structure

126
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:00,240
hope it's been helpful let's meditate together let's let's land

127
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,399
ah let's land

128
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,480
let's arrive let's land in our bodies

129
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,760
and let's just arrive take time

130
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:36,360
letting go of all the words whatever has come before this

131
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:50,079
letting go letting go letting go letting go

132
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:57,040
oh letting go some more just here

133
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,519
just simple

134
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,680
feeling this body connected to the earth

135
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:27,000
through our feet our legs our bottom on the cushion

136
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,880
landing relaxing into this body

137
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,160
to the chair

138
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,839
the cushion

139
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:08,360
taking refuge with each breath

140
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,280
and if you find thoughts and memories arise it's

141
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,840
okay smiling smiling at them

142
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,200

i'm just giving myself wholeheartedly right now

144
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,840
this is practice of here being here now settling

145
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,480
with the simplicity of the breath

146
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,440
in the body in this moment

147
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,039

152
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,160
calming like a lullaby

153
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:32,559
tilling the soil tilling the soil calm awareness

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,360
in the abdomen

160
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:39,840
instead of breathing in kindness breathing out kindness and gentleness

161
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:49,679
into this body into this heart and mind

162
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,840
not letting the breath be work

163
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,320
in fact breathing has been happening all this time

164
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:17,760
so let breathing happen naturally

165
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,360
just as it has been

166
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:29,840

167
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,440
the belly area i know it's happening

168
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:46,679
breathing is happening on its own how nice

169
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:05,200
as if awareness was receiving a gift didn't have to work for it

170
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:14,080
you could relax relax just receive the gift of each in-breath and out-breath

171

smilingly

172
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,080

as you continue to breathe with

193
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,840
whatever is happening the sense of something

194
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,840
in your life in your body as discussed earlier where there is

195
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,080
some rejection there's pushing away there's aversion

196
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,200
maybe it's a pain in your body ringing in your ear

197
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,320
or something in your life

198
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:58,840
and let yourself feel into the contraction to this energy of pushing away not

199
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,640
wanting resisting hating

200
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,480
let yourself really know it

201
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,278
as if you're a scientist of your own mind heart

202
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:41,519
scientists are curious they don't judge they're just curious about phenomena

203
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:47,600
so too be curious about this not liking

204
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:55,240
i wish it weren't here make it go away feeling

205
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,200
where do you feel it in the body this aversion is it the tightness in

206
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:10,399
your chest and your belly somewhere else

207
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,720

208
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,240

209
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,880
this tightening this not wanting it to be here see if there are extra layers

210
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,039
of aversion not wanting it to be here and if so

211
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:40,240
bring gentle loving curiosity to that

212
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,720
and see if that's the case and if you bring curiosity

213
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:59,159
a sense of spacious open open inquiry non-judgmental

214
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:09,599

215
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:17,760
if if that opens up ah it feels a little more spacious

216

feel feel is pushing away if it's still here

224
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,760
what if you allowed it to be here this tightness

225
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,680
this aversion completely this tightness

226
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,520
maybe it shows up in your belly your chest however it shows up physically this

227
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,760
aversion the sound to the pain to

228
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:47,359
something in your life you don't want it to be here what if you let it the aversion be here it's okay

229
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,200

230
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,560
okay all right you can be here

231
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:10,720
plenty of other things that can be here it can be joy there can be ease it can be sensations on my feet

232
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,960
and you too you can be here too

233
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,160
dear not or whatever it is

234
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:38,440
there's plenty of space here in the sphere of awareness

235
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,720
for everything to be here

236
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,680
without the aversion sucking the air out of everything

237
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:00,320
doesn't have to if we don't give it primacy if we don't make it the focus just

238
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:06,000
acknowledging it's here yeah it can be here we don't try to push it away give it all

239
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,240
our energy

240
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,800
it's as if the giant what was once this scary giant

241
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,920
oh it becomes tiny small it's still here

242
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,160
but it's not so threatening anymore

243
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:48,040
just space around it breathe around it

244
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,560
hold it take your time

245
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:13,040
give it a lot of space not trying to push it to go away

246
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:20,000
not at all relax your body

247
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,960
relax your body

248
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:45,960
there's plenty of space for comfort for ease

249
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,920
sensations that are pleasant

250
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,078
awareness being so spacious like the sky

251
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:11,640
holding the body the breath and this too this can be here

252
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:33,359
this next step might take some time you can try it on tonight if you like

253
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:41,280
but maybe later in your own time and maybe you are ready to check in and see if

254
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:48,560
the original pain ringing in the ears or issue in your life if there is more ease

255
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,160
around that now that the aversion to it

256
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,838
there's more ease around

257
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,040
there's more ease that too this too can be here more

258
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:17,119
more easily it's not central stage anymore

259
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,800
and if bringing awareness directly to it brings up the unpleasantness and brings

260
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,880
up the aversion it's okay go back to the inversion

261
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:40,240
make a lot of space for the origin it's okay it's okay

262
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:48,000
breathe with it breathe around it relax relax your heart

263
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,520
relax your heart dear heart dear heart

264
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,319
dear heart you can hold so much to your heart

265
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,520
dear courageous compassionate heart

266
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:33,680
they need to go back and forth a few times or bring awareness more spaciously to

267
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,680
your feet to your hands ah

268
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:49,839
the space of kindness you're sitting in that can hold this all hold it up

269
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,560
hold all that arises and passes away

270
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:01,680
stimulus in our life and our body

271
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:09,280
whatever phenomenon it is unpleasantness that the mind

272
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:17,838
labels it as and any aversion which may come and go

273
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,880
this heart this body this mind is so spacious

274
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:41,640
and for the last moments of this practice holding yourself spaciously lovingly

275
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,480
for whatever arose or did not arrive during this practice period it's all okay

276
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,520
it's all okay

277
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,119
give it all the causes and conditions it had to be exactly as it was

278
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:11,960
or it would have been different appreciating yourself thanking yourself

279
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:21,760
offering the goodness of your practice to yourself and to all beings everywhere

280
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:29,240
may all beings be free including myself

281
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,920
thank you thank you for your practice

282
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,560
ah so

283
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,760
there's a lot that can come up with this practice so what we did is we started by

284
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:08,400
settling arriving feeling embodied with kind awareness

285
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:15,359
and we brought into our awareness something some phenomena in our body in our life

286
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:20,480
that's challenging and then i invited you

287
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,319
to notice the aversion to the unpleasantness that's associated with

288
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:34,400
this phenomena and we worked mainly with making space with for the

289
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:41,520
aversion which is this pushing is making it go away that this this dam that keeps it in

290
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:48,400
place noticing if there's a vern version on top of the version oh i don't like this

291
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,599
it's like i don't like this tightness in my chest that i don't like the fact that i have this thing like okay all right

292
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,720
can we can we bring acceptance spaciousness to that

293
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:05,280
and noticing if that allows some softening in the mind and the heart

294
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:11,599
and noticing if the phenomena itself there's more space for it to be

295
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,640
at times and if you notice okay if that for some

296
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:22,720
brings more um more aversion again okay going back to the vision so going back and forth and

297
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,800
over time really working with giving space giving a lot of space because when we just

298
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:37,440
narrow our mind to what is not working what is challenging what is difficult it feels like we bring it into our face

299
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,839
and that's the only thing we see there is no space to breathe at all it just sucks the air out of the room whereas oh

300
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:50,000
there's so much space oh my feet feel pleasant and this it's all okay and we realize there's so much more space for

301
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,520
this thing to be just as it is just as it is it becomes a practice

302
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:01,200
and over time there can be a sense of working through

303
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:08,720
layers of acceptance more and more and more and more so if radical acceptance

304
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:14,960
doesn't happen with this short meditation it's okay don't expect it it might have hallelujah great i'd love to

305
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,960
hear about it and and yet be patient be patient with yourself

306
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:27,280
more and more layers of acceptance will happen more and more and more and more

307
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:33,839
and more and the time at time the time might come where there's a subtle

308
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:40,880
um aversion still pushing away is there and when the question comes you can ask

309
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,880
yourself well am i gonna be okay if this thing this pain this situation never goes away

310
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:54,839
and at that point if the answer is yeah there's enough space that i will be okay there's okayness there is

311
00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:00,240
okayness and this thing can be there that's the feels like the final layer of

312
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,880
acceptance and then it'll stop bothering us you can still be there i had this

313
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:13,359
experience years and years ago i'll share with you with as you know i have a chronic illness and a lot of body pain

314
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:18,720
and which i've had for years and years and i was i've been practicing

315
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:27,440
with it for a long time years ago i was practicing i felt like i had accepted yes pain i can be with pain yes

316
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:34,079
unpleasantness i see the unpleasantness and actually stopped being unpleasant after a while it can the unpleasantness

317
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:40,079
can shift to actually be neutral or even be pleasant at times which is wild that's another

318
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:45,920
uh i'll leave that to decide for a moment on a post-it note proverbial person note

319
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:52,640
but uh but the time came where i noticed that i was still practicing with the discomfort with the pain there was a

320
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:58,400
tiny tiny subtle subtle oh i wanted not to be here i wanted to

321
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:04,880
go away when i saw that there was just this complete acceptance like no we can be

322
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,000
here it's fine then there was complete freedom that yeah the pain can really be

323
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,200
here and i can be free i can have ease i can be i can have there can be

324
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:22,160
well-being even if in the conventional sense there is no

325
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:29,119
well-being so so lots and lots of layers of practice

326
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:36,000
over time be patient be patient be patient and i'd love to hear if there

327
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,920

with sharing your practice thank you

336
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:44,720
murray christine please um for me was a little bit complicated i

337
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:51,920
found in terms of the um wanting to push away the aversion that there was room that i was bringing openness

338
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:57,200
yeah and but even though i was bringing up openness to it the actual the density

339
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:04,319
or the intensity of the pain actually heightened but it wasn't i wasn't feeling aversion i was just aware that

340
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:10,960
the pain had kind of increased and i wasn't quite sure if it's because i was focusing too hard on it or

341
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,960
yeah thank you yeah yeah thank you mary christine so so what i'm hearing is that

342
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:23,280
by bringing your attention by bringing a aversion more into the sphere of experience it

343
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,400
seemed like the the pain intensified pain itself intensified and you wonder

344
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:35,599
whether it's because you're focusing on it too much because it wasn't my version that was intensifying i was quite aware of

345
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:42,800
letting go yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah interesting right um it it may

346
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:50,160
be so it's beautiful that you're aware you're aware of the letting go which is beautiful so what i would invite you to

347
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:56,400
to explore a little bit is is is your attention your awareness is it

348
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:02,800
laser sharp bring attention to the to the quality of your attention

349
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,920
bring awareness to the quality of your awareness is your awareness laser sharp

350
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,839
like okay like really paying attention to this right here now like what or is

351
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:19,599
it more diffuse and and so

352
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:27,040
which could be more spacious and helpful great thank you very christian great yeah megan please

353
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:35,680
i have a question with like a little bit of a reflection but i was curious

354
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:40,720
if you have advice on um times when the thing feels like a

355
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:45,839
threat to personal safety sort over the safety of others um

356
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:51,119
i had this experience today that was like a bit frightening and sort of left me

357
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:58,559
feeling uneasy and i just used that since it was there um and i noticed

358
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:04,160
unlike physical pain or even like other emotional pain where that spaciousness

359
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:10,800
just kind of works and um i can see it i just felt this like

360
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:18,079
vulnerability the whole time and so i actually switched over to tonglen because i couldn't

361
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:24,400
do anything else and i didn't know if that was a version coming up kind of

362
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:30,839
but when i did do the tongue one it it felt like it was the only thing that would help it to move

363
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:36,400
um so yeah yeah thank you megan and i'm gonna

364
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:43,760
as you if you need to be con stay unmuted because that what you're describing actually something that felt

365
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,520
threatening and unsafe for you and others it's slightly of a different

366
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:56,480
uh category than i think um the the invitation for for what a you

367
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:02,400
know in this particular practice i think what you were exploring so it sounds appropriate to more have tongue length

368
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:09,440
for that in a way so um let me feel interest you know is is this

369
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,800
would this tool still be appropriate for that um

370
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:20,160
i'm not yeah i think tonglen would be there right because it's here it's

371
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:26,880
yeah i'm i'm appreciating your inner wisdom to have i've decided that yeah actually

372
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:33,280
tangling feels more approved for this particular thing that feels unsafe from me and others uh

373
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,880
to work with and it's not just aversion to something that is

374
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,960
unpleasant it feels of a different category megan so yeah and you're welcome to unmute

375
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:52,720
yourself if you if you uh yeah you can do that if you want to make another comment yeah

376
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:59,040
yeah i guess i kind of i i like that you brought up the possibility that it would be in a

377
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:04,480
different category because i think it might be um yeah i'll have to keep

378
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:10,319
exploring the the thing that happened with the tongue line was i felt like there was almost like some

379
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:17,040
agency yeah in terms of it's like that fierce compassion sort of

380
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:22,800
exactly energy that i felt like needed to be there and and here's the

381
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:28,079
thing here's another clue i'm having right now it seems like this thing that happened was regarding

382
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:33,200
and some being some person yeah so tonglen the practice of

383
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:38,880
compassion especially and first compassion have to do with people whereas what i was describing is

384
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,319
has to do with phenomena right like something right phenomenal like pain ringing the ear something

385
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:50,000
that's happening or something in your life which is like something happening but not a person whereas what you're

386
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,480
working with was something happening with a person who did something that made you and feel unsafe and unsafe or

387
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:02,559
other so definitely tonglen and other practices people related practices so

388
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,839
yeah that's more appropriate thank you yeah thanks megan it's great

389
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:13,920
