00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:07,639
all right so hello and welcome again warm welcome wherever you are in the

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:13,160
world to this Friday edition of happy

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,840
hour so for the practice

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:27,160
today um I'd like to offer a um a practice of

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,160
of working with gratitude today and I'll tell you what The Inspirations are

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,360
multiple Inspirations for for today's practice one is that I'm going to try to

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:47,719
keep a give a lot of space a lot of spaciousness and a lot of Silence because I've noticed that for our Friday

8
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:53,160
evening or Saturday for the case of mar Christine in Australia um it's been nice

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,559
to have more space more silence at the end of a week just not too many words so

10
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:06,880
that's one idea I'm going to be bringing have keeping in mind for our uh practice

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,840
together now for the Gratitude uh the inspiration for this

12
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,920
practice um comes from having had a conversation with a student this past

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,040
week who's been working with this practice of be grateful to everyone

14
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,400
which is one of the loang practices so I wanted to flesh that out a little bit

15
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:38,119
and and support us all in exploring this beautiful practice which is just a wonderful practice for for everyone so

16
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:44,920
so this is just a couple of words about this so one

17
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,920
consideration is um know with a practice of gratitude generally we tend to be

18
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:57,719
grateful for what is easy what is good people that are benefactors in our lives

19
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,119
wonderful people we don't often think as people who push our buttons and

20
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,280
challenging people uh to be grateful for them and of course this practice really

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,319
opens us up and shifts our perspective to that and I wanted to share something

22
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,400
this is a commentary this paragraph is by PMA children and and just to say this

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:28,319
these um practices these L Jang uh practices are from Tibetan loang SC um

24
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:35,280
slogans there many of them many some of them seem more specific in the for the framework of Tibetan

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,480
practice but many of them are more General so so this is number 13 so this

26
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,720
is the commentary from Pema so she says others will always show you exactly

27
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:54,440
where you are stuck they say or do something and you automatically get hooked into a familiar

28
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,920
way of reacting shutting down speeding up or

29
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:09,000
getting all worked up when you react in a habitual way with anger greed and so

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,360
forth it gives you a chance to see your patterns and work with them honestly and

31
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,080
compassionately without others provoking you you remain ignorant of your painful

32
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,760
habits and cannot train in transforming them into the path of awak

33
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:42,080
so this is one way to have a sense of gratitude for everyone especially for

34
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,080
people who push our buttons because they they support us to wake up to see our habitual patterns because it's not

35
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:56,360
really about them our impatience our anger our whatever habitual pattern

36
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,400
comes up it's really about us so thank you dear person I'm having a challenge

37
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,040
with you are serving as a miror helping me wake up helping me uh see these

38
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,079
patterns loud and clear thank you thank you for being in my life thank you

39
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:21,120
otherwise I would think I'm awakened and you know just done and here thank you

40
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,120
you're showing me yes there is work to do to to to to cultivate my heart in

41
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,039
goodness and expand it in compassion so really just a sense of appreciation and gratitude that they are in your life

42
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:42,520
that they're helping you develop um in this way as and um so

43
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:49,840
having said that I want to say one more thing before getting into our meditation and that

44
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,240
is in order for this practice especially if we do it as a medit so you can take

45
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:02,960
this practice into your daily life in the next week or over the weekend if you like if the opportunity

46
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,280
arises being grateful for everyone and uh now for the practice for the

47
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,440
meditation practice on the cushion now what I suggest in order not to make it

48
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,919
busy and also to cultivate this hard space not thinking

49
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:30,919
space but just a settle space to land into a space of spaciousness calm quiet

50
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:36,039
and let instead of going out and thinking about people and things to be

51
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:42,319
grateful for which can get really busy I'm going to suggest a different

52
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:48,800
mode so listen carefully the mode is you sit in you sit

53
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,080
back into your seat with your breath your

54
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:02,319
body and you allow as whatever comes up when whether it's people in this case or

55
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:09,039
whatever comes up for it to be met in this space in an open heartedness of

56
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:15,280
gratitude kindness can I be grateful for this so it's a different kind of

57
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,840
practice it's a receptive practice and the answer might be no I can be grateful

58
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,199
for this right now is this pain in my knee it's okay don't push it just let it

59
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,800
be let there be kindness but we super receptive kind of practice which tills

60
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,880
the soil supports Us in more active in

61
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,960
the more going out practice okay does that make sense not if yes okay great

62
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,680
I'm think seeing a few Nots great all right so let's start practicing together

63
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,720

00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,840
e

168
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,760
e e

169
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:27,839
the last few minutes of our practice together

170
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:33,919
what if the people who are visiting are those you've had some

171
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:38,960
entanglement with and you really feel grateful for

172
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,679
them don't know quite why what the reason

173
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:49,960
is what the lesson is how you grow through this interaction but just

174
00:34:49,960 --> 00:35:00,680
feeling grateful for them let yourself be one of the visitors e

175
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:45,880
you are included in everyone to be grateful for

176
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,960
everyone including this being who is

177
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,640
you

178
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,560
e e

179
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:28,680
may all beings everywhere be happy may all beings everywhere be free

180
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:36,980
[Music]

181
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,838
thank you all for your practice

182
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:07,200
so I changed the setting so you're welcome to share with everyone or with just me or

183
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:17,119
reflection so I'll say a few words and um I'll start by saying that I

184
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:23,680
had never done this practice in this way and let it in this way and it was eye

185
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:32,480
opening for me was so beautiful it was similar but slightly different flavor from um

186
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,480
meta loving kindness for people with whom with have we have a challenge with

187
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,920
whom we have a challenge it was similar to that for me what I experienced but

188
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,920
slightly different actually it brought up nuances the sense of feeling grateful

189
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,640
not just feeling well may you be safe and happy person I'm having challenges with but oh I'm grateful for you I'm

190
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:03,160
grateful for you you I'm grateful for you and and as I was doing it these the

191
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:10,560
things that I'm truly grateful for in with they they really lit up with these

192
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,760
beings with these different people things in our history in our past just

193
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,800
really there was a lot of gratitude for them even for the difficulty just really

194
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:27,880
led up this practice not so much as a daily practice which is how the loang

195
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:34,520
slogans are often practiced but as a formal practice I had never done a formal silent practice of feeling

196
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:42,160
gratitude for these visitors of the heart uh we have challenges with so for me it was just really beautiful I loved

197
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,480
it and I appreciate the practitioner who brought this into my Consciousness this

198
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,520
past week so thank you and thank you all for practicing this together so would

199
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:58,280
love to hear what what it was like for you what did you discover um you can

200
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,480
type in chat privately to me I won't read your name or to everyone I will

201
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:09,520
read your name or raise your Zoom hand which would be either under reactions or

202
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:15,240
or somewhere else you probably know it by now and uh I'm ask you to unmute so

203
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:22,119
Mari Christine please for me the challenge was that

204
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:28,760
every time I opened the door I got carried away with the dialogue I couldn't just open the door

205
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:34,880
and be with it I had to talk in my head of course so it was it was it was

206
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,280
interesting but it was a bit challenging that we not to get carried away with the dialogue yeah yeah thank you for sharing

207
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:46,480
that thank you so what what I would suggest to kind of help with that would

208
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,119
be um don't leave your seat don't go to the door don't go open the door because

209
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:57,440
we have the habit of when we open the door like hey how are you you know this kind of like it's in our body in our Bon

210
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:06,200
the habit of talking and whereas um if you um um just you are in your seat they

211
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:14,119
come they visit they just hang out at the door or and you're silent you're silent then it can it can support that

212
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:19,760
Mario Christine how does that sound yeah yeah thank you thank you so much that's

sitting in the couch whatever it was and I stay in there just welcoming all those

222
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:30,440
people coming to six doors and I was so surprised as there are so many people coming in

223
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:38,520
especially uh the person I actually arguing with in the morning it wasn't really arguing but who does uh business

with me who I hire to do something and uh

225
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,839
basically he was actually saying that you know what this is not gonna work

226
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:57,720
because you know he was talking about all those like um you w to you are my

227
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:03,559
managing stuff which is true you know I mean to be honest I don't feel offended

about anything at all someone tell me what's my personality I'm just okay

229
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,520

230
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:21,880
work and blah blah blah but he actually was saying it in a really nice um from

231
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:28,079
his heart I could see it because he's been he's been great for me you know he helped me through through and stuff like

232
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:34,839
that he's very honest and all that and he was like so stood up so much in that
