1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,439
so I think I have all the computers and screens and buttons

2
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:26,320
and audio set up for this and as I said I've been away and happy to be back and

3
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,840
be with you all and I've been teaching a two-week retreat for experienced

4
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:40,520
practitioners and uh it was really lovely to be so deeply connected for two weeks

5
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:47,719
with a group of people who are so dedicated to engaging in the

6
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:55,840
practice and um it was uh so I'm still kind of in the momentum of that retreat

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,000
it ended yesterday and uh I'm looking forward to

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,240
in the fall in September teaching a month-long retreat

9
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,040
uh for experienced practitioners and this has been a dream we've had for our

10
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,960
retreat center at Insights uh retreat center for since we we started in 2012

11
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:28,200
uh we almost had a month-long retreat in May of 2020 but then the lockdown

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,159
happened so now we're fine it looks like we're going to get to it and there was kind of a warm up for me to do the two

13
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:44,000
week this last time so welcome everyone to back to this 7

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,360
a.m youtube and uh they will do a followup

15
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,880
or a second part to what was started in beginning of January which was a series

16
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,920
on samadei and the partner to samadei is

17
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,040
insight vipasana and uh it's sometimes combined

18
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,520
with the um the word samata

19
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:20,400
vipasana and samata uh here means uh calm and vipasana means

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:28,400
clear seeing in Chinese when they ch translated Buddhist terms into Chinese

21
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,920
they use the characters stop for samata and for ordinary word to see for

22
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:43,800
vipasana stop and see so this long wonderful process of

23
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,160
stopping all our proliferations all our preoccupations all the ways we're

24
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:56,720
caught it's a a phenomenally wonderful process to be engaged in slowing down

25
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,879
the mind's preoccupations so that we can see

26
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:11,599
clearly and as we slow down calm down settle down

27
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,319
uh have some samadei it's remarkable what we can see that's not available if

28
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:26,159
we're not settled if we're not haven't stabilized the mind and in fact it's a long tradition

29
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:33,840
of understanding that without some degree of samadei it's inconceivable to understand

30
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,599
uh what's possible in terms of the degree of clarity the degree of

31
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,280
peace degree of well-being that's possible for a human

32
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:53,720
being and um so to have some degree of stability that allows us to see

33
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,080
clearly so to begin this meditation today and begin the series

34
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,959
on insight we begin with calling

35
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:14,000
upon whatever delights you inspires you about

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,040
sitting down to meditate right now maybe gently closing your

37
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:27,199
eyes maybe for some of you is simply to be here like me i'm

38
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:34,400
inspired to be here with you all for this 7 a.m meditation and maybe there's a kind of

39
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,680
happiness or gladness to have this opportunity

40
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:51,440
some of you have done this for a long time and so maybe there's the comfort of

41
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,199
familiarity maybe there's the confidence of engaging in something that you

42
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,080
believe in or value tremendously or somewhat

43
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,560
and to feel the inspiration the joy

44
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,400
of of simply being here to

45
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:23,000
meditate and feel it in such a way that the thinking

46
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,080
mind feels comforted or safe enough to quiet

47
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:37,479
quiet to better feel the sensations in the body heart

48
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:40,800
mind of

49
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:53,560
well-being and maybe for some of you there's also a kind of sense of

50
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,960
rightness of assuming your meditation posture

51
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,440
maybe there's inspiration with the posture to be back in a familiar

52
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,280
place maybe a joy that this body and its

53
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:19,319
posture is a bit like a temple a sacred

54
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,360
place that you have returned to

55
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,199
and in the middle of this familiar

56
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:43,479
and maybe happy place to gently take a few long deep

57
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:51,120
breaths not too deeply not too strongly just enough to say hello to your breathing

58
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:59,639
and for your breathing to say hello to you just enough for there to be a

59
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,639
reconnection refamiliarity

60
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,319
letting your breathing return to

61
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:42,080
normal and part of samadei is

62
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:51,800
stability and as you exhale ordinary exhale relax let go

63
00:07:51,800 --> 00:08:01,199
into how the weight of your body rests against some surface chair

64
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,120
cushion floor bed

65
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,240
stabilizing yourself by

66
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,599
grounding your weight on the surface

67
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,160
and is as if the mind itself has

68
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,640
weight as you exhale let that very

69
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,839
light weight of the mind maybe of awareness

70
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:06,360
itself settle and steady itself

71
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:21,600
almost as if the mind or at least awareness can settle into your

72
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:36,200
torso to accompany your breathing

73
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,160
relaxing the thinking

74
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:27,200
mind and letting awareness enter into the sensations of

75
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,640
the body breathing as if it's a coming

76
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,480
home as if it's coming

77
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,360
into a safe place a sacred

78
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:57,519
place a supportive place simply to be breathing in and

79
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,920
breathing out

80
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:31,679
as you breathe in calming your

81
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:41,640
body as you breathe out calming your body and mind

82
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:57,240
as you breathe recognizing any degree of

83
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:03,000
calm that might be present for you

84
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,320
as you exhale spread your

85
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,360
awareness into whatever diffuse

86
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,240
calm there is in your body

87
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,000
and

88
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:52,799
then with an inner eye an inner

89
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,760
clarity what do you see

90
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:09,120
what do you see or how do you

91
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:17,000
see that's easier while you're calm

92
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:40,720
and if you turn your calm eyes your inner

93
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:45,600
eyes towards the people of your

94
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:58,080
life and with calm eyes calm consideration

95
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:06,440
do you see them in a new way or in a good way

96
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,840
as we bring this meditation to a

97
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:43,320
close gaze upon the world kindly and

98
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:51,279
offer to the world your wish for a better world

99
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:58,760
your inspiration to contribute to a better world

100
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,600
may it be that with your ability to be

101
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,480
calm and to see

102
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,000
clearly that you

103
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:27,799
can promote happiness in this world promote safety in this world

104
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,360
promote peace in this

105
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:46,039
world bring greater freedom and liberation to this world

106
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,600
may all beings be happy

107
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,440
safe peaceful and free

108
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:13,709
[Music]

109
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,720
thank you

110
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,039
so good morning and welcome and

111
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:38,159
um returning here with the sun beginning to come in through the windows and

112
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,840
um I think in the past I've had a little umbrella or something there in the way

113
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:50,080
but tomorrow I'll see if I can not have it so bright on my face it's a little

114
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:58,480
bit much for me even but um I can't complain too much about

115
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,320
sitting in the light the light of samadei the light of

116
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:10,880
insight and um so welcome to this beginning of a

117
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:19,520
part two of part one was the I guess we had about 60 talks on samadei and I

118
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:28,840
don't think there'll be so many this time around but this part two is uh insight and these two are paired in

119
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:37,039
Buddhism samadei and vipasana uh vasana is a poly word pasana

120
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:44,320
means to see and v is an emphatic prefix so to see in a special way to see uh

121
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,799
it's often translated is clear seeing and

122
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:59,600
um and uh and the relationship between samadei and vipasa samadei and insight

123
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,640
is variable different teachers will make have different emphasis

124
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:11,799
and um one of the contributions uh in the 20th century of Burmese

125
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:16,960
Buddhism was uh to introduce people to a

126
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:24,559
way of doing inside practice without the need for a very intense level of samadei

127
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:31,919
intense level of concentration and um and uh so that

128
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,559
uh and so that was called um uh dry

129
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:45,159
vipasana because it wasn't uh supported by the strong degree of pleasure joy and

130
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:50,720
happiness that can pervade the body when there's samadei

131
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,720
however the way that it was taught to me in Burma the so-called dry samadei dry

132
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:04,000
vipasa uh came along with a lot of concentration anyway it wasn't to the

133
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,559
degree of the very intense way that the Burmese had expected samadei to be

134
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:17,840
about and um and uh and so I was uh uh blessed by being

135
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:27,279
able to do the insight work uh partnered with a degree of samadei which um is closer to seemingly

136
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,960
closer to how the Buddha taught vipasana he did not teach the most intense form

137
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:40,480
of samadei that a human being can can acquire but a a a lesser degree that

138
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:47,679
kept people connected um uh to their lived experience in their body but in in

139
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:54,159
a way that filled the body with a sense of well-being and part of the function and

140
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:00,399
so uh compared to the most dry form of insight where there's no samadei

141
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:06,320
whatsoever uh uh the um one way to to practice them

142
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:15,640
is a happy combination of the two where there is some samadei and uh and an

143
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:21,760
insight and the samadei creates a good foundation for insight because you

144
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,279
cannot have a lot of insight night unless the thinking mind has has uh

145
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:36,159
settled down um oddly enough one of the insights that we are resting in and is

146
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:43,039
to rest or flow in the changing river that constantly shifting changing

147
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:49,440
inconstant uh experience of sensations in the body uh and that's a phenomenal

148
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,679
way begins to loosen up uh attachments clinging we have and introduce us to a

149
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,240
whole different inner sensibility i call it sometimes the deep

150
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:09,720
mind and um and uh in order for that to happen the constantly shifting changing

151
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:17,360
inconstant fickle uh the nature of the thinking mind needs to quiet down and so

152
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:24,720
there's a kind of if the thinking mind becomes still and quiet and uh and uh

153
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,600
then we can start entering into this very deep the deep mind the deep sensations the deep sensitivity within

154
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:38,760
that opens up a whole different way of being in the world and so part of the function of samadei is to help quiet the

155
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:45,799
mind quiet the thinking mind still the mind but to do so in a way that's very

156
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:52,399
welcoming that uh of course the mind wants to be quiet when the rewards the

157
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:59,279
sense of well-being sense of coming home uh into samadei into a subtleness into

158
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:07,240
this deep place of sensitivity within it feels so good so right feels like

159
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:15,200
um um um you know this is the healthy place to be the thinking mind can't

160
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,638
believe this sometimes because thinking mind sometimes is filled with fear and

161
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:28,158
uh the thinking mind thinks that it has to think its way out of its fear or solve the problems it has uh thinking

162
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,440
mind maybe has resentments sense of betrayal and it's only by kind of

163
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,560
ruminating on them or trying to figure out how to somehow cope with them or

164
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,878
deal with them uh repeat them to ourselves that we can find a solution um

165
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,320
there's all kinds of ways happiness joy success in life the thinking mind kind

166
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:57,118
of is convinced that that's you know it's going to figure this out for ourselves

167
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,160
um and or maybe there's no sense of an inner life which is satisfying and

168
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,880
meaningful and and uh and filled with well-being and so the only avenue for

169
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,880
happiness success safety that uh someone knows is through the thinking mind

170
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,839
because they don't know an alternative so of course they're going to be enga g engaged in that and not

171
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:29,520
wanting to give it up samadei teaches us something very different it teaches us how there's a

172
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,800
profound sense of well-being uh that's below the thinking mind below the

173
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:43,000
surface mind and uh there's a profound profound sense of um of uh stillness and

174
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:51,560
quiet uh that is is a form of safety is a form of uh happiness is a form of

175
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:58,320
joy and as sama so that allows the mind to quiet down so that it can then this

176
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,720
that's the stopping or the stilling of the mind the calming of the mind of samadei

177
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:09,560
samata and then it shifts to being able to see more

178
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,960
clearly and uh and being see it's not just seeing more clearly but it's also

179
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:22,160
seeing something we don't normally see uh we don't normally see uh the deep

180
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:30,280
operating systems going on the deep the deep kind of uh um uh organizing

181
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:36,000
principles by which we organize our life the deep beliefs the deep attitudes the

182
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,560
deep emotions that uh either support our life or undermine our life they're re

183
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:49,880
usually generally inaccessible by a mind that's preoccupied in thoughts ruminating thinking a lot fantasizing a

184
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,520
lot and so there's a whole different way of engaging ourselves that I believe is

185
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:02,440
very respectful because it it's a deeper more fully engaged part of who we

186
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:11,680
are and uh the combination of samadei and insight is that samadei done well is

187
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,880
that um uh uh is a way of becoming fully

188
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:24,000
embodied and fully embodied doesn't mean that now we're a hedenist feeling a lot

189
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,880
of joy in the body uh uh uh it allows for the insight to be

190
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,079
integrated into the full range of our psychological life our emotional life

191
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:42,040
our lived life that sometimes is not possible if we don't have a degree of

192
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:50,240
samadei if samadei is helping us calm and expand ha uh into the whole body

193
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,599
then we're touching all the different places that the body is um connected to

194
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,800
our psychology our emotions the places of tension and holding and the places of

195
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:08,880
deep sense of well-being and joy and so the function one of the functions of samadei is to help us have the clarity

196
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:15,920
to have insight but also helps the insight we have to be deeply integrated

197
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:25,359
into our whole psychological makeup and uh and so going into uh

198
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:31,200
having insight be able to include all of who we are makes it means we don't have

199
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:37,200
a bypass spiritual bypass means that we it's really beneficial in our whole life

200
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:43,119
and as we have deeper kind of deeper and deeper kind of sense of peace and insight the it's good to have the

201
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:49,920
insight itself be integrated into our full spectrum of our life so the

202
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,680
integration the combination of samadei and insight is a wonderful happy uh

203
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:03,760
partnership and um and so the the the first part of this year when

204
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:10,400
we did samadei hopefully uh for those of you who did it will set the stage or not

205
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:17,920
the stage but set your body in place for uh ability to have insight and insight

206
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,200
in um in a way that's deeply integrated into yourself

207
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:29,040
for those of you who might be joining now for the first time um uh maybe some

208
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,880
of the benefits of samadei won't be so easily accessible to you but still uh

209
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,480
there'll be that the as we go through this and integrate these two uh you'll

210
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,800
probably benefit uh getting a sense of what's going on here and it might open

211
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:53,040
up a new orientation for you in meditation that even for a beginner

212
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,440
might be um beneficial so um so this is a very general

213
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,280
introduction to what we'll be doing and uh some of what I just just

214
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:11,599
said we'll we'll we'll kind of repeat or go into more deeply uh this week and uh

215
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:20,400
and more and um I'm very happy to be able to um introduce or begin this this

216
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,200
journey in insight it's been a phenomenally

217
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:36,400
um wonderful process in my life journey in my life to be on the insight journey

218
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:44,838
and now to share it with you will be uh it's my pleasure so thank you very much
