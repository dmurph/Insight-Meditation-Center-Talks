1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:08,340
so my my topic for today is spiritual friendship and I have to say I am

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,639
brimming overflowing with uh emotion as I kind of

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,160
contemplate joy and just move my heart is so moved and just now like just this

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,880
these offerings that have just been announced and are being offered are by you know this is the Sangha this is

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,740
spiritual friendship this is amazing you know um

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,420
I think uh I hope you all know how welcome you are here

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,700
that you you know that each of you belong here if you want to be here

8
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:53,640
that you get to be fully who you are and be here and uh Gil I'd love Gill uh as a teacher

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,280
and one of his teachings is um you know you're a member of IMC if

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,100
you want to be if you don't like membership no problem you can still come like whatever it is

11
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,740
that works for you that's how spacious it is and I guess I'll um

12
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,960
can you zoom in in on this for the YouTube folks I'll pass this around but

13
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,320
maybe you've noticed this so when you come in the door there's a very a transparent logo on the front door and

14
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:30,600
this is also posted by the door it's still in draft form but um it says all are welcome here

15
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,960
all are welcome here and there was a group of us that worked on you know collaborating to create this

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:45,180
sign and um wow was it wow was it a project I to think about how do you represent

17
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,600
everyone being welcomed and I'm not suggesting we did it but you

18
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,939
know really not but it was the best that we could do so it was good enough for

19
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:03,840
now and I love it it's beautiful okay I'm gonna move my arm now and just kind

20
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,959
of um you know just to talk about what this includes is um you know three hands

21
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:17,099
right three hands of different races colors ethnicities together holding

22
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:24,540
a young tree a Bodhi Tree which is what the Buddha is said to have enlightened under you know that it takes us all

23
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:32,340
coming together and that it's it's our heartfulness it's our kindfulness it's our mindfulness that create the soil and

24
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:39,959
conditions for all of us to thrive all of us to thrive and then of course we have a rainbow here for

25
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:46,099
you know the lesbian gay bisexual transgender

26
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:52,580
asexual non-conforming gender non-binary everything

27
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,840
two-spirited plus people in our world and when we were

28
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,920
working on this we like tried to list all the kinds of identities that we could think of how can we represent this

29
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,400
and we tried you should have seen the other models they were a little too much

30
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,720
this this this kind of was like I said the best that we could do

31
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,120
so I'll just pass it around and um you can look at it or not just you know

32
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,459
allow it to flow I just want you all the opportunity to see it

33
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:33,360
huh and um so it was you know as I was kind of

34
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,799
growing nurturing like you know yeast inside of me this talk and my

35
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,260
Reflections on spiritual friendship I was thinking about a name for it a

36
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,319
title for it and um first I thought well mindfulness is spiritual friendship I thought about

37
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,360
um heartfulness this spiritual friendship and then I remembered

38
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,720
um ajan Brahm wrote a book called kindfulness

39
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:09,120
and that just it's like oh yeah yeah so mindfulness and heartfulness and there's

40
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,819
this term in Pali chitta which represents heart and mind together

41
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:21,900
heart and mind together because friendship really especially spiritual friendship does require the

42
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:28,919
heart and mind to come together because to be kind we have to be we have

43
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:36,540
to engage the mental capacity to assess a situation to implore and and work from

44
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:43,500
Wise view wise intention and have wise action we need them bind to be engaged

45
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,320
and that without equality of the heart this the kind sort of the quality of

46
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:57,418
this you know the Brahma baharas loving kindness compassion Joy

47
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,540
and Equanimity balance we we absolutely need all of these things and so this

48
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,759
term kindfulness for me really was where I

49
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,300
I settled kindfulness is spiritual practice

50
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:21,419
kindfulness and the you know

51
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:27,560
spiritual friendship is what this Sangha is made from

52
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:34,099
completely what the song is made from it's amazing actually

53
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,560
so everything here started in a

54
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,960
I think it was at the um what's it called

55
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:53,100
Hillary what was the name of the the friend yeah what was it but it was called the

56
00:05:53,100 --> 00:06:01,500
friend what do you remember what it was called there was like a um a small Center that let us

57
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:09,780
um calm and practice like I wasn't even part of the song it was like maybe six or nine people or 10 or 12 or whatever

58
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:16,020
and then they brought Gillen to be a teacher and they just rented spaces until this

59
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:22,020
Sangha grew and they raised money to buy this building

60
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:28,919
this building was a church and that's probably how we got it because the church you know owners and

61
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:34,860
Gill met and they appreciated what we were going to be doing here sitting in silence

62
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:41,400
right so everything here is because of Donna generosity

63
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:50,039
and people coming together and working together and the image I have for Sangha in this this place is like a spider web

64
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:58,199
there are so many people doing little bits to keep and create the

65
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:05,639
space unbelievable number of people and so who here Volunteers in some way just

66
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:12,660
raise your hand we got one two three four five six seven

67
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:19,800
like eight nine ten I don't know this is like you know quarter of us sitting here

68
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,319
at least and right now there's 150 people in person and online sitting

69
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:31,319
gills three-week Retreat which means a lot of people who would normally be here who are volunteers are not here

70
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:37,020
so probably half of us would be normally volunteers Hillary does that sound about right

71
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:45,060
as our amazing volunteer coordinator Hillary and so the the spiderweb image for me is

72
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:52,380
so powerful because it's like every every little intersection of the web is people

73
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:58,819
holding hands taking one piece from the next person like getting a flyer printed

74
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:04,259
takes a person to teach a per you know and that person usually creates a draft

75
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:12,479
and then somebody else prints it and you know like there's just everything here is hand to hand and that I was thinking

76
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:19,080
organizational charts and you know how they're looking fairly linear you know they have like little

77
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,900
veins that come off and there's this stacking we're we're a spider web our

78
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:32,039
organizational chart is an absolute spider web and there's often things that you know

79
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,560
people leave and come and go so just like a spider web is imperfect we are imperfect

80
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:45,060
we are absolutely imperfect and there are places where Things Fall Apart and don't go well and

81
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:52,320
and and then there's people that come in and connect this strand with a headstrand like this you know or their

82
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,160
toes with their feet too you know it's amazing and and then another thing about this

83
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:07,860
spiderweb is that it's loving kindness it's the it's the kindness and the compassion and the joy and the

84
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,740
Equanimity that the practitioners these people holding hands creating this

85
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:20,820
space that is you know tenuous and strong but bringing that heart quality lights

86
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:29,040
up the web like golden strands absolutely the heart quality just moves

87
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:36,620
through the whole thing and makes it absolutely beautiful absolutely beautiful

88
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:49,440
so thank you for being here because also just being here even if you're not a volunteer

89
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,600
you're supporting my practice because if I didn't have somebody to

90
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,899
that I was inspired to share this with all of this goodness that's been coming

91
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:07,620
up for me would not be here it would not be arising in the same kind of way

92
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:15,720
it's your practice your attending you're coming that supports my practice deeply

93
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,439
deeply

94
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,420
so I'll give you a little bit of a there's no I have no idea how much I'll

95
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:35,880
get to but these are the things that I have in mind I like to let you know where I want to go before I go there

96
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,220
so number one how powerful spiritual friendship is for our practice how

97
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:48,620
supportive it is it's incredibly supportive I've been talking about that already I'll say a little bit more

98
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:55,380
of uh asuta called good you know good-hearted friends advice for laypeople that comes from the teaching

99
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:01,440
of the Buddha to share that highlight the importance of

100
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:09,500
understanding that spiritual friendship is actually a training it is something we train in

101
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:16,980
it's not haphazard and and then there's this important part

102
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:25,079
of suffering that is part of spiritual friendship and which is you know in all of us we're

103
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:30,899
conditioned right this is what the Dharma in a Buddha taught us we get conditioned by life

104
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:36,660
automatic pilate takes over and we're no longer present

105
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:42,540
well this is really true in relationships as you know right

106
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:49,440
as you know so understanding that deeply is incredibly important to to knowing

107
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,620
and being able to be a spiritual friend and then

108
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:02,640
um maybe I'll say this now but another part of my inspiration for this topic tonight

109
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:09,540
is that starting in October on Thursday nights I'll start a two-month series on mindful

110
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:17,279
mindful speaking and mindful listening it's incredibly incredibly important

111
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,560
part of our life and being spiritual friends to each other

112
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,100
and I have a practice some of you may be aware of the raft practice

113
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,800
anybody know about raft not many couple so I'll talk a little

114
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:42,079
bit about how to use a raft in the context of relationship spiritual friendship

115
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,839
so I have a I have a poem to read to you

116
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,240
and um maybe before I read it um

117
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll just ask you to think about bring to mind a spiritual friend somebody

118
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,480

and anyone who is willing to speak if you share out loud any of those

accepting and caring good listener

138
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:34,260
really important I was listening to a talk

139
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:40,139
um by James baraz on spiritual friendship and he so this is like third hand right and he was talking about

140
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:46,139
somebody who teaches non-violent communication a lot and that he said that that person said

141
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:53,240
that when it comes to non-violent communication it was the listening that mattered the most

142
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:06,120
so I'm there's more right it's okay this was good and so here's this poem

143
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,760
and the title of the poem is aftermath

144
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:19,199
I'll say more at the end of the poem those seeds you planted in me with your

145

when they take hold it bloom bloom in US wow what an aftermath

152
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,040
this is by Rosemary traumer

153
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:24,620
so what did the Buddha say about spiritual friendship he actually said you know some pretty and poignant things

154
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,660
and um one suta he says with regard to external

155
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:39,120
factors so things of the environment outside of ourselves I don't Envision any other single Factor

156
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,360
like admirable friendship is doing so much for a monk in training

157
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,880
no other not any other Factor like admirable

158
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,019
friendship can do so much for a monk in training

159
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,940
that's that's pretty significant

160
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,860
I'm sure you've heard the this I I chose not to bring this suta into because so

161
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:14,039
well referenced but you know there's this conversation between Ananda do you know who Ananda is the cousin and the

162
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:19,440
attendant to the Buddha and and there's this conversation where

163
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,860
the Buddha and Ananda are sitting together and Ananda is probably you know feeling really uplifted by spiritual

164
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:33,360
friendship and they're sitting there and he's talking and Ananda says Noble one oh Lord you know friendship is

165
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:40,380
half of the spiritual path and the Buddha responds by saying no Ananda don't say that it's all of the

166
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:47,280
past it's very very pivotal really really

167
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:54,840
really really powerful there's um a poly word for Spiritual

168
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,039
friendship and it's kalyana Mita I like this word km for short

169
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:09,299
kalyanamita you're my kalyanamita my km kaliana can be translated as spiritual

170
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:16,380
can also be translated as good true virtuous upright or beneficial

171
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:22,679
and Mita is the same root as meta

172
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:28,860
loving kindness loving kindness

173
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:35,000
good friend spiritual friend virtuous friend

174
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:44,100
and another suta Nakaya 31 the Buddha gave a teaching

175
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,740
about good-hearted friends and it's advice for Lay people that's us right

176
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,960
or lay people and he's talking to um

177
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,059
a young man and he said be aware of these four good-hearted friends

178
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:06,000
and describes describes them as a helper one who endures one who's a mentor and

179
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,559
one who's compassionate so I'm going to talk a little bit about each of these four qualities

180
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:21,140
and the Buddha said the helpful friend can be seen to be loyal a loyal friend in four ways

181
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:27,600
he looks after you when you're inattentive right looks after you when you're

182
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:36,600
inattentive he looks after you when your possessions are inattentive you're unattended

183
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,760
he is a refuge when you are afraid

184
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:48,539
that's profano just hit me you know a refuge when you're afraid right how you

185
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:56,600
know it's not everybody who can hold us with their presence or listen when we're afraid not everybody can do

186
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,960
it's a really big thing to be stable enough to be with somebody when they're afraid

187
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,799
to see them with their potentials still intact right

188
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:17,940
and um and then the last thing he says is when some business is to be done

189
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:25,320
he lets you have twice what you ask for twice so this generosity right

190
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,100
in our city

191
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,000
there's um this is an example from tiknot Hans

192
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,299
Sangha of this idea of being helpful and twice

193
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:54,740
what one is asking for they created something called second body Sangha second body Sangha

194
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:02,640
we established a second body practice to deepen our relationships and to support our practice

195
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,940
each participant has two bodies a Sangha member they care for and their

196
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:15,659
own body the care was determined by Mutual consent and might entail a weekly phone

197
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:19,340
call or a daily sitting practice

198
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:27,240
pretty cool I read you know there's an article and I think it's lion's roar somebody wrote about it who was there

199
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:33,419
and described you know waking up or being sick and you know having food show

200
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:38,419
up for him because his second body brought him food and

201
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:46,799
I I just really appreciated this idea this notion the way it was framed right

202
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,679
the second body just your second body like somebody who's there just to do these things and

203
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:58,860
there's something about that too that's like you know you you don't get any gold star

204
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:04,380
for being a good friend the second body you're just acting like you would for

205
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,780
your own body right you you have this care for another

206
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:15,799
like you care for yourself it's just beautiful

207
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:24,240
the second quality um is described as an enduring friend

208
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,460
the friend who is the same and happy and unhappy times

209
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:36,059
can be seen as a loyal friend in four ways he tells you his secrets she guards her

210
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:41,580
secrets they do not let you down in misfortune

211
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,039
they would even sacrifice their life for you

212
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,740
so what is this what does enduring through good and bad times

213
00:23:52,740 --> 00:24:00,120
friendship look like what does that mean you know here at IMC it might be you know somebody

214
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:06,320
hasn't been coming for a long time and we welcome the back no matter what right

215
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:16,500
I might mean you know being willing to listen to Somebody's fears or difficulties or Joys over and over again

216
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,419
or in really great detail

217
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,919
the third quality is the friend who points out what is good for you

218
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:38,580
it's also described as a mentoring friendship the friend who points out what is good

219
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:45,240
for you can be seen to be a loyal friend in four ways they keep you from wrongdoing

220
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:51,360
they support you in doing good inform you of what you did not know and

221
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,700
they point out the path to Freedom

222
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:05,899
in our in our scene here we have kind of formal and informal mentors

223
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,919
formal Mentor might be a teacher right somebody who's in a role as a teacher

224
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:20,520
an informal Mentor might be the way somebody is sitting

225
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:27,539
during meditation that inspires you the way somebody

226
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:32,700
behaves and demonstrates through these qualities of love and kindness and you

227
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:37,519
know compassion and sympathetic Joy

228
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:48,059
and you know even um Gill likes to prefer he prefers being

229
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:53,000
thought of as a spiritual friend over a teacher

230
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,539
there's something really you know connected about that isn't there

231
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:14,600
really connected it's the word that comes to mind for me

232
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:30,299
I think I'll say here too just that you know this is certainly how he came to be my

233
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:36,480
teacher was I started you know volunteering

234
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,539
I showed up I supported him he supported me in all kinds of ways

235
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:49,380
like he did a lovely job with a bell I remember the first time I managed an event and I hit the bell at the end of

236
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:55,679
the sit everybody jumped out of their seats it was so loud oh my God and you

237
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,440
know he was so kind to me after this he was just so kind like

238
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,659
he taught me brought me over helped me learn how to hit the bell and just said

239
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:13,880
there's no mistakes here there's no mistakes here wow

240
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:28,740
techn says what is most important is to find peace and to share it with others

241
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:36,600
right this is a spiritual friend this is what Gil did for me he has found peace and he

242
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,899
shared it with me in that moment and many others

243
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:50,100
so spiritual friendship is a training it is actually something it is like

244
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:58,140
practice it is it is practice it is the embodiment of our practice it's bringing our practice not just from

245
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,778
this inner realm but to everything that we do

246
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:10,679
and you know um incredibly important part of our our

247
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:16,580
training in the Eightfold Path right which is said to be the way to Freedom

248
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:23,220
in the middle of that is Sila or ethical or virtuous action

249
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:30,679
and it includes wise action wise speech wise livelihood

250
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,779
and wise action is the abstaining of killing living beings

251
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:42,179
right abstaining from taking what is not given

252
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:47,340
abstaining from false speech abstaining from [Music]

253
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,559
um harmful sexuality

254
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:59,460
and abstaining from intoxicants that cloud the mind and cause heedlessness

255
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:07,980
so by engaging in these five wise actions we you know we're we're abandoning a lot

256
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:16,399
of greed and a lot of hatred and hopefully a lot of delusion too

257
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:23,460
so this is a really important part of of how we train these are things that we don't just do

258
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:31,500
you know when we're casually there are things that we do thoughtfully mindfully

259
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,240
there are these four Brahma viharas which are um kind of essentially

260
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,898
expressions of love spiritual love

261
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:58,140
and um they're really healthy emotional mental States

262
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,539
that really support us and

263
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:10,200
they arise without craving aversion and ego

264
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,919
if we have too much craving aversion and ego They Don't Really rise up

265
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:22,320
and their helpful emotions that are much more likely to arise when

266
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,980
we're not preoccupied and when we're not kind of caught and

267
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:36,240
craving an aversion so this is core to our practice right

268
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:44,760
it's kind of like we can notice if we're in a Crowd Oh is there is there kind kindness present is there am I able am I

269
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,580
happy or envious with somebody else's Joy right if we're envious we've got craving

270
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:56,940
or aversion happening so it's a you know this beautiful mirror for us to find ourselves to find the

271
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:04,080
qualities that are active in our heart and mind at any one time how we respond to each other

272
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:10,740
is a a reflection for us of what's happening within ourselves

273
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,799
it helps us find and notice and recognize

274
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:25,140
and um you know the way Gill put this this is his

275
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:31,500
sentence contrary to the popular idea of Falling in Love is a mysterious process out of our

276
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,440
control the Buddha emphasized cultivating our capacity for love cultivating our capacity so it's not

277
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,539
something that just you know is this biochemical Rush

278
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:47,240
it's something that we we grow we train

279
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:55,320
and it's these kinds of Love is different than sensual desire it's different than affection that's

280
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,679
entangled with attachment and the need for reciprocity

281
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:08,880
so sometimes you know when we hear the teachings of Letting Go and not clinging

282
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:15,240
people feel like well but I'm attached to my family and my partner and

283
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,179
does that mean I'm not supposed to be no no no no what we need to abandon is the craving

284
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:26,840
not the love the clinging not the love

285
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:33,960
it's the whole grabbing onto the expectations the wanting something back wanting somebody to be different

286
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:41,340
you know wanting to control what people do the hat is what we need to let go of not the love

287
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:48,419
not the love so with loving kindness

288
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:54,779
um it's uh this wish for everyone to be happy and that's Happy in their own way

289
00:32:54,779 --> 00:33:00,779
not my way it's respect

290
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:06,779
showing respect right to the dignity and uniqueness of each person

291
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:13,440
and you know to Freedom I like to say

292
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,320
um let you be you and me be me right creating the conditions for us each to

293
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,899
flower fully the way we are for who we are into what we what we like our heart

294
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:28,580
most wants us to become

295
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:40,620
Christina Feldman wrote in the cultivation of metha friendship is turned into a verb

296
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:47,159
learning what it is to actively intentionally and consciously befriend all people including ourselves all

297
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:50,480
events and all experience

298
00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:00,720
the second Brahm of ahara which you know this first one loving kindness is really foundational it helps us kind of get

299
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,140
things going so it's really the starting place for most of us with the Brahma baharas

300
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:13,460
and from it we start to grow you know the capacity to have compassion

301
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:19,260
which I love the Aya kemma's teaching which is you suffer

302
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:24,358
just like me and just like me you know just like you I suffer so it's

303
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:29,760
yeah you you suffer too just like me and I suffered just like you you know

304
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:37,560
there's like we all suffer right so having the capacity to attune to

305
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:42,500
suffering and see it as this thing that we all share in common

306
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,419
and to have compassion for that and and then the wish to be a support for the

307
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,560
end of that suffering

308
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:02,160
and how we help or don't help with the suffering is really important to attend to and this

309
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,320
is where we come back to this idea of kindfulness bringing in the mind

310
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:14,640
there's this um a book I was trying to think of the name of it um happiness hypothesis Maybe

311
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,800
and there's a metaphor in the book about an elephant and a writer anybody know

312
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,640
this book no yeah is it happiness hypothesis is that the

313
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:34,440
name of it yeah Jonathan hade and um so he talks about the elephant as

314
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,800
you know like our body is the biggest part of us and and the biggest part of

315
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,859
us is also so much is unconscious or semi-conscious

316
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:52,820
you know this is the beauty of how our mind is is evolved and it's also

317
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:59,760
potentially the liability of how our mind has evolved because it's like um

318
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,900
there's so much that we need just to uh you know operate on an automatic level for functioning in this world

319
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:12,599
there's just way too many things that if we had to pay attention to them in detail that there's no way we'd have

320
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:20,160
awareness left for anything else it's like and when I was in high school I volunteered in the special needs

321
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:27,780
classroom and the assignment for me was to sit down and write how many steps it takes to tie a shoe I was shocked it was

322
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:34,560
I think it was 30 something I was absolutely shocked I was floored and so if you think about like that's

323
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,599
just one teeny tiny task and there's so many of these things and

324
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:45,660
this is where there's this Brilliance of this elephant that just knows how to learn how to do these things right and

325
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:50,820
can do them so that we can be a writer we can stay aware

326
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:58,200
but we also have to grow our awareness we have to kind of keep growing it especially as Things become more and

327
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,599
more routine familiar to us because we go to

328
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,640
sleep as the writer we go to sleep if we don't work on staying present and that's

329
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:15,000
mindfulness staying awake and aware and all the things in our life

330
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,599
all the things in our life that happened to us you know we get born into a body

331
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:28,140
into a family into a community culture Society

332
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:33,540
and we are our conditioning starts before we're born

333
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:38,760
the tone of our parents voices whether or not we're kept or adopted you know

334
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:45,300
who ends up being there to raise us how we're treated by the people around us what our third grade teacher tells us

335
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,640
about our drawings all of these things go deeply stored

336
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,280
into this elephant and they inform how we experience and like we I like to

337
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:02,280
think about amygdala this is sort of like the storehouse of memory and there's

338
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,220
something I like to think about as like the librarian and so something is happening and the

339
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:15,119
librarian without her telling us without her telling us to do it goes and searches all the memories it says what's

340
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:21,300
like this oh this is like this and this is like this and it just it chooses and it says okay here you go this is what's

341
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:27,420
happening right and and so we just we're our our present moment is informed by

342
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:35,000
our pasts and most of that was not anything you chose to put in there

343
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:41,880
a lot of it you probably really wish wasn't there and a lot of it you don't even know is

344
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:48,240
there it's like the water you're swimming in Gil talked last week about the training

345
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,940
in deep diversity that we did as a um you know Sangha

346
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:59,760
there's a book called um deep diversity written by Shakil Chaudhary

347
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:07,440
and he's a mindfulness practitioner and he wrote about bias and racism and um

348
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,040
oppression and you know how can we bring our practice to this world and get free

349
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:20,640
from for me how do I get free from what I have internalized and didn't want around my gender about my sexual

350
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:28,200
identity about my race as a white person how do I get free from that conditioning that I have how do I

351
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:35,099
free you from the conditioning I have about your gender your identity your race whoever you are how do I free you

352
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:42,780
and how do I free myself this is incredibly important work

353
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:48,540
and in the Sangha these these conditions these this bias these experiences that

354
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:54,780
we have they're gonna all bubble up they're going to all Bubble Up in various ways

355
00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:00,480
so it's incredibly important to be humble and to be listening and to be noticing

356
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,880
and remembering that when things come up for you and you're looking out at somebody else

357
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,760
and you're thinking it that comes from your story

358
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:18,900
that comes from your story and you know as a white person there's so

359
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:24,720
much conditioning around like thinking my my experience is the norm like like

360
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,020
that's how it is and so it's really easy to look out into the

361
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:36,180
world and see others as different I have a practice of when I see that happening

362
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:43,680
wait wait wait look at me how am I different I'm Different what's happening for me

363
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,960
what's my reference point here not about you me what's me what's going

364
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,599
on in here that's me to help me let go a little bit of that so I can more clearly

365
00:40:54,599 --> 00:41:00,300
see you and tiknot Han has this phrase when he's talking about being a

366
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:05,339
spiritual friend and and meeting someone with compassion he says

367
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:11,280
it's important to ask if we understand the other person not to assume we do

368
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,980
he says sweetheart do I know you well enough do I and you're asking do I know you

369
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:24,540
well enough to assume that I can respond to you in a way that's truly compassionate because if I'm responding

370
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:32,300
to you from my story my conditioning my past my bias I might just do more harm

371
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,500
so compassion is tricky because we have this elephant the heart gets moved and

372
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,780
the Heart elephant wants to rescue and take care of people and it's so powerful

373
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:51,900
unless the writer is really present really awake and aware the elephant can

374
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:58,740
like the bull in the china shop right can really trample over

375
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:06,000
people and that emotional conditioning there's um emotions I feel like are like a

376
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,420
derived system they're motivating action if you think about it you know if you

377
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:17,700
look at if you've seen those little Emojis with faces right we use them on

378
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:24,780
our phones and charts just the facial expression tells you so much about you

379
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:30,000
know what what somebody is feeling right and you can imagine what is the posture

380
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,300
of somebody who said right there's this whole

381
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:42,180
intense biophysiological thing that comes with a Feeling

382
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:48,060
so there's a there's this you know we're not even aware sometimes how far we're feeling and we're expressing it whether

383
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:53,400
it's anger sadness Joy so this is the elephant energy this

384
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:59,460
automatic natural beautiful intelligence in the in the system that gets polluted over time

385
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:06,300
you know but um it needs to be managed we need to be aware so that it doesn't just drive our

386
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:12,119
behaviors so another the third Brahma Bahar is

387
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:18,060
mutita which is you know sympathetic Joy or joy

388
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:25,560
it's like shared Joy it's like when somebody tells you

389
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:33,119
something like yesterday I had a friend texting me and said I'm really great today and I felt so happy I really was

390
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:39,380
like Yay that's so great right that's so great

391
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:48,480
and I think you know Joy there's a lot like if you follow Neuroscience if you

392
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:54,480
listen to Rick Hansen or a lot of other people that are teaching about happiness

393
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,720
right now and making our brains feel better you know we have this tendency to not

394
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,420
appreciate and settle and receive the joy that comes up in our life even for ourselves

395
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:12,960
the small little joys like this morning I took a picture of this guy of a friend

396
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,300
who we send photos each morning if we get outside for early morning light

397
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:24,720
because it's supposed to be very helpful for sleep right to get exposure to the early morning sunlight

398
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:30,720
within half an hour of waking up so it said I believe it but so we'll

399
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:36,000
take pictures when we go out when we actually make it so this morning I took this picture of the sky

400
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,880
and it was like confetti like clouds she said she when she first looked at it

401
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:48,359
looked like stars in the skies you know it was just this beautiful moment just taking this picture taking doing this

402
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:55,560
practice going out taking this picture sending it was like wow this is this helps me connect with the joy

403
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:02,720
take it in don't miss it right and this when we don't miss the joy the little joys in our our life

404
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:09,420
there's a lot more ease and ability to connect with the joy of others

405
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:15,540
when we're really disconnected from the joy in our life we're gonna miss the joy in others we're going to feel envious

406
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:23,339
resentful hurt left out so it's really a practice really

407
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:29,460
important practice for us to take it seriously to sip to take sips of the goodness

408
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:35,339
so take it all in yeah

409
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:40,500
what time are we ending what time are we supposed to end at what time

410
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:45,140
10 45 three minutes ago okay

411
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:52,079
yeah well I have more to say but hopefully I'll see you again and like I

412
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:59,700
said I'll be starting the mindful mindful listening and speaking and Thursday nights at 6 30 to 9 6 30 to 8

413
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:07,079
sorry here in person only and um I just you know thank you thank you for

414
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:12,240
