1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,759
so good morning good day just a quick reminder that we'll have a

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:16,519
community meeting after this session today and i'll say a little bit more about that later

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,680
but for now let's go ahead and meditate together so finding

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,640
your comfortable spot for meditation

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,399
and if you're comfortable doing so closing your eyes

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,879
bringing the attention inward to the sense of the body sitting

7
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,280
or maybe you're lying down or standing

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,920
not just sensing your meditation posture

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,240
and feeling into the balance and groundedness

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,119
and support of where you're sitting so actually sensing the

11
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:24,920
contact point with your seed against the cushion or the chair

12
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,119
and letting yourself be supported by that

13
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,759
and sometimes it's helpful to even explicitly check into the balance of where you're

14
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,320
sitting so you can even rock side to side slightly or forward and back to

15
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,520
just really find a middle point where the body feels the most

16
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,879
balanced i find that looking at a computer screen

17
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,080
sometimes i get a little bit pushed forward

18
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,160
so you might check if just settling back a little bit feels more

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,840
aligned and upright

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,959
if we're going to be sitting for a while that makes a difference

21
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,879
just to use as few muscles as possible

22
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,840
and then softening into that upright posture

23
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,840
softening the face the head

24
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,640
letting the head float on the spine

25
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,040
softening the shoulders

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,120
softening through the chest area [Music]

27
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,840
around the heart

28
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,360
and letting the belly be very soft and round

29
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,319
and letting go of any bracing in the arms or legs

30
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,000
so we're inviting a very useful bodily position

31
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,840
and then also the mindfulness in the mind

32
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:40,440
in a simple easeful way just to know how it is right now

33
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:09,440
sensing the sensations of the breathing which become more evident as the

34
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,800
body and mind settle a bit

35
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:39,840
and the invitation is to continue with the breath as an anchor

36
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,560
but allowing the mind to open to or turn toward

37
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,758
any object that becomes more compelling than the breath

38
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,199
so if a body sensation becomes strong or a sound

39
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,440
there doesn't need to be any conflict between that and wanting to stay with the breath just open to

40
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,919
what feels more compelling and then when that reduces in intensity

41
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,520
just naturally going back to the breath

42
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:38,479
and the same is true if there's a strong emotion or thought train that

43
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:45,360
comes up maybe at first we even get pulled into

44
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,080
it but then when we realize that's what it was just allowing that to be the object of

45
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,080
mindfulness until it's again not as compelling and

46
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,720
it's easy to return to the sensations of the breath

47
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:33,360
and to support this we could deliberately invoke

48
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,599
a sense of care care for your own heart

49
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,840
care for your mind states

50
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,720
it doesn't mean that we're going to block anything out and decide we're not going to have that mind

51
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,000
state it's still okay for anything to rise in

52
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,919
awareness but the care is in intending to meet it

53
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,240
well to meet it clearly with mindfulness

54
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,840
that itself is an act of care

55
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,080
and this quality of mindfulness that we've been exploring

56
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,519
for a while now is inherently balancing

57
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,000
that's actually one of its qualities

58
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,720
so if the mind is feeling sleepy or dull

59
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,200
it's mindfulness that knows that and often

60
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:35,320
just seeing that we're dull brings in a bit more energy

61
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,519
and when the mind is irritated [Music]

62
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:52,800
it's mindfulness that knows that and that can feel the pain of that

63
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,920
and so that will naturally soften the mind

64
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,839
if our mindfulness is clear and equanimous

65
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,120
it will balance the mind

66
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,320
so the sit today will be largely silent

67
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,360
and the suggestion is that when the mind is somehow off balance

68
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,320
getting distracted or pulled into things

69
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,760
instead of trying to do anything about that

70
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,519
see if mindfulness alone will rebalance it just by knowing really clearly

71
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,120
what's going on in the mind

72
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:15,320
so exploring this inherently balancing nature of mindfulness

73
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,919
you

74
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,559
so practicing in this simple way

75
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,840
where mindfulness is helping to balance our mind

76
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,400
we can really see that this

77
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:11,840
act of noticing our experience is an act of care

78
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,460
sometimes it goes so far as to say seeing is loving

79
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,919
[Music]

80
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,159
there's so much in our experience that isn't seen clearly

81
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,159
and wants to be seen clearly and when it is it somehow gets

82
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,159
incorporated somehow gets balanced

83
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,799
so meditation is quite compassionate

84
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:27,200
and then this these qualities also move outward to

85
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,679
protect others sometimes directly sometimes more

86
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,398
indirectly

87
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:49,200
and certainly this sense of care that gets evoked through mindfulness

88
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,120
translates into treating others with harmlessness with

89
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,120
meta

90
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,720
there's really no way to only practice for ourselves

91
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,200
so you could reflect for a moment

92
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:28,278
how does your practice of mindfulness affect other people in your life

93
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,520
and also how might the way that you practice mindfulness

94
00:28:53,520 --> 00:29:00,080
serve to promote qualities that explicitly benefit others

95
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:07,200
things like patience or harmlessness loving kindness and sympathy

96
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:15,158
how does your practice of mindfulness help generate those qualities

97
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:50,970
[Music]

98
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:04,100
[Music] um

99
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,160
[Music]

100
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:31,279
okay so first um as noted there will be a community meeting today after the talk

101
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:37,760
and it will just start around 7 45 a.m pacific when we're done here

102
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,360
and that will be on zoom so you'll have to switch over to that

103
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,480
and the the link is on imc's homepage under

104
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,360
what's new and it's also on the imc calendar

105
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,799
and i tried to put it in the chat but it turns out it's i i can't do that easily

106
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:06,880
from the way i connect so i hope you can find it in one of those two places

107
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,799
and there's a password for it that i'll mention at the end

108
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:20,240
okay so this week we've explored a broad range

109
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,880
of how mindfulness can function as a protection it might be a simple

110
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,000
guarding of the scent stores and but it also has the potential to be very strong

111
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,480
and powerful such that one conquers that's what the texts say conquers states like fear and pain

112
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:47,120
and one becomes able to endure harsh words from others

113
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:53,360
so today we'll talk about how mindfulness serves as a protection

114
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,840
of oneself and others so both of those

115
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,240
together there's a suta called the sadaka suta that's about

116
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,600
an acrobat and his apprentice who do their stunts on a bamboo pole

117
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,919
and they're talking together about how to be protected while doing their work together

118
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,720
and it's a short suta so i'm actually just going to read it

119
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,840
on one occasion the blessed one was dwelling among the sumbas and there was

120
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:36,159
a town of the sumbas named sadaka there the blessed one addressed the

121
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:44,080
monks thus monks once in the past acrobat set up his bamboo pole and

122
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:50,559
addressed his apprentice made a catalica thus come dear apprentice

123
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:57,440
climb the bamboo pole and stand on my shoulders having replied yes teacher

124
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,720
the apprentice climbed up the bamboo pole and stood on the teacher's shoulders

125
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:11,200
the acrobat then said to the apprentice you protect me and all protect you. thus guarded by one

126
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,200
another protected by one another we'll display our skills collect our fee

127
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,720
and get down safely from the bamboo pole and when this was said

128
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:30,559
the apprentice replied that's not the way to do it teacher you protect yourself and i'll protect

129
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,919
myself thus each self-guarded and self-protected

130
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:43,039
will display our skills collect our fee and get down safely from the bamboo pole

131
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:50,080
that is the method there said the buddha it's just as the apprentice said to the teacher

132
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,360
i will protect myself thus should the establishments of mindfulness be

133
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,480
practiced i will protect others thus should the establishments of

134
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,240
mindfulness be practiced protecting oneself one protects others

135
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,878
protecting others one protects oneself and how is it monks that by protecting

136
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,398
oneself one protects others by the pursuit development and

137
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,440
cultivation of meditation it is in such a way that by protecting

138
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,280
oneself one protects others and how is it that by protecting others

139
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,280
one protects oneself by patience harmlessness loving kindness

140
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:42,960
and sympathy it is in such a way that by protecting others one protects oneself

141
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,638
i will protect myself thus should the establishments of mindfulness be practiced

142
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:56,398
i will protect others thus should the establishments of mindfulness be practiced

143
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,839
protecting oneself one protects others protecting others one protects oneself

144
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,280
it's a pretty interesting suta so i thought we would unpack this a bit

145
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:16,720
today so mindfulness brings protection for ourselves and for others

146
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:24,000
and i'll even add that it brings protection for the whole world in certain ways

147
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,560
so let's talk about sort of a number of main ways that can happen

148
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:36,560
so certainly mindfulness protects us from unmindful actions that are coming

149
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:43,760
from unwholesome motivations so at the kind of at the gross blunt end of the

150
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:50,480
spectrum this would include things like breaking precepts others are certainly affected by actions

151
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:57,359
like that and when we're mindless we we might do that or just more broadly

152
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:03,280
unskillful responses in general so if we're if our mind is caught up at

153
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,880
a certain time in sensual desire or lust for power or

154
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:15,200
anger or fear then we harm our relationships and we also harm

155
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:22,160
the social atmosphere of safety that can be created and so if the mind is caught up in these

156
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,359
things and we're not aware of that we might act on them and

157
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:33,359
do some harm and then maybe a little bit more subtly when we get

158
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,960
swept up by our views we might then impose those views on

159
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,880
others or act out our views unskillfully and that also goes in this

160
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,759
category of you know unmindful behavior

161
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,599
and of course i've been sort of implying that this is for the people that are affected directly

162
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,960
but in this media saturated world it's not only the people that we

163
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,160
directly relate to who are affected if we have misguided views or harmful

164
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,920
speech they can spread rapidly to a lot of other people certainly

165
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:18,640
even before this media saturated world history shows that even a small group of people who have a

166
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,160
particularly strong misguided view can sway a large number of people

167
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:29,359
inducing them also to do harmful actions

168
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:36,560
so that leads to the second main area of protection which is that mindfulness paves the way

169
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,920
for wisdom so um you know in a sort of a personal sense

170
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:49,760
we can clearly see and feel the harm that comes from unwholesomeness and when we can then it becomes natural to choose

171
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:57,119
the wholesome that's this balancing function that i talked about is that when we see actually the pain that's

172
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,240
caused say by being irritated then the mind will naturally want to

173
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,880
move into more balance but then also mindfulness makes our mind

174
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,960
more resilient and wise such that we are less influenced by harmful messages

175
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,359
coming in when we're mindful we are actually less likely to believe misinformation

176
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:28,320
and also though um sort of rumors that come that come in and so we become

177
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,680
clearer and more more capable of functioning as community

178
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,440
members as citizens and then in addition

179
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,520
we come to know through mindfulness we come to know our own mind and heart well

180
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,800
so that we can work skillfully with our own tendencies we start to know what our

181
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:57,520
particular little patterns are and and then how to counterbalance those so that they don't

182
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:04,320
bring harm to the world i went for a walk one time with a longtime practitioner

183
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:11,200
who i otherwise didn't know very well [Music] but we got into kind of an animated conversation about

184
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,480
the dharma and at one point uh he paused to say

185
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:24,560
my tone of voice can sound kind of authoritative when i get interested in a topic like i am right now so please know

186
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:32,079
that i'm not making strong declarative statements i'm actually quite open to inquiry and exploration

187
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:39,200
and i i was impressed that he said that so he knew himself well enough to know that his manner of expressing

188
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,640
deep engagement in a topic might come across to others as being a

189
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,400
little bit assertive or even sound close-minded so he was taking care to say that that's

190
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,920
not how he feels inside so he was showing good relational skill

191
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,200
and that kind of skill comes from close mindfulness from knowing ourselves

192
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:07,280
knowing our tendencies and then also in the realm of wisdom

193
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,839
as we come to see the universal truths of impermanence of

194
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:18,800
unsatisfactoriness of not self we're less inclined to grasp so tightly

195
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,720
onto one way of doing things and this flexibility makes us better

196
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,359
community members and leaders there's another pseudo where the buddha talks about qualities of a

197
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,480
good community members and one of them is wisdom

198
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,920
knowing the wisdom in particular of impermanence so as we see that everything changes and

199
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,200
it just becomes less important to grasp onto our particular way that we want to

200
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:53,078
do things and that makes things go better in a group

201
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,640
and then also through mindfulness we become stable for

202
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:07,920
others and i'm reminded here of a story that take not han tells about the

203
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:14,480
the vietnamese vote people of course there were many many other terrible conditions surrounding that

204
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:20,640
situation but what he was focusing in on in this story is that when there was

205
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,720
one person on the boat who was expressing uh calm and presence

206
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:32,000
um everybody on the boat would also feel calmer and that could make the

207
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,240
difference between really between life and death for those people if everybody panicked

208
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,760
the boat was likely to go over but if one person could could stay calm

209
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,599
then they had a chance so this is um you know another function of mindfulness

210
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:55,200
another great value that it offers the world and the buddha was clear that we you

211
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,800
know remember he favored what the apprentice said not what the teacher said so the apprentice said i'll look

212
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:07,440
out for myself you look out for yourself and in that way things you know will be able to stay

213
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:14,880
balanced so we take care of ourselves first in a sense like they say on the airplane you put on your own oxygen mask

214
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,440
before assisting others so um yeah this is this is how it can work how

215
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,720
it can work in a more broad way than just our own internal practice

216
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:33,359
so in in many different ways the benefits of mindfulness kind of spill out to support others also we can't help

217
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:40,400
it we're going to help others also and the the cultivation of mindfulness naturally brings forth

218
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:48,079
qualities that we might associate with protecting others so as the suta said patience harmlessness loving kindness

219
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,839
and sympathy and these qualities come about

220
00:42:53,839 --> 00:43:00,240
actually kind of naturally through the development of meditation that's the game changer because we see in ourselves

221
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:06,079
we see our suffering we see our patterns we have to soften up and work with that

222
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,359
and care about that and love that and then that translates into

223
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:17,920
treating others the same way when we see those qualities in them it's not that much difference between internal and

224
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,760
external as practice goes along so but we do need to meditate to create

225
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:30,079
enough depth and stability that we can protect both ourselves and others

226
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:35,680
so i want to um quote now from nyanaponakatera

227
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,040
who has done a nice analysis of this suta about the acrobats

228
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:47,200
and he comes to the conclusion that it relates to what are called the wings of

229
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:53,440
awakening so he says self-protection and protection of others correspond to the

230
00:43:53,440 --> 00:44:00,560
great twin virtues of buddhism wisdom and compassion i shall protect myself

231
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:06,000
thus should we establish our mindfulness and guided by it devote ourselves to the

232
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,760
practice of meditation for the sake of our own liberation i shall protect others

233
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:18,560
thus should we establish our mindfulness and guided by it regulate our conduct by patience

234
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,920
harmlessness loving-kindness and compassion for the welfare and happiness

235
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:30,160
of many so it's quite beautiful what we're doing

236
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,880
we kind of can't help ending up benefiting the world and if we make that explicit in our way of being

237
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,920
through the balance of wisdom and compassion we can really

238
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,839
discover the potential of the human heart the great potential that we have the potential of this practice

239
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:55,359
for bringing about so much benefit in this world that it so much needs it

240
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:01,520
so thank you thank you for your practice and it's inspiring to me

241
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:07,359
to been here this whole week with you so um

242
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:13,920
so thus ends our exploration of the images of mindfulness and some of the

243
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,599
i think the kind of broader context in which this practice situates

244
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:25,119
itself and with that you can dive back in next week with gil and looking at the four

245
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,839
fourth foundation of mindfulness he'll be going through some of the other qualities and practices that are in that

246
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:37,920
final final foundation of mindfulness so thank you

247
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:46,480
so we're moving now into the community meeting and as i said the zoom
