the joy of being here being here and now and tuning into the joy of being here

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,640
and now exactly as it is as one of the Brahma viharas the the

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,780
four heavenly abodes the four practices of the heart meta loving kindness being the first one

delight Joy taking Delight in our own Good Fortune taking joy in other

18
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,939
people's Good Fortune it's just such a generous way to go through life this

19
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,880
sense of joy for what is good here what's good elsewhere so

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,340
this activating cultivating this this to Joy

21
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,640
or ourselves being right here right now and

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,640
and I mentioned I think a couple of nights ago this term for us to cultivate

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:28,319
Jomo the joy of missing out instead of the fear of missing out fomo fomo is so

24
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:35,459
common in in our culture this fear of missing out and this this sense of Envy

25
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:41,160
like I want what other people have whereas in this practice we cultivate

26
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,680
the joy of being right here right now loving the sense of presence

27
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:54,239
and the gift of presence calms as much as it might be

28
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:01,319
available but just the gift of presence and being in this body with all its gifts and challenges

29
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:10,260
exploring the joy of this and and a way of gently letting go of

30
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:17,220
whatever else might be happening because at any time in the world so many things are happening of course and we can't be

31
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,680
everywhere um all the time and yet if we are right

32
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,140
here and taking delight and joy in the sense of presence right here it can be

33
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,900
so delicious we don't have to be in the past in the future anywhere else this is

34
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:40,379
the most delicious most joyous most nourishing place to be

35
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:45,900
right here in our hearts so so that's what I would like to invite us to to

36
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,019
contemplate and cultivate Jomo the joy of being here just here the joy of

37
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,720
missing out on everything else may all beings be well happy may they have joy

38
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,080
in whatever they're doing in in the midst of their presence in their moments

39
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,920
of being aliveness so so it's really a Counter Culture Act of cultivating Jomo

40
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:19,739
instead of follow so we're counter-cultural here in a way cultivating peace ease and joy Delight

41
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:25,380
in what is right here so so that's my little darmet and I'll

42
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,720
share some invitations as we practice so let's begin

00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:30,899
about the state of mental health of of the young people especially due to

124
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:36,000
social media use which really brings up a sense of formal fear of missing out

125
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,419
being here there is really the opposite of that is the joy of being just here so

and just being here in one place oh kill says not much conversation in

161
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,018
our group everyone was too calm and relaxed

162
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:34,019
that makes me smile and laugh it's just that's the contentment right not not

163
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:39,720
much needs to be said like oh yeah we're just happy to be here together we're holding we're being in community

164
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:46,740
together so that's sweet and of course if your group was more talkative and sharing that's perfectly fine too it's

165
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:52,860
all good it's all good so any Reflections you like to share especially

166
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:58,380
if you tend to pull back and not speak much what's happy hour you're invited if

167
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,740
you like

168
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:12,780
what did you discover in this practice the joy of just being here or the joy of missing out is quite counter-cultural

169
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:20,220
Reflections complaints what the heck do you mean by Joy of

170
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:26,638
missing out I hope I already explained it but anyway uh oh you're sweet Don

171
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:33,378
says Nikki you're awesome thank you Don you're awesome thank you for your practice

172
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:41,700
fossil please hi thank you I um

173
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:48,300
I just every moment just being here and

174
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:54,480
you know following the instructions to see the joy and being here just brought it a sense of gratitude for

175
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,660
every moment as A Moment Like an opportunity to to learn how to deal with the next

176
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:08,400
moment in the next moment the next that was nice thank you Father ah I'm feeling into the

177
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:17,160
the space of gratitude that you took us in to with in into which with with your

178
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:23,220
reflection because you are speaking from that space of gratitude at this moment and then this moment and this moment

179
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:28,700
thank you this was lovely swazil

180
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:36,000
Jean please I just found that to be really Blissful

181
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:43,500
and um I and I I think it was helped by my heating pad and the sun coming in my

182
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,680
window and um I was just so happy to cultivate that with your guidance but I I found

183
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:57,480
myself wondering what if my neighbor's music was cranked up or I was feeling chronic pain and I

184
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:04,560
know there's various different instructions yeah included about how to sit with pain Etc but in this in

185
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:10,800
particular this Jomo um how do we take it to those times when

186
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,380
things aren't optimal absolutely thank you for this question Gene and somebody

187
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:23,520
else also sent this just uh now in chat so I'm going to combine the question you

188
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,820
asked with theirs let me read it out loud could you remind us of the joy of being with difficult moments I have

189
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:36,180
experienced it briefly as impermanence of those moments but could use a refresher beautiful yeah thank you for

190
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:42,240
both of those questions both Gene and the anonymous questions so

191
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,980
so um when we are with not just the pleasant

192
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:57,420
moments or or the neutral moments the joy of of those are more apparent to us

193
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:03,240
but when something difficult is happening something difficult in the

194
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,460
body or some difficult emotion there is a

195
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:15,480
a dignity there is a dick it feels dignified there is it there is a joy and

196
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:22,140
I'm going to call it the joy there's a sense of dignity to be with what is difficult instead of pushing it away

197
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:27,240
instead of being antagonistic with it and instead of fighting with it or

198
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,660
hating it or pushing it away to make space for what is difficult and being

199
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:39,060
with what is here that the body relaxes the heart relaxes

200
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:44,760
um to open up to what is here and

201
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,520
um having having worked with a lot of physical pain myself in my practice

202
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,859
there and and even now as I'm speaking with you yeah the body is tired and achy

203
00:37:55,859 --> 00:38:04,380
and quiet actually yeah achy right now and then there is there is this Joy of opening up to it ah the heart relaxes my

204
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,540
heart is relaxing as I'm opening up to yeah this body is really hurting right

205
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:14,940
now and it's okay there's just if I was hating it and I wish it didn't hurt and

206
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:21,839
it was would be terrible ouch ouch ouch is the double it's all the second and third and fourth arrows

207
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:27,480
but where I'm actually opened up to a there's a joy there's a delight there's

208
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:33,660
a dignity there's a uh a brightness of being present with what is difficult so

209
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:40,859
the joy can actually be present with the difficulty and this blows our mind away

210
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:46,560
I remember when I discovered this at first from myself the Opposites being

211
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:53,940
present at the same time it doesn't have to be just pain or just Joy both of them can be present at the same time and

212
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:59,400
there's so many invitations in Buddhism to ex to experience the Opposites at the

213
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:05,820
same time it's it's it's blown my mind away to be able to do that

214
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:12,180
um and that the mind is able to hold both of these dichotomies you can feel

215
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:18,839
for example uh feel heaviness and lightness you know it's like either oh either heaviness of the body or the

216
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:24,060
lightness but no actually the mind can open up to to both at the same time and

217
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:30,540
it blows your mind when you see that's possible or joy and sorrow joy and and

218
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:35,700
pain at the same time Your Capacity expands so

219
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:44,520
foreign so that's what I would like to share and uh that is that is that helpful Gene

220
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:53,040
you're well yes okay good okay good enough okay great um and also the person who sent it in in

221
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,119
uh chat you're welcome to save that that's that hopefully opens something up for you

222
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,900
Peggy please

223
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:11,760
um you actually just spoke to everything I was experiencing uh thank you although mine wasn't quite

224
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,180
as um trifling enthusiastic as you sound um just a lot

225
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:25,440
of resistance and but there was a dignity about coming back coming back and it is not what I

226
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,440
wanted to do I wanted to leave the beginning many times but um so it was

227
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:38,940
interesting and and there were moments of joy and that sense of dignity and also that

228
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:45,060
that muscle can grow by by being here when I don't want to you well part of me

229
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:51,960
doesn't want to in those opposites that you mentioned so I really appreciate that night a lot of

230
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:59,280
those things came to mind from all the previous happy hours I've been to and just to try to have

231
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,460
some kindness towards all those dimensions of self non-self

232
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:12,960
beautiful thank you Peggy thank you so much for your practice report I I I'm loving you

233
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,619
reporting the the push and pull that I don't want to be here I want to leave I'm just going to leave happy now stay

234
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:24,660
stay dear I'll stay come back with this difficulty stay and then there is just

235
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:29,900
as you said there is a sense of um dignity there is a sense of dignity

236
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:35,160
and oh yeah I'm here and then there's the sense of expansion of the heart that

237
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:41,640
oh I stayed and then there are the there are moments of Joy just as you've said they're moments of joy of staying of

238
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,859
knowing oh actually there is a sense of trust that grows oh yes it is possible

239
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:52,920
it is possible for me to stay with and make space for make

240
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,680
space for what is challenging and it loses its power what it's challenging it

241
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:06,900
loses its power a little bit it softens it a little bit it's still here but it doesn't have the megaphone to scream all

242
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:15,119
right it just it can be present along with other things yeah yay and you're here you may you you

243
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:21,900

245
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,800
dignity in that thank you for your practice and and your practice report sharing with others

246
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:41,339
yeah and Claire it's the last one before we close

247
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:47,460
thank you I was going to share something actually very similar it's funny you would bring this up it happened on

248
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:55,020
Friday I'm in a new job and something went terribly wrong that was the result of my not doing something yeah it was

249
00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:01,980
not a good thing um and you know I offered to help and didn't get any takers

250
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:09,420
and I went back to my desk and I was perfectly okay in the past I would have fallen apart I

251
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:15,780
would have just been this big Heap on the desk and said I calm down and I knew

252
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:21,540
it would work out and you know it wasn't all my fault and it but it was like

253
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:27,359
being two people and I was I was sitting there and I couldn't figure out what was going on because I'd never felt like

254
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:33,240
this before in a catastrophe and I was just sitting there this is so strange I

255
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:39,960
feel perfectly fine and I'm sure it was exactly what you're talking about that was a beautiful

256
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:47,220
experience actually Claire this is lovely I felt responsible but I didn't feel

257
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:52,800
like I was gonna die you know oh my God that and would detail I see people who

258
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,260
are who are just share you know hearts are coming on the zoom space

259
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:04,740
um bill says Claire I've experienced that at work too it's great yes as you said so you still feel responsible of

260
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:12,000
course you feel responsible but as you said you don't feel like you're gonna die it's not you know it's not a sense

261
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,119
of panic and sense of oh this is awful and all the like yeah something is wrong

262
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:24,480
but there's a sense of equanimity and because actually especially when there is equanimity we can take more

263
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:31,260
responsibility instead of beating ourselves up because we can really help out when we're

264
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:36,300
completely devastated and we're in fight or flight or freeze but when we have

265
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:42,920
this calmness and it feels strange at first oh beautiful

266
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:50,040
yay thanks so much for sharing that this just makes me so happy thank you well

267
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:57,000
this is so great this is so lovely thank you thanks Claire and then um well it says such a good reminder

268
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,400
that change is possible and this practice creates change over time yes

269
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,800

270
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:15,599
of Reflections from our YouTube Friends thank you for the practice a question came up for me oh I think this is maybe

271
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:22,380
this was an earlier one I didn't see if we experience pain and suffering in the present moment how can we practice bringing joy to it oh yeah I already
