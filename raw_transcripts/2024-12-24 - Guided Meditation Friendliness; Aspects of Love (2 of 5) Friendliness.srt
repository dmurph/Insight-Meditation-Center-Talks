1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:10,320
so good morning everyone or good day Welcome to

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,400
our morning or meditation on this 24th of

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,720
December and what I'd like to evoke for this day

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,199
is the the general attitude of friendliness

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,800
friendliness in the most ordinary ways the ways you'd be friendly to someone

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:45,120
and a stranger maybe in a public space maybe the person in front of you in the grocery store who in line and maybe they

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,800
drop their one of their purchases on the floor you pick it

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,359
up for them and hand it to them and they say thank you and the exchange is all

9
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:03,080
ordinary simple friendliness nothing really required more than just the

10
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:09,640
ACT maybe opening a door for someone again maybe a stranger maybe opening the door for a

11
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,560
stranger and wishing them well have a good day or

12
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:24,520
please and so uh the idea of friendliness and maybe there's a simpler

13
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,880
word that you might like to use I don't know if kindness is simpler

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,159
uh maybe a simple Goodwill a general sense of well-wishing

15
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:44,560
an attitude of well-wishing rather than attitude of ill will or suspicion or

16
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,640
fear and so to have that as the basis for

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,320
meditation there are some people who will do meta meditation the meditation on good will for the first few minutes

18
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,680
of meditation to set the stage set the foundation for meditation itself to be a

19
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:13,520
very simple Act of friend of goodwi of friendliness to oneself or to one's

20
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,680
experience as one is meditating a friendly attitude towards

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,840
breathing friendly attitude to discomfort in the body a friendly

22
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,400
attitude to calm that might set in a friendly attitude

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,959
to a mind that's out of control not punitive to the mind not

24
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:43,599
aversive to it but in a friendly way opening the door and welcoming it in

25
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,599
Back to the present moment please please enter come

26
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:59,080
here begin again so to assume a meditation posture

27
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,640
maybe there's a way in which the posture itself can be an expression of the

28
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,120
simplest form of well-wishing or

29
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:26,720
friendliness to place oneself in a posture which is

30
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,319
aligned a posture in which different parts of

31
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:39,400
the body can be aligned or in harmony

32
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,640
or be in a kind of Cooperative

33
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,480
balance lowering your gaze

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,159
and if it's comfortable to close your

35
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:18,239
eyes and feeling the weight of your body down through your

36
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,440
torso through your back through your sitting bones if

37
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,720
you're on a chair couch or cushion

38
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,400
maybe the weight of your feet wherever whatever they're

39
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:54,199
touching and that in that weight in that this substantial feeling of being in a

40
00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:01,560
body may it contain within it a simple friendly less an attitude of

41
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,360
care or

42
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,840
kindness some people connect to kindness more through [Music]

43
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,280
words saying very simple kind

44
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,599
words classically it's may I be happy

45
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,800
for some people it's more having an image of something that's easy someone

46
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,000
or some animal or something that's easy to be delighted in and to have a

47
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Simple Kindness good will for some people it's somatic

48
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,360
a Radiance of tenderness or

49
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:18,440
warmth some people it's a light that shines

50
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:31,440
outward that maybe also shines inward maybe the light of awareness

51
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,759
so that everything awareness touches and everything that comes into

52
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,800
awareness is touched by

53
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:53,919
kindness is received in a friendly way

54
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,879
and then centering yourself on your body

55
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:25,680
breathing and maybe if it's comfortable for you that

56
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,520
breathing becomes the subject for your kindness

57
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:40,720
breathing becomes the place where you remember to be

58
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,840
friendly to be kind to be warmhearted

59
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:56,120
breathing as the training ground for MEA

60
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:18,360
friendly to breathing in Friendly to the one who's

61
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,840
breathing friendly to breathing

62
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,560
out caring for the one who exhales

63
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:41,399
maybe appreciating the breathing keeps you

64
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,640
alive so why

65
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,839
not Center your Good Will on

66
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,959

67

now

68
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320

69

73

e

74

for e

83
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,440
one way to support a friendly attitude

84
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,559
is to have a half Smile as you

85
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:14,039
meditate turning up your corners of your lips just

86
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:18,039
enough to feel some

87
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:31,640
pleasure and another way is to gently quietly sit say the word

88
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,520
yes the friendly

89
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:45,720
yes both a smile and a

90
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:56,559
yes that reassures the thinking mind that it's okay to be

91
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,320
quiet to be

92
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
still

93
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

94
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

95
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

96
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

97
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

98
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

99
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

100
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

101
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440

peace thank

134
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,039
you e

135
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:56,600
so hello everyone and welcome to this December 24th

136
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:03,519
2024 and and um this week the themes is care all the

137
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:09,320
different forms of Love or the five primary forms of love

138
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:17,080
in Buddhism in the kind of terad Buddhism and so yesterday was care which

139
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,760
I see as the foundation for the other four and when we care for something we

140
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:28,480
value it we tend to it we nourish it nurture it

141
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,960
that um one of the ways one of the ways that's expressed is in

142
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:41,080
friendliness and the word meta is a cognate to the word uh M so it's closely

143
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:48,039
connected friendliness and friendship and friend sometimes it's translated as

144
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:55,799
kindness Good Will loving kindness well wishing and um sometimes you know it

145
00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:01,279
said that maybe the common English trans ation loving kindness puts a high bar on

146
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:08,039
it because the word love for some people is challenging when we have people who are quite difficult in our

147
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:16,240
lives and um but uh the idea of friendliness or good willll maybe kind

148
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,559
of makes it easier more accessible that even uh to someone we

149
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:28,600
have trouble with that it might be some very basic friendliness or Goodwill that

150
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:35,080
uh that might work and um but it's a one wonderful

151
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:41,960
things to be friendly it's a lower bar than loving someone maybe it's an easier

152
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:50,039
than being um compassionate for people at times and also it's more universally

153
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:55,320
applicable to go through the day being friendly is more appropriate than going

154
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:02,000
through the world with compassion certainly the world is full of suffering but uh not everyone wants to

155
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,039
receive our compassion not everyone it's the time and place to be compassionate but it's every place is a

156
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:15,440
time and place for simple friendliness I have been involved in

157
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,840
I've been uh seen and that uh sometimes when there's uh a

158
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:31,440
lot of animosity and directed towards me or seen directed to other people a lot of anger I've seen uh um people who were

159
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:38,639
able to receive it without fear and Without Anger to turn it all around by

160
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:47,760
being friendly and idea of being able to step towards and look with Care on the World

161
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,679
to not turn away uh but to uh look towards what's

162
00:33:53,679 --> 00:34:01,279
happening and see it with the friendly eyes at least there's a caring

163
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:07,399
eyes and um and you can ask why or when

164
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:13,440
is it appropriate to be friendly and the most profound answer that I

165
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,599
could offer is um the the time to be

166
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:24,720
friendly is when the alternative is worse if you know a better alternative

167
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,839
than being friendly then by all means please do it but if the alternative you

168
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:37,560
have is not as good as being friendly choose friendliness above all else this

169
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:42,800
is what the Buddha said uh the uh the concept or the

170
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,040
attitude of meta is really in the ancient teachings of the Buddha the

171
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:54,599
primary social emotion next to anukampa care that is emphasized and many of the

172
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:02,000
ways in later Buddhism and in the modern Buddhism compassion is often seen as the primary

173
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,720
Buddhist uh motivation and attitude uh the place of that for many of the same

174
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,839
purposes and reasons and motivations in the ancient text was meta Good Will to

175
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,040
meet others with Good Will to meet them with friendliness and the Buddha

176
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:28,599
emphasized to be very careful and not sacrifice not give it up no matter what's happening stay close to me

177
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:33,839
and then he's talking to his monastic disciples he said the way that you stay

178
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:39,839
true to the Dharma is no matter what's happening you keep uh meta for the

179
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,880
people that are um you know even the people who are abusing

180
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,160
you this is a very difficult teaching but with what I want to emphasize is how

181
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:58,880
foundational the idea of friendliness and kindness is in this tradition

182
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,040
um the um I have uh kind of a warm place

183
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,119
in my heart for a neighbor here who's an old man who's having quite a bit of

184
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:17,079
difficulty uh and um uh he went to the hospital recently and I tried to best I

185
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:22,640
could to figure out how to support him and help him it was a bit hard but when

186
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,359
I went to talk to the neighbors next to him um they had only animal for him he

187
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:35,359
said he's just a bad person he's always mean and he's never been here for you know I've been here for 27 years and

188
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:44,359
together with him and he's always been difficult and I replied that um oh uh

189
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:51,720
yes half the time he's been a difficult neighbor but the other half of the time he's not and I emphasized the half a

190
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:59,480
time that he's not and um and uh I have a soft spot my for him and would like to

191
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:08,359
support him wanted to try to be there when he went to the hospital and offer the support I could and um and so not to hold against

192
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:17,480
him the fact that he has this mean streak um because it doesn't really you

193
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:24,000
know affect me that he's mean um but it does affect me if I

194
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,560
am it doesn't really matter to to me whether he's mean to me it matters that

195
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,760
uh to me that I keep my heart open and one of the profound things that I've

196
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:44,800
learned from Buddhist practice a surprise to me not something I tried to talk myself into or kind of snuck up on

197
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:51,319
me was the realization that in theory or

198
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:59,160
in in some real way not not easy but in a real way um I was capable of having

199
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:06,680
good will friendliness to everyone and no matter what and uh and

200
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:13,040
so the practice was and the commitment was to find a way to make that possible

201
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,839
to do it in a way that was safe for me safe for others that was appropriate but

202
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:25,119
always at least in my heart to keep my heart open never close my heart even

203
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:31,800
there are times where I've had to leave a situation because of the danger I had to protect myself because of the danger

204
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,440
that was there from other people um but I the idea was always even so with my

205
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:44,560
heart keep it friendly have good will there uh as I care for

206
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:52,680
myself so in our Buddhist tradition there are uh four primary kind of

207
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:58,599
practices or attitudes or approaches to life that is the uh I understand is the

208
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:04,079
foundation of it all one has to do with awareness practices like

209
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:10,760
mindfulness the second has to do with um U ethics being

210
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:17,000
ethical the third has to do with generosity and the fourth has to do with

211
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,440
Good Will with kindness those are the those are the four kind of

212
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:30,520
primary uh attitudes approaches teachings that terad Buddhism that I

213
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:36,599
like to think of swims in that that that's the world which we are centering

214
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:42,079
ourselves are guiding Us in how we live and it's a world that brings a lot of

215
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:49,359
Joy a lot of love a lot of sense of being being

216
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:55,440
like we belong in this world we belong in this in this Society we belong in

217
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:02,560
such a way that we can include others in that belonging and even though if we feel

218
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:09,079
like we don't belong because of how others treat us it's possible through these four

219
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:15,280
practices of awareness ethics generosity and Good

220
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:23,560
Will to feel centered and at home with oneself enough that now you become the

221
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:31,880
belonger that your friendliness is one that welcomes everyone uh uh to

222
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,480
um into your field of friendliness it doesn't have to be naive

223
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:46,079
it doesn't have to put you in danger it can be at whatever distance that's appropriate for you and but that's

224
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,119
that's the nature of your heart it's possible to have a heart of Good

225
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:57,880
Will and finally to end as you go forth today

226
