1
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:07,279
greetings friends greetings to you

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,880
from wherever in the world we are joining each other in this moment in time

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:22,680
I hope you are well and uh delighted to be exploring practices and

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,939
compassion cultivation this week together so so as I mentioned on the first day uh

5
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,520
and as many of you know um cultivating compassion happens the

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,040
practice is offered in growing concentric circles we start with

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,399
ourselves then the next category where we expand our heart is benefactors and

8
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:54,480
dear friends which we did that yesterday uh we put them together those two categories and then the next category

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,360
which is a very important category in this exploration in this growing

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:09,119
expanding our heart is the category of the neutral being the neutral being

11
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,939
and basically this category is someone we don't know very well and when we

12
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:22,320
cultivate compassion for them we tune into sense of compassion for

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,860
someone we don't know very well and the significance of this is that this

14
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,579
person can become will become the standard for all of humanity and this category actually some people find it

15
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:43,320
easier uh sometimes than the other categories even because we don't have any history with this person so it might

16
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,759
actually turn out to be easier so so you'll see for yourself so let's uh

17
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,700
let's practice together let's begin together

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,159
ah Landing in this body notice if you need

19
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:09,319
to shift or move to be more comfortable to to sit upright

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,319
what does your body need in this moment to be comfortable

21
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,080
you feel grounded to fear here

22
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,920
feeling your feet on the earth your legs on the earth if you're sitting on a

23
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,580
cushion creating your sit bones

24
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,080
your bottom on the cushion

25
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,500
the magnet to the Earth

26
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:27,660
and connecting receiving the breath receiving the breath

27
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,900
in the abdomen let us receive three deep diaphragmatic

28
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,860
breaths to help us arrive arrive fully and settle

29
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,758
maybe breathing in in five counts holding in

30
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,240
for three counts and letting go for five counts available

31
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,860
here we go together

32
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,840
and this time breathing in one two three

33
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:19,820
four five holding one two three

34
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:25,440
releasing the breath one two three four

35
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,039
five and one more time in your own timing

36
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,120
not letting the breath be natural but continue to connect with the entirety of

37
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,699
in-breath the pause and the out breath

38
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,320
getting embodied

39
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,860
and now bringing to mind bringing to Heart

40
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,960
someone you've seen you've met

41
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,120
perhaps you have even interacted with but you don't know very well

42
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,580
this person could be maybe someone who works at a grocery

43
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:03,840
store [Music] Barista homes made your coffee or

44
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,120
or maybe even a neighbor you've seen walked around

45
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,759
you've seen them but you haven't interacted perhaps past to seeing them or saying hello

46
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:37,159
bring this person to your mind and see them as clearly as possible

47
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:46,880
or feel them as much as possible and we had this interaction

48
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:55,040
maybe they're the receptionist at the doctor's office if you're still going through

49
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,920
the list to find someone it's okay to have a little bit of liking

50
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:09,120
or tiny bit of disliking it's fine it doesn't have to be completely neutral this neutral person but someone we don't

51
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,260
have a lot to straight with

52
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:23,120
relatively neutral person bring them to mind

53
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:38,700
now this this person just like me

54
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,980
their life is dear to them

55
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,839
just like me they have a very

56
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,480
compelling [Music] internal life

57
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:04,140
the life of the Mind likes dislikes

58
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:09,959
thoughts just like me they have hopes and dreams

59
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:17,580
aspirations just like me they suffer they have

60
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:23,220
suffered their body aches

61
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,260
because they have a body their body ages gets sick

62
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:35,600
has gotten sick they've had pain they've had loss in their life just like me

63
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:43,019
they might have lost people they love at disappointments defeats

64
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,440
they felt lonely sad depressed

65
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:58,820
they've also felt Joy happiness just like me

66
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,120
they're people they love

67
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,120
and hold dear and this being is an object of affection

68
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:17,060
of someone else so someone really loves and cares about this person

69
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,160
they might even like something we like if we like particular vegetable or

70
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:33,180
flavor of ice cream let's imagine the two of us liking the same thing just for

71
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,279
the sake of imagination or frozen yogurt or whatever it might be

72
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,760
your food

73
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,880
they are not so different this person and I

74
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,899
We're Not So Different than just as I wish to be happy

75
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:17,220
just as I wish to be happy this person just wants to be happy

76
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:23,220
as well they don't want to suffer just like me they don't want to suffer

77
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,240
they want to be happy

78
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:50,160
for the purpose of this particular practice it's okay to use our imagination for a moment perhaps imagine

79
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,040
them suffering in the same way we have if we've had an illness or disappointment

80
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,880
or loss

81
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,399
maybe you've lost a loved one and they too have lost their loved one we both

82
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,000
grieve together in the same ways

83
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:30,839
and just as we want to be free we want to have ease and peace and not

84
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,880
suffer we wish them well

85
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,519
just as I don't want to suffer

86
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:48,560
and have ease I wish you freedom from suffering I wish you ease

87
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:02,480

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,820
to ease my challenges I wish the same for you

89
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:18,660
keeping them in mind connecting to their image to their felt

90
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:25,019
sense their Humanity just as compelling

91
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:32,399
their life just as dear to them to other people just as yours is

92
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,440
they are a dear person

93
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,800
and knowing that they too suffer

94
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:55,760

gladdening of the Mind and heart to hold someone else with care

110
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:55,700
acknowledging their challenges see if you can tune into it

111
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,620
instead of tuning a radio

112
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,960
and notice you your mind gets lost or distracted

113
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,360
stay with the image of the person

114
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,400

115
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:13,759

can the heart feel expansive its own expansiveness it is available

121
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,080

141
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:21,600
as they keep coming in yeah

142
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,539
so as we continue to explore the practice of cultivating compassion this

143
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:33,299
week and and the systematic way that it has been taught

144
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:39,840
um as we start with categories that are we're more connected to better connected

145
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:46,440
to ourselves our benefactors dear beings and then we move to this category that

146
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:54,960
we just explored in the meditation which is the neutral uh person neutral person then we

147
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,200
connect cultivate our care for someone we don't really know we don't have a lot

148
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:08,820
of experience with a lot of background a lot of history with their

149
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:15,360
um and this category is a very very important category

150
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,419
because up to now the categories as we expand the heart categories are people

151
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:27,059
we know we know ourselves kind of we keep discovering ourselves but we kind of know ourselves we spend more time

152
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:33,179
with ourselves than anyone else oh our benefactors are good friends Etc so it's it's it's

153
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:39,840
um so far we've been in the known territory and now the neutral person is is the

154
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,659
cusp is a very important transition to the next few categories it's really the

155
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:53,700
building block it's this the the most important step to the next expansions of the heart so important to step

156
00:32:53,700 --> 00:33:00,179
this category this neutral category and and as we engage with with the

157
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:07,200
neutral person which you might have noticed after a while practicing with the

158
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:15,120
neutral person they don't stay neutral anymore our hearts start to care Hearts start to

159
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,159
expand and I have lots of stories which which I have shared before practicing

160
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:26,580
within neutral category for a while and and the person becomes so dear becomes

161
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:32,820
so dear um like like his sister like I I in a

162
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:39,539
way that I would in my heart my heart wouldn't know the difference between who used to be the neutral person who I

163
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:46,260
didn't even know I hadn't spoken to a word um and and my best friend

164
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:51,539
um my sister it just know there's there's no difference in my heart

165
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:58,440
um so these categories are very very and it's not just me this is this is this is the classical teaching

166
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:05,279
um that actually I'll I'll give you since I shared with this with you I'll I'll tell you there

167
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:10,980
is a there is a um there's a test you know when we have these mid final tests

168
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:17,220
the final exam of practicing um uh these practices of the heart let's

169
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:22,618
say compassion when you practice it intensely for a

170
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:29,878
long time say on a retreat or a really dedicated dedicate your heart to it for for a period of time

171
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:37,800
um the the test is um we haven't got to the people we have challenges with but the test is when

172
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:45,480
um uh you imagine that that you know this is

173
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,960
from classical language you imagine that you're on a trip and the bandits and and you're on a carriage you're in the

174
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,960
carriage with your with your dear being you know dear person

175
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,720
um and with your neutral person and the person you're having challenges with the person who's really pushing your buttons

176
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:09,780
the four of you are in a carriage you're going somewhere and the bandits stop you and they

177
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:16,859
get you out and they ask you okay um which you know one of you you have to

178
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:23,400
give up one of you one of you you have to give up uh whom whom are you gonna give up and then in your heart you try

179
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:29,280
to figure out whom are you going to give up are you going to give up yourself well you're you're dear to yourself your

180
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,500
life is dear your your dear person of course they're dear to you you're a neutral person you realize oh yes you

181
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:41,040
practice with them they're dear and then you're the person you have been challenging you've had challenges with also not condoning the challenges we'll

182
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,800
talk more about that tomorrow but but you know there is there's an affinity there's a lot there's a care there's a

183
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,440
love So you you're not able to choose anyone uh at that point that's the real

184
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:57,780
the blossoming the blossoming of this practice but the point really is that

185
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:04,020
these categories as you might have just explored you might have realized even today with the short short time that

186
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:10,020
we've done this is that these categories are ephemeral

187
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:17,400
they they they keep changing they're transient they're Anita they're impermanent it's it's we don't see

188
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:25,820
people as they are we see people as we are so so when we have kindness compassion

189
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:31,619
uh ease gentleness we tend to like people we tend to it's so so we and and

190
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:36,839
we can cultivate it's not just that it's this is the way you are and you can't shift and change and this is the way

191
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:43,380
you're for the rest of you like this is the cultivation this is an absolute cultivation or attitude and and the way

192
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:49,020
our stands towards other people um neutral people people we have

193
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:55,140
challenges with again I'll talk a lot more about that tomorrow so so so uh we'll save that because that's a very

194
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:00,839
juicy category and yet the this category of the the neutral person is really the

195
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:07,800
step the the um the the necessary step to to to work to to expand our hearts and have

196
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:13,800
Equanimity and peace and care for the people um we have challenges with but staying

197
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:21,180
with this category today few things a few other things I want to say so so our hearts shift and expand

198
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:27,000
and the person who was once relatively neutral is not neutral anymore we start

199
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,140
to care for them and as I mentioned I know for me and and many many many practitioners who I've interacted with

200
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:41,640
this is this is true this is what happens oh I remember once I practiced um with a someone who looked at the uh

201
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:47,960
worked at the laundromat and every time I walked by that uh uh the not laundromat the

202
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,220
cleaners yes cleaners every time I was curious if she was there she was like oh

203
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:59,640
my goodness my heart would leap this this neutral person had become a dear friend I was so happy to to take my

204
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,680
clothes there so so um he's the heart is so expansive the

205
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:10,800
heart is so expensive who we decide to care for or not it's it's all it's so

206
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,260
elastic it's so elastic and another thing of course we realized that we're

207
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:22,140
all the same we are we all want to be happy us human beings we want to be

208
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:27,420
happy we don't want to suffer all of our lives our our internal lives are just as

209
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:34,380
compelling to us my life this richness of thinking or this and that and the whole day I have thoughts and intentions

210
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:41,160
and and aspirations oh yeah other people have them too duh it's you know if we

211
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,200
stop to realize I realize how similar we are and through that common Humanity we

212
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:52,200
can have love and care for one another and again as I mentioned briefly earlier

213
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:58,920
another importance of this category is that um that neutral person becomes the the

214
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:04,200
stand-in for all of humanity so when we expand to all beings at the end it's

215
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:11,220
it's there there are our hearts connect with being with this person as oh yeah

216
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:16,320
and this person too and this person too and I'm not so separate from that person so

217
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,599
um this is profound practice and when I discovered this in I was not born a

218
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,820
Buddhist um and I've discovered these practices it's just my heart my mind I would say

219
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:32,460
my mind has been blown but my heart has been blown so powerful so powerful

220
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:39,180
um another thing I want to bring in today is I had mentioned uh I yesterday about

221
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:44,820
the the near enemies of of compassion

222
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:52,079
and yesterday uh I talked about um empathic distress empathic distress

223
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:59,760
or or falling into grief as a near enemy or as a masquerader of compassion

224
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:07,079
something that feels like compassion but actually it's not compassion it's it's very different from it today I want to

225
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:13,859
talk about another near enemy another uh near enemy or another

226
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:22,160
masquerade or something that masquerades as compassion but it's not compassion and that is pity pity is not compassion

227
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:30,599
at all so the simplest way to understand the difference here is pity is where we

228
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:35,760
have a less than you know like oh poor you oh you're going through this hard

229
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,540
time oh poor you oh so we have this I'm up here I'm I'm not going through this

230
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:49,320
I'm I'm okay and oh you poor you so there's a less that there is a comparison like I wouldn't I'm not going

231
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:55,500
through that or I would never go through that versus there's a separation basically there's a separation you're separating yourself from the other

232
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,540
person from up here like oh poor you I feel I feel compassionate but for you

233
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:04,700
but this actually is pity foreign

234
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:12,119
yes we're equal I feel your pain this this could be me this was me this can't

235
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:19,619
be me in the future or I feel your pain We're Not So Different this can happen to me it's it's their sense of there's

236
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:25,079
no separation there is a um kinship there is a kinship in this

237
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:30,119
feeling of of kindness of this feeling of compassion and warmth or as pity

238
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:35,820
there's a sense of uh putting in in our minds perhaps even not not

239
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:42,839
um realizing but but but look for that look for that when you're having compassion for

240
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:50,040
um or someone whether someone you know you care about or someone you don't know notice if

241
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:57,859
there is that that [Music] um that kinship that lack of separation

242
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:06,540
so I'll talk more about so so tomorrow we will explore the next category which is

243
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:11,820
very important category people we have challenges with and and I want and in

244
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:18,359
preparation for tomorrow I want to invite you if you can for the rest of the day to engage a little more with the

245
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:24,060
neutral person as you're walking as you're sitting as you're going around

246
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:29,099
um just maybe imagine you know you're sitting you're making yourself a cup of

247
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:36,540
tea imagine this neutral person making themselves a cup of tea and as you're enjoying your cup of tea imagine this

248
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:44,520
neutral person enjoying their cup of tea you're not so different or maybe you're both like green tea I wish you well I

249
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:51,000
wish you well um sister brother my Ken I wish you well so let's practice

250
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,839
with that um the rest of the day as a preparation really this is the stepping stone to

251
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:02,940
work with people we have challenges with and that's a very juicy and very

252
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:08,339
important category so important for us so so let's uh

253
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:13,560
yeah let's try to engage our hearts and their in expansion today so thank you so
