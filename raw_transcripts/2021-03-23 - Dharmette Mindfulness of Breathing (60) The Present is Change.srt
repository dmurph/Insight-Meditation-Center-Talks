1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,600
as i talked about yesterday

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,600
the fourth tetrad

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,240
the fourth and final group of four

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,519
practices or steps to

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,760
mindfulness of breathing

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,880
involve observing

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,359
and to settle back and observe our

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,279
experience

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,920
and part of a big part of the ability to

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,640
observe what's being implied here

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,440
is not to be assertive or not to be

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,800
doing things interpreting

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,000
changing fixing escaping

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,640
our experience but learning have the

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,800
stability

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,559
and the ease and the strength of

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,000
awareness

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,360
to settle back and just really see

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,719
clearly what is happening here

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,559
to observe clearly the moment

21
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,080
and and when we don't overlay

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,760
our ideas and our concepts what we see

23
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,880
is change we see things are much

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,880
are changing all the time and

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,119
it doesn't take a lot to appreciate i

26
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,320
think that

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,240
even aside from any ways in which we

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,640
think things are unchanging

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,840
that moment by moment there's always

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,240
change

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,560
that the day changes the lighting

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,280
changes slowly over time maybe

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,799
sometimes imperceptible if you're in a

34
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,960
city the sounds of the city are

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,200
constantly changing and um

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,920
the sensations of your body are changing

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,640
through the day

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,880
and you could watch the changes as we

39
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,680
get hungry

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,600
and we eat and we don't feel hungry we

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,520
feel uncomfortable we

42
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,280
we engage our body in different ways

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
different muscles are used at different

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,119
times and therefore different sensations

45
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,640
come into play

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,799
there's a constantly shifting changing

47
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,079
landscape

48
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,640
of where attention focuses and what it

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,159
takes in and

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,000
even things that don't necessarily

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,679
change themselves

52
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,879
what's changing constantly is how we're

53
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,319
perceiving it

54
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,879
how we see it if i look at the wall

55
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,879
that's opposite me here

56
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,840
that the natural thing when i'm relaxed

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,239
is to have my eyes kind of not fixate on

58
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,040
a spot

59
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,440
but just kind of roam around and even

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,280
though the wall is not changing

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,160
what's changing is the the uh where my

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,560
left my where my eyes land on or

63
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,040
the flowing of this of perception of the

64
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,000
wall

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,280
so whether it's something that's

66
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,400
constantly shifting like a river flowing

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,319
and we're watching it or whether or it's

68
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,879
the the act of perception is constantly

69
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,000
shifting and moving

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,800
and going around what we experience

71
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,200
is a constantly shifting landscape of

72
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,640
change

73
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,840
and it turns out that this is central

74
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,599
to the deeper insights of

75
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,560
buddhist meditation so in this in the

76
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,120
fourth

77
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,959
step of anapanasati the fourth tetrad

78
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,840
it begins when trains

79
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,760
experience observing in

80
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,040
in constancy i

81
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,519
breathe in

82
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,599
one trains ex

83
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,200
observing in constancy

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,080
i breathe out

85
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,200
and um so in constancy here is one of

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,000
the words for

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,519
change and

88
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,000
and things uh and so here is to see

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,159
really begin appreciating and seeing

90
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,080
the depth of how things are changing all

91
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,200
the time

92
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,439
and one of the reasons why buddhism puts

93
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,120
such a strong emphasis

94
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,840
on being present in having a present

95
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,599
moment attention

96
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,879
is that that's where change happens that

97
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,519
uh

98
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,680
if we're thinking about the past the

99
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,360
past in certain kind of way is not

100
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,480
changing anymore

101
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,519
except in how we remember it perhaps the

102
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,879
futures may be

103
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,720
it doesn't really exist to change it's

104
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
just kind of a projection of our

105
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,759
imagination

106
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,600
and and the

107
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
the um but in the present moments where

108
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,000
we see

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,919
the change it's kind of like where

110
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,000
that's where the river flows by of

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,759
change and all that and everything is

112
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,840
changing is according to the buddha

113
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,759
everything is inconstant and

114
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,759
this is not necessarily obvious in

115
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,199
ordinary consciousness and

116
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,880
ordinary ways of being but

117
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,080
but it's really central to what happens

118
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,240
in deeper and deeper meditation

119
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,520
in meditation itself where we're kind of

120
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,199
no longer paying attention to the wall

121
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,639
that's in the opposite side of the room

122
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,080
or a mountain and saying well the

123
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,600
mountain's not changing

124
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,199
and then we have to use our logic and

125
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,039
say well it's slowly being worn down and

126
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,199
eroding

127
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,280
but in meditation with the eyes closed

128
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,560
sitting here

129
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,639
that as we begin to

130
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,160
really open up to the present moment

131
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,919
experience and really feel it

132
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,919
sense it experience it observe it

133
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,080
what we experience in that kind of

134
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,680
context of meditation

135
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,560
is a constantly shifting of flow of

136
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,080
phenomenon

137
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,840
it's experienced after developing strong

138
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,160
stability

139
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,320
and part of the paradox is that

140
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,720
in meditation the more still the more

141
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
stable the mind is

142
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,520
the more the mind observes change and

143
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,039
impermanence

144
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,360
the more unstable the mind is the more

145
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,160
scattered and preoccupied the mind is

146
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,440
the more unsettled the more we tend to

147
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,120
impute permanence the more we tend to

148
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
get caught up in our ideas and thoughts

149
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,479
and stories

150
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,199
which have often carry with them a

151
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,639
feeling of things are

152
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,319
constant or permanent this is the way

153
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,080
things are

154
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,199
and and i've certainly have fallen into

155
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:17,919
the

156
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,919
delusion of permanence without

157
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,560
you know it being kind of unconsciously

158
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,319
even

159
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,639
and if i think about it of course i

160
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,360
don't believe what i'm feeling

161
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,919
but uh the way i'm acting sometimes

162
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,160
remember one day

163
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,000
many years ago having a difficult day

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,520
with my child

165
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,520
and and my wife and i were kind of like

166
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,880
hovering over him and

167
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,680
trying to manage with this highly

168
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,440
spirited child

169
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,800
and and then my wife just looked up at

170
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,840
me and said

171
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,039
we're having one of those kinds of days

172
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,039
and as soon as she said that then i

173
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,120
realized that i was kind of emotionally

174
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,319
operating as if

175
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,639
this is it we're always going to be this

176
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,479
way it's not going to change

177
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,400
of course i if i thought about it i

178
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,599
wouldn't

179
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,520
have been that way unknown that to

180
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,759
thought that but the emotional feeling

181
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,240
of it was a perm this is it and as soon

182
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,440
as you said that we're having one of

183
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,639
those kinds of days

184
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,720
then i relaxed and like you know okay

185
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,880
this is it's the manifestation of the

186
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
moment this is how it is now

187
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,319
and it will change it'll be we'll have a

188
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,120
different day tomorrow and something

189
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,560
so this imputing of permanence even

190
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,319
emotional feeling like this is it

191
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,520
interferes with our ability to step back

192
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,840
and benefit from the wisdom of change

193
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,199
and the wisdom of how things

194
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,400
move and constantly shifting and this is

195
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,759
one of the

196
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,879
key insights of the buddha

197
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,639
it doesn't say it this particular way

198
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,080
but this is

199
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,840
my interpretation that things are always

200
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,520
changing

201
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,360
and change is not random

202
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,080
change happens because of the conditions

203
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,199
that precede

204
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,840
what's happening now they can as

205
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,680
conditions shift and changes

206
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
the direction of change how things

207
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,160
change unfolds accordingly

208
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,440
that um that

209
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,199
generally we don't have rain without

210
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,080
clouds the clouds are the condition for

211
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,199
the changing weather of rain happening

212
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,280
and and so

213
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,518
when when i feel cold

214
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,320
then perhaps it's harder to get

215
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,518
sometimes harder for me to get

216
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,959
concentrated when i meditate i've

217
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,599
meditated sometimes in very cold weather

218
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,440
and i haven't really you know the

219
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,279
conditions were not there for me to get

220
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,440
settled and calm

221
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,360
there was still change happening and

222
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,640
things were being in all kinds of

223
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,959
different ways but it wasn't one that

224
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:55,760
supported

225
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,000
becoming concentrated and there are

226
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,120
times when the weather has been

227
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,680
comfortable or been bundled up nicely

228
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,959
and my body is not you know coping with

229
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,320
you know cold and shivering that

230
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,160
that i have different conditions of

231
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
being cozy and settled

232
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,560
and it's easier than to the conditions

233
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,360
are there

234
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,080
to allow the changing of into a

235
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,720
concentrated state of meditation

236
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,959
so depending on the conditions that are

237
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:23,920
present

238
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,640
change go and go in different directions

239
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,839
and the key one

240
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,920
that uh really central to the buddhist

241
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,200
teachings

242
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,560
is that things can go either

243
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,200
in a helpful direction or unhelpful

244
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,120
direction in a wholesome nourishing

245
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,240
direction or an

246
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,399
un helpful unnourishing direction

247
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,920
and the and so we're a little bit

248
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,000
responsible for putting the conditions

249
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,680
in place to support the directionality

250
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,360
of change we can't control it absolutely

251
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,600
we can't

252
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,240
make things be a certain way but we can

253
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,320
put the conditions in place to support a

254
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,040
tendency

255
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,240
in healthy directions beneficial ways

256
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,279
and and so

257
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,040
so a deep appreciation of change

258
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,360
shows us that also things are malleable

259
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,640
things are changeable

260
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,959
because they're always changing and we

261
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,360
have a little role to play

262
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,120
in the direction of that change if we're

263
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,839
floating in the river down a current in

264
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,720
the river

265
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,880
we understand that you know we're being

266
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,240
carried by the

267
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,360
flowing change of the river but we also

268
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,320
understand

269
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,519
that that which part of the current

270
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,200
we're in

271
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,160
how we avoid the eddies how we avoid the

272
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,680
parts of the current that takes us

273
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,480
up against the shore and we can gently

274
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,000
kind of guide ourselves

275
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,480
in that river in a way that keeps us in

276
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,160
the central current and we keep flowing

277
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,560
down the river

278
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,240
and um the um

279
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,279
um so

280
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,399
being attuned to change

281
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,839
is part of this uh uh

282
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,120
13th step of the sixteen steps of

283
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,040
mindfulness a twelve step

284
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,279
well thirteen for thirteen step of

285
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,959
mindfulness of breathing

286
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,640
and um the um

287
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,320
and it's to um observe

288
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
in the word is inconstancy and i'll talk

289
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,440
more about that tomorrow

290
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,640
but it's a part of this family of

291
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,279
concepts that relate to change things

292
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,880
becoming different

293
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,560
um and and

294
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,560
impermanence so

295
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,440
so to observe in constancy observe

296
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
change

297
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,240
and to find some degree of freedom

298
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,920
in the same kind of freedom that we

299
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,240
would have

300
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,560
if we're floating in the river there's a

301
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,279
freedom and being carried and

302
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,519
but then we're also careful about what

303
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,120
current we go in

304
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,800
how we're where we're floating the river

305
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,680
maybe even which river we're floating in

306
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,839
and so this might be the theme for this

307
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,240
next 24 hours for you

308
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,320
is to notice change

309
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,680
and notice how change arises

310
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,560
changes in ways depending on conditions

311
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,399
and how

312
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,040
and also how your role and where you

313
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,399
find yourself in your change your

314
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,160
relationship to change

315
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,920
and how you relate to that change

316
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,880
puts you on different currents if you're

317
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,720
resisting change or if you're fighting

318
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,639
change or if you're

319
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,639
attached to a change that puts you in a

320
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,680
different river

321
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,839
than one that is with change in an open

322
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,560
relaxed way

323
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,680
so um so there's different words

324
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,279
different concepts different ways of

325
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,519
kind of talking about the same thing the

326
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,519
buddha used different words

327
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,399
and now for now i'm using the word in

328
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,240
constancy and

329
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,040
and are focusing mostly on change and

330
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,839
tomorrow

331
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,720
we'll pick up this idea of inconstancy

332
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,279
more directly and

333
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,800
a word that is in polis

334
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,720
often or in english is often translated

335
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,320
as impermanence

336
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,000
but that we'll see tomorrow that in

337
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,920
constancy

338
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,040
might be a better translation

339
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,040
so so thank you all

340
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:47,920
very much and i look forward to tomorrow
