7
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:33,680
Begin almost undetectable cra C just the

8
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,680
slightest smile

9
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:17,360
and just let those uh Sensations Ripple through your face maybe more

10
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,360
broadly

11
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:57,080
this is not an attempt to blot out uh the suffering given to any life given to

12
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,319
this world

13
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,440
but uh to know some measure

14
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,040
of Joy uh can

15
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,040
coexist difficulty

16
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,760
our mind has a lot of difficulty with

17
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,519
ambiguity the mixed upness of Life

18
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:53,239
the experience of a ambivalence Ambi

19
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,200
valent different balances

20
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:11,480
naturally we uh kind of treat each moment as a problem to solve

21
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:21,199
and we can miss uh simple Delight of

22
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,800
a quarter

23
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
smile e

24
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,440
relax whatever can be

25
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:23,199
relaxed Grant permission for any tension that remains to remain

26
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:50,039
and find a place for your attention to rest that uh feels

27
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:58,159
soothing or even Pleasant subtly or obviously

28
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:26,720
one facet of equinity is letting go of the friction

29
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:34,039
with difficult experience but there's another aspect which is simply

30
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:39,460
allows uh difficulty or unpleasantness to be in the background while

31
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:46,759
[Music] we highlight the subtly

32
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,240
Pleasant just stay there for a minute or

33
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
two

34
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
e

35
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

36
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,479
e e

37
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,560
then uh just let

38
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,839
that Pleasant feeling mingle with your

39
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,720
breathing just like the breath catches

40
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,399
the the gust of

41
00:09:52,560 --> 00:10:01,320
pleasantness just breathe in a way that makes you really want to be

42
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,560
alive breathe in away where we

43
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,839
know each breath is

44
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Donna generosity offered to us to

45
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
enjoy

46
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

47
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

48
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

49
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

50
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,120
e e

51
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,680
maybe uh feels right just to stay practicing in this

52
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,759
way catching the the thread of pleasure and

53
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,800
breathing the oxygen hunger that's

54
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,680
satiated expelling what's been used up the relief

55
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:36,959
in that lot of pleasure in that

56
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:50,759
cycle maybe practice in such a way that

57
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:57,160
the anchor is not with our breathing but the anchor

58
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,040
is everywhere

59
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:29,519
that there is truly nothing outside the focus space the circle we draw around

60
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:37,839
the phenomena included contains everything

61
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:28,560
in a sense our suffering requires mindfulness to collapse

62
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:39,519
requires identification with some

63
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:45,519
uh afflictive phenomena

64
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:33,799
that which we're awake to never fully defines us is never the last

65
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:44,360
word so we stay wide awake to all the arising and passing

66
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:56,400
phenomena not trying to Cobble together a kind of vantage point a

67
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,840
lookout we just open

68
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,320
and Trust in

69
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
awareness

70
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

71
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

72
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

73
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,640
e e

74
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:30,080
even to make sense of my voice my meditation instructions

75
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,960
subtle kind of

76
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:54,120
identification maybe that's just fine maybe that's part of guided

77
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,960
meditations but the hunger to make

78
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:08,799
meaning is sometimes the charade of

79
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:23,919
Mara so maybe my voice and everything

80
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,520
else just become sound

81
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,520
you let go of my instructions in

82
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,520
order to practice

83
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
them

84
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

85
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

86
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

87
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

88
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

89
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

90
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

91
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

92
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

93
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

94
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
e

95
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
e e

96
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
e

97
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,880
okay what good to sit with

98
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:54,320
you so we'll we'll continue with uh this this theme of uh the Dharma Dharma of

99
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,919
other people um

100
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:08,120
so relationships um maybe we can say are kind of dance of

101
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:16,559
of assertion and surrender of holding power and sharing

102
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:22,039
power of accepting influence being affected being

103
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:29,440
porous enough to be affected how much how much surrender

104
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,480
does love demand uh not

105
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,679
everything but not nothing and how comfortable am

106
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:49,200
I uh surrendering My Views acquiescing to the other how comfortable am I how

107
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:56,360
native to my heart does it feel to accept influence and

108
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,720
alternatively how com am I expressing my needs

109
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:09,360
asserting uh something about my own heart some people kind of

110
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:17,120
feel okay only when they're holding on to power and others feel okay when

111
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:24,720
they're relinquishing power and it's a little bit like maybe

112
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:33,399
melting and freezing some only comfortable as water others

113
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:40,440
only comfortable as ice and we really need need flexibility

114
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:50,440
we need the ability to melt into the other but also to freeze and

115
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:57,200
individuate and maybe it seems like Dharma is all about melting melting melting melting actually Charlotte jobek

116
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:04,600
has a very beautiful description of being an ice cube and melting and once you get a little mushy you can't get UNM

117
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:11,440
mushy you know it's very beautiful this is a little different sense of

118
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:18,480
um yeah of of freezing as a way of um of

119
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,960
of individuating so I sometimes have have

120
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,720
mentioned this uh exercise I did as a yogi was was was sitting the retreat at

121
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:41,000
IRC uh 6 years ago with Ain suito and uh aan uh in his capacity as

122
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,760
for a long time as an Abbot and as an elder within the the monastic system

123
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:54,080
high Forest lineage uh he said very explicitly that he found meditation practices

124
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:01,000
were insufficient for uh managing the interpersonal

125
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,919
Dynamics within communities and found that some explicit interpersonal

126
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,240
practices were important in uh fostering

127
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:19,320
communal Harmony and so he shared some of those

128
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:27,040
practices uh with us in that in that week and for one of them we gathered if

129
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,878
you've been to to Insight Retreat Center uh uh we gathered in the community room

130
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,000
that not the meditation Hall the big open room those very high ceilings and

131
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,560
the light flooding in and um and it was a group of about 40 and the instruction

132
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:56,800
was to pair now we've been sitting for I don't know five days of silence and um to pair up stand maybe 10

133
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:05,040
15 ft part from your partner lined up in rows you know one row here one row there

134
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:13,480
facing each other and the goal is to explore connection and boundaries and

135
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:20,920
intimacy and the instruction was to walk towards each other

136
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:27,839
um walk walk walk towards each other and you can either signal stop

137
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,160
move move forward or slow down you know and the

138
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:40,800
idea was like okay how how much can we negotiate our own

139
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:48,560
inner life while remaining deeply connected to another person you're feeling into like where

140
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,079
you can be safely connected not relinquish

141
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:03,960
yourself where you the moment moments where you actually need to U freeze rather than melt and then

142
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:13,240
melt again and I was in uh I I don't remember

143
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:19,200
exactly but I was in a weird you know altered state kind of just it was enough

144
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,359
sitting and beautiful Dharma that it was like

145
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:29,800
um it had made an impact it was very I was kind of like very very thinned out

146
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:36,800
and very loving very melt very much on the melty side you know and

147
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,079
um and the practice kind of starts immediately like okay pick a partner and

148
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:49,920
I even though I talk to large groups of people regularly and feel unashamed to do so

149
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,880
I'm actually shy and live to avoid certain species of social awkwardness

150
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,560
like it's my reason for living is just to avoid certain species of

151
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:11,040
awkwardness but I got to find a partner right and I'm just there as a yogi but

152
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,000
some people there knew that I taught there and that adds a layer of

153
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:24,760
complexity you know and I remember like okay I'm in this like very melty kind of

154
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:32,480
state I I don't want to go kind of like slobber on some poor Yogi like I'm this

155
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:39,560
big dumb meta dog you know like I was just like all right I'm just going to let somebody come to me you know I just

156
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:45,560
stood there a little Frozen waiting for someone to

157
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:51,079
approach and then we see how does it feel to be in their presence I knew I

158
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:56,359
knew the person I knew knew I remember warm you know we didn't know each other

159
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:05,800
well but I remember very warm feelings towards him and okay how how close can one get

160
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:11,920
while staying connected to yourself what does it mean to be deeply porous but not

161
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,359
abandon yourself and so this is a kind of dance

162
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:26,440
of feeling into one's needs sensing one's boundaries sensing when to melt when to freeze

163
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,240
sensing when you can no longer take that person

164
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:39,280
in and so we're seeing them but we're also seeing our own mind you know we try

165
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,920
to to attune to them but we're they also function as a kind of screen on which

166
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:51,640
our mind is projected and the Gaze of another especially in the context of all the

167
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:57,760
silence it's like the Gaze of the others is evocative right we we some sometimes

168
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:05,880
that can really freeze us into a sense of self and that form of freezing is a kind

169
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,119
of static that interrupts intimacy

170
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:20,480
often what is it what does it feel like to feel that they see

171
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:29,280
me that sense of like I'm being seen I'm an object in the mind of the other

172
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,960
and we sense what it might what we kind of model what it might be like in their mind to see

173
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:43,760
me and there's a kind of subtle or maybe sometimes dramatic pain of duality in

174
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:53,240
that of an object being seen by another an animal being viewed by another

175
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,079
animal and to even feel like your behind

176
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:02,400
your eyes is a

177
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:14,079
liability the face is so potent it doesn't in in seeing in being seen it

178
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:20,319
does not have to conclude with self we melt we melt and in that melting we

179
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:27,839
start to sense the a whole kind of Ethics in the face of the other

180
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:34,319
you look really carefully at somebody's face in their

181
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:42,880
undefended just relaxation you look carefully at that face a whole ethics in

182
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:50,960
it and so okay we start walking uh you know walking towards each

183
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:58,680
other and it feels so good you know there like

184
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:06,520
how how open can things be how vast can they be just open you're kind of like as

185
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,800
I remember it just like pervasively open

186
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:19,119
space mingled with meta you know and the field was so bright it was

187
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:26,960
a bright room but it was the kind of like Luminosity of the mind and everything just so run through

188
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:34,920
with space and we start to open in this way

189
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:45,520
and the perception of the other person occurs in the same field as all self

190
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:53,839
referentiality self and other arising in the same

191
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,240
field and where am I then

192
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:07,160
the sense of like having melted behind my clo eye you know Frozen behind my

193
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:12,480
closed eyes located back there that

194
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:20,160
fully fully dissolves and so this is a kind of state

195
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:28,000
of like very deeply forgetting oneself who you are how you're seen

196
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,160
what's right or wrong about you every every self

197
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:42,200
story is a kind of Million Miles Away and utterly irrelevant to the project of

198
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,880
living and almost everything falls away except a sense of

199
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:53,440
knowing you know and the knowing is very

200
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:02,839
satiating very un un partitioned space unpartitioned epistemic space is

201
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:07,920
the way philosopher metzinger characterized

202
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:16,359
it and so there's all this melting and then what actually happened

203
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:23,680
was like self view gripped my mind there was a certain kind of freezing that

204
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:30,160
happened that I didn't notice and and I had the thought like you know I'm a

205
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,559
sensitive New Age guy I should get really close to this

206
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:41,119
person but I could feel I was

207
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,640
like something was starting to I was like

208
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:51,960
betraying something I was like like sacrificing my

209
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,280
boundaries because I had some ideal of what I was supposed to be and in

210
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,359
instantaneously like the vast open meta field just

211
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:07,599
dissolved dissolved

212
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:13,079
and a very kind of in a sense very um

213
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:18,680
dramatic form of freezing that didn't have to happen if I actually could have

214
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:27,640
just Frozen in a more relaxed way right as I'm sensing like oh okay so

215
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,680
now this feels like too much or something's in intrusive about the

216
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:39,839
presence of the other and I needed to say okay let us pause and I

217
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:45,680
couldn't and then that is what led to this kind of like the other end of the

218
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:53,480
spectrum a really deep freeze and so I was you could say identified with

219
00:44:53,480 --> 00:45:00,920
being like water I couldn't be ice but then and I strangely created the

220
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:06,319
experience of really freezing that inflexibility that

221
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:12,960
identification with being water uh became a

222
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:20,359
problem some of us need more practice being like water some being like

223
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:26,559
ice and we probably all need more practice in the transition of moving

224
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:33,520
between water and ice the dance of yes and

225
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:40,040
no dance of yes and no if you you don't trust somebody's yes

226
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:45,520
you you know uh it's hard to know what their no

227
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:55,920
means if they can't say no hard to know what a Yes means the dance of yes and no assertion

228
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,920
surrender water ice okay offer this for your

229
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:10,200
consideration and um uh I I some of you know but I do a

230
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:16,520
