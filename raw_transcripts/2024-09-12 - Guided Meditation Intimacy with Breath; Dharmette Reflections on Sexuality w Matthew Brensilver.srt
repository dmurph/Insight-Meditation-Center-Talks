1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,720
okay folks uh so welcome yeah nice seeing

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:16,198
names so um yeah let's uh let's let's practice

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:24,800
together um I sort of want to take requests what what to what we sit on but

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,279
uh I'll find my way all right let's uh met

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
in okay

6
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,439
that familiar breath that's

7
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,880
also so fresh

8
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:47,759
the visual imagery of breathing is often prominent we're feeling our breath but

9
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:57,119
the subtle visual images even with our eyes closed are like guiding the attention to

10
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,880
the sensations of breathing e

11
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,560
and what if we were surprised that at the end of the in

12
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,360
breath an out breath followed rather than somehow

13
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,080
miraculously another in breath

14
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:17,440
how do we give ourselves to thinner and thinner slices of

15
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,760
time e

16
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,560
sense of uh intimacy with

17
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:22,079
the constellation of Sensations that compose our

18
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
breathing

19
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
for

20
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
e

21
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,639
e e

22
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,960
we just let our our breathing awaken the senses

23
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,120
this memory of uh you know putting too

24
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:13,599
much kind of uh spicy mustard on a spring roll and just blows out

25
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,479
the nasal cavity or something just wide

26
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:27,360
open that's kind of how the breath can be just for all the

27
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,520
senses even if you're tired

28
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,120
even if it's the end of a long

29
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,479
day e

30
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:41,159
we elevate a peace above all

31
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:50,000
else sometimes we abide in peace sometimes we're making

32
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:05,160
peace making peace with the Loose Ends of the the day or the

33
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,519
life just don't be seduced

34
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,680
by fake

35
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Refuge

36
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

37
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

38
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

39
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

40
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

41
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

42
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

43
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,120
e e

44
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,880
we forgive our minds for all the

45
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:28,040
patrolling that they do and all the foraging

46
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,839
foraging in the realm of

47
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,680
thoughts we reconnect with this moment with Dharma

48
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,320
let the breath breathe life

49
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,120
into our attention

50
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,920
just make your home in your breath

51
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,920
it's very soothing when our world of experience

52
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,560
gets simple and small

53
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,639
very SM soothing when uh all

54
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:44,560
the arrows in our being start to line up in One

55
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Direction and just to be alive is enough just to breathe

56
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,839
together it's enough

57
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

58
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

59
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

60
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

61
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
e e

62
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:07,520
if there's something uh especially sticky in the hard

63
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,159
mind something that uh repeatedly

64
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:18,880
pulls your attention

65
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,240
maybe good to move into the felt experience of

66
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:32,480
that stickiness the sense of emot activation in our

67
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,280
body that makes something feel urgent or

68
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,159
draws our obsessional Tendencies

69
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:56,559
out and maybe we linger with that effective emotional

70
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,960
arousal until it settles a

71
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:22,799
bit and then maybe it feels inviting to come back to the

72
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:30,520
rhythm of breathing

73
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

74
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

75
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

76
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

77
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

78
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

79
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

80
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

81
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

82
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

83
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

84
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

85
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
e e

86
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,080
e

87
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,320
okay so it's uh it's good to say with

88
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:47,640
you so I thought to to just uh carry on with the theme that uh been developing

89
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:54,960
at uh the morning morning set skills sets and uh that's if you haven't been

90
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:03,320
um Dharma and interpersonal life and um I thought to say something about

91
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,559
uh the theme of sexuality and a neglected Dharma topic

92
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:15,840
and as I was putting together kind of thoughts about this it struck me as

93
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,279
like are the Buddhists going to make this depressing too and by the Buddhist

94
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:29,600
I mean me and even sex depressing a little bit

95
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:36,960
maybe maybe a little bit a complicated issue and uh I speak about it knowing

96
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,000
just um the range of experiences and

97
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,159
meaning and beauty and harm and um all of that what's

98
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:54,720
empowering for one person is very much not that for another it's

99
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:03,080
um so it's an important caveat on all of this this but uh felt like okay I can say

100
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:09,559
something about this so to

101
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:18,039
love to love is to risk and to desire is sometimes to feel

102
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:25,440
destabilized and I I read somewhere I don't know where don't remember but it said it was

103
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,159
some psychoanalytic writer and they said something like for Freud God was merely

104
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:39,279
a way of gratifying sexual desire for young

105
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:46,840
sexuality was a way of expressing a longing for God for the

106
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,200
sacred and I think they're both kind of

107
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,240
right so this is a Zone where

108
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,880
lay life which may or may not but may include sexual relationships it really

109
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:10,120
must chart its own course and it's not easy to translate

110
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:15,960
the monastic teachings to this realm and there are some basic

111
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:22,080
principles of course that are incredibly important harmlessness being obvious but

112
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,760
how to actually enrich and refine SE sexual life that's uh that's

113
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:35,320
an open question and I have genuine Sympathy for

114
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:41,399
the impulse to say it's too much it's too complicated sexual desire acts like

115
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:48,279
a magnet that pulls too many other corrosive forces to the surface

116
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:53,840
that are painful and even even sex itself which

117
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,120
might be wonderful sexual desire Moment by moment generally

118
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:06,760
speaking is not Pleasant now monastic many years ago

119
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:13,200
heard I I heard um say something like characterizing the blessings of the

120
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:20,120
monastic life referred to celibacy uh the peacefulness of

121
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:29,159
celibacy and we might say many things about sex but peaceful would not be one

122
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:36,919
them Leonard um Leonard Cohen um in the last album of his life

123
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:42,880
singing really about his death uh said uh you don't need a lawyer

124
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:50,440
I'm not making a claim you don't need to surrender I'm not taking aim I don't

125
00:33:50,440 --> 00:34:00,120
need a lover no no no The Wretched Beast is tame I don't need a lover so blow out

126
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:08,240
the flame The Wretched Beast is tame and

127
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:15,599
then there's a kind of opening openness to death and how do we think about that is

128
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,480
that something to celebrate Joseph Goldstein told this

129
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:29,158
famous story of upand you know the burm Monk and beloved teacher

130
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:36,800
um was talking about uh sense desire sense craving goes on for 10 minutes in

131
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,960
Burmese and then the translator renders the last 10 minutes with uh four words

132
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:50,000
lust cracks the brain lust cracks the

133
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,960
brain and I agree with that wholeheartedly

134
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:03,119
but I don't think that's the only thing lust

135
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:10,200
does so yes one one must consciously consent to some measure of of suffering

136
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,240
in this realm like a Dua free path is a

137
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,920
fantasy is a a really fantastic uh short

138
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:29,000
story from liia Davis a story after um after a a brief very intense love affair

139
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,400
the narrator trying to decide if it was quote worth it worth it so he's pricing

140
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,320
everything out everything he loved about her the ecstatic description of passion

141
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,640
and tenderness and care and then it ends and the

142
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:53,839
breakup and uh Davis writes this this character the narrator I I guess you get

143
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:00,359
to a point where you look at that pain as if it were there in front of you 3 ft

144
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:05,480
away lying in a box an open box in a window

145
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:14,240
somewhere it's hard and cold like a bar of metal you just look at it there and say

146
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:21,119
all right I'll take it I'll buy it that's what it is because you know

147
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,599
all about it before you even go into this thing you know the pain is part of

148
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:33,119
the whole thing and it isn't that you can say afterwards the pleasure was greater than the pain

149
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:40,800
and that's why you would do it again that has nothing to do with it you can't measure it because the pain comes after

150
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,079
and it lasts longer so the question really is why doesn't that pain make you

151
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:54,920
say I won't do it again when the pain is so bad that you have to say that but you

152
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,920
don't

153
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:08,440
but we don't and so here we are and can we make the best go of

154
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:14,960
it and so what what forms of well-being on offer even if we know not that of

155
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:22,000
course celibacy guarantees its own species of suffering can we consent to the

156
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,720
suffering involved in this whole realm and then look look what are the

157
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:37,040
possibilities what what kind of forms of well-being are on offer here what forms

158
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,319
of spiritual growth are on offer there are whole Traditions about that that I

159
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:50,160
don't really know a different scene in the inside world but what are the what are the

160
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,960
possibilities of applying attention to emotional and physical

161
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:03,720
intimacy attention that kind of most basic

162
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:11,440
currency of a human life we we know the power of attention when applied to our

163
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:19,960
breathing or an emotion or meta right we know the power of that

164
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:26,119
that you do that a certain kind of fidelity just to the

165
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,240
breathing and and a lot can

166
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,800
happen what can happen with attention applied in the

167
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:46,359
realm of of sexual connection what uh can a kind of trained

168
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:54,839
open attention do in the context of intimacy how um how intuitive and

169
00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:01,680
embodied and undefended might one be become you know like how completely

170
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:07,599
might the self melt in this

171
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:16,000
realm I was talking to a a Dharma friend about this and they wondered like would

172
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,640
as a kind of parallel would a deeply enlightened person feel

173
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:28,359
grief and they concluded their conjecture was really like yeah

174
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:35,200
but there would be a freedom in it and that feels right to

175
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,359
me and then they ask like might that also be the case with sexual desire is

176
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:47,119
that inherently like bondage of some sort or

177
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,160
is it possible to be to experience that in a very free

178
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,200
way is it possible to be free and EXP experience

179
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:05,200
redeem really redeem desire from the clutches of

180
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:15,119
compulsivity jezelle Jones um couple therapist and mindfulness person friend

181
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:22,319
um she said defined intimacy as the the the the willingness and ability to see

182
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:31,119
and be seen the willingness and the ability to see and be seen and in this realm uh

183
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:37,640
where we're seeing and being seen in a very deep way you

184
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:46,160
know and the question maybe is like how unashamed might one

185
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:54,319
become how unencumbered by a certain kind of self-consciousness might one become how

186
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:00,920
unencumbered by ideas that create kind of

187
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,599
static when one asks the question what do I

188
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:11,079
want how unencumbered might we

189
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:21,040
be sexuality is um you know we do things together right

190
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:27,400
but sexuality may be like the deepest way of doing something together maybe

191
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:34,520
raising a child is like that I don't know but of doing doing something

192
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:41,400
together of coordinating desire and need and

193
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:49,800
generosity and this is a Zone where the more Supple we get with our roles the

194
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:57,000
more fluid we can be around power yielding or asserting the yes and no

195
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,880
that I spoke about this morning the more Supple we can be in that uh the more

196
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:11,640
fluidity there is in the whole realm the

197
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:20,280
um in other words the sense sense of self um must be flexible to be for us to

198
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,280
be truly available for delight and

199
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:33,720
connection and there are uh this is also the realm of um where there there can be

200
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:42,400
a very kind of deep relief from the confines of Duality that is on offer

201
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:50,000
here where where do I end and they begin you know what what like what what is

202
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:57,640
what is my desire or Horrors you know it's it gets very Marky

203
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:04,839
and that sense of being uh confined confined behind one's eyes comes more

204
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:13,160
and more porous naturally um spiritual approaches

205
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:19,000
to sexuality tend to emphasize the tenderness and the love and the warmth

206
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:27,640
and the the nonu non-duality or something like this but uh it's also

207
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:32,680
a realm of other other kinds of energies it's a realm

208
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:42,640
where sometimes very usefully anger is diffused or forgiveness offered or nots

209
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:51,520
untangled somehow better than the words might ever do you know I'm sorry but how do we say

210
00:43:51,520 --> 00:44:00,440
that with our bodies and so in this realm uh

211
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:06,040
we we must learn to tolerate some measure of

212
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:12,520
disorientation um disorientation we're playing with very potent forces that's

213
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:20,640
why the precepts you know around sexual misconduct and harm and all of that so

214
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,440
important this is why um yeah we must be careful with it

215
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:33,680
because the this Sexual Energy can be like a magnet that draws lots of other

216
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,960
forces to the surface so this is um uh

217
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:46,920
again the analyst Stephen Mitchell um from uh book can can love last I

218
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:54,920
think uh the fate of romance over time Mitchell writes um erotic passion

219
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:00,599
destabilizes one's sense of self when we find someone intensely arousing

220
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:06,599
who makes possible unfamiliar experiences of ourselves and an

221
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:12,319
otherness we find captivating we're drawn into

222
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:18,079
disorientation we tend to want to control these experiences and the others

223
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:24,800
who Inspire them sustaining romance requires a struggle to resist the

224
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:33,440
inevitable efforts to draw moving but unsettling experiences under our

225
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,640
control our journey in the otherness of the

226
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:46,960
other often surprises us with unknown features of

227
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:58,920
ourselves so wisdom love

228
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,960
maybe sometimes it's just as simple as pleasure but it also can be

229
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:11,520
wisdom and love soer this for your

230
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:18,079
consideration and uh please pick up whatever is useful and uh leave the rest

231
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:23,480
behind okay folks thank you
