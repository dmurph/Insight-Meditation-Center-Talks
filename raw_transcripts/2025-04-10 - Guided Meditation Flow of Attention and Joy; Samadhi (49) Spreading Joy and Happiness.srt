1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:08,720
so good morning everyone and I hope you hear me okay with

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:15,960
the microphone on my laptop so here I am at Spirit Rock these

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,960
wonderful rolling grasslands oak grasslands that uh the retreat center in

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,519
Marin County California i'm here teaching a retreat with about a hundred

5
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:34,800
people with a few wonderful teachers that um my

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:44,440
friends [Music] so welcome to our meditation session

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,680
and maybe you hear the birds and we'll

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:57,680
see sometimes when I'm here um animals will walk by yesterday there was a a big

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,640
healthy looking beautiful looking coyote uh up here walking up by in the

10
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:14,240
hills so um I'll offer you an a kind of similly

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:22,000
analogy in our uh in my yard garden at home we

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,759
have a um outdoor faucet used for watering the garden and the faucet has a

13
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,360
extension to it that is the shape of a Y so that we can attach two

14
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:43,439
hoses to the same faucet and then the Y has a valve and

15
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:50,000
you can move the valve back and forth between um one or the two arms of the Y

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,840
depending which hose you want to have water in or you can also put it in the middle

17
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:04,159
position and it goes some water goes into both hoses so in the same way uh we're and so

18
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,399
whatever part of the garden we want to water uh we turn the valve one way or the

19
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:16,200
other so in the same way for our meditation uh we have something that's

20
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,879
waterlike and it is um ordinarily I think of it as awareness our

21
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:32,640
attention and the um and in in the Janna uh it's the

22
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,800
meditative joy and happiness that comes from the practice but it begins with awareness

23
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,040
that awareness attention is a kind of a a water that

24
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,319
waters that feeds that nourishes whatever it flows into so if you're

25
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:59,519
watering worry worry grows if you're watering

26
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,480
um desires desires grow if you're watering resentment resentment grows it

27
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,840
matters where your attention goes where your focus goes where your involvement mental involvement

28
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:20,560
goes and it helps if we can turn that valve inside so this wonderful resource

29
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:28,319
that we have attention awareness can flow to flow and water feed nourish

30
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,480
something that's really wholesome and good and the ancient tradition in

31
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,159
Buddhism is to you do that with meditation mindfulness of

32
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:45,799
breathing and um and so there's a kind of a non-thinking

33
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:51,000
awareness that uh we pour into uh the

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,120
body settle into the body to and we water with awareness the

35
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,640
goodness of uh of just simply

36
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,480
breathing and as we breathe there's a second

37
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,799
nourishment and that is uh as we get uh

38
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,160
uh absorbed engaged fully giving ourselves over to

39
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,919
uh to the simplicity of breathing then there starts to be the

40
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:36,680
nourishment of well-being a joy happiness

41
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:44,800
delight that comes from the absorption that comes from the full engagement in

42
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,199
what we're doing and of course it's a little bit more difficult to do it with something as simple as breathing than it

43
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:58,080
is to do it with a really good book we're reading or great craft we're doing or sport we're playing but that's the

44
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,800
art and the practice we're doing here is to find that way to take the healthy

45
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,800
nourishment the healthy take awareness and our well-being and let it flow into

46
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:18,759
our body into the practice to be fully here so to assume a meditation

47
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:28,080
posture and for today you might want to emphasize a posture that is uh has no as

48
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,600
little discomfort in it as possible so if you normally sit with

49
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:41,360
knee pain or back pain uh maybe for today assume a posture that um that

50
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,360
lessens that as much as possible

51
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,120
and then gently close your

52
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:12,440
eyes and to take a few long slow deep breaths

53
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,039
beginning to turn the flow of awareness into the

54
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:27,720
body out of thinking where many people spend much of the day

55
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:52,360
letting the breathing return to normal

56
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,520
and investigate the body breathing

57
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:05,400
investigate how breathing is occurring in your body at this moment

58
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,720
what moves in your

59
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:24,400
body what sensations come into play as you

60
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,400
breathe

61
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,280
what is the nature the quality of your breathing is

62
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:48,400
it forceful is it easeful is it slow or

63
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,879
fast is it shallow or deep

64
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,960
whatever it is just notice it note it how it is for you

65
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:21,720
and then as you breathe pause at the end of the

66
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:28,000
exhale for a comfortable length of time however brief that

67
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:37,039
is so that you have more valuing more

68
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,399
appreciation of breathing in

69
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,839
the same with the top of the exhale inhale a slight pause so there's a

70
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:04,279
growing appreciation of how important and valuable it is to breathe

71
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,240
as you exhale softening your

72
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,800
body relaxing sing

73
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:09,079
as you exhale relax your thinking mind

74
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,639
soften in the mind that

75
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:27,279
thinks a soft softening that lessens the strong pull

76
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:36,480
or the strong inclination to think it's okay for a little

77
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:42,600
while to let thinking recede to the background

78
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:54,720
and turning your attention now so the the nourishment the food the

79
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:03,480
water of awareness flows into your body breathing

80

89
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,560

90
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:58,320
calm clarity a feeling of

91
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:09,839
wholeness and into that calm body flows awareness attention

92
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,040
the kind of awareness that has minimal thought in

93
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:24,959

94
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,760

pleasure that comes from being engaged in the

99
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:14,360
meditation that comes from not getting lost in

100
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,480
thought but rather being dipping

101
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:26,720
in flowing into this broad

102
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,720
lake of the

103
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,520
body with an inner

104
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:45,440
wellspring of maybe subtle wellbeing joy and

00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:24,600
body to flow to open up and to

110
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,480
spread with every

111
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:39,799
breath whatever wellbeing there is spreads through the body

112
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,600
and supports the mind to become quiet

113
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,919
clear without being crowded with

114
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:07,880
thinking the clear space has more room for wellbeing

115
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,240
that for these minutes is being

116
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:24,919
prioritized as if it's a kind of nourishment for you

117
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,240

120
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:27,080
breath giving more room for well-being to

121
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:33,320
flow coziness sweetness to flow through your

122
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:42,039
body spreading into the arms the legs

123
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:35,720
There can be a feedback loop or

124
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:42,559
quiet soft attention to joy and

125
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,640
happiness supports the joy and happiness to grow which in return supports the

126
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:58,158
interest to stay there with it to breathe with

127
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,919
it slowly gently the absorption in the meditation

128
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:12,440
the absorption in the pleasure and the pleasure of the joy and

129
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,840
happiness grow together

130
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,880
then as we come to the end of this sitting

131
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:19,200
to let the boundaries of your body your joy your

132
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:28,320
well-being flow beyond your body or let the joy and the happiness flow

133
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,440
beyond any sense of boundaries to self like the

134
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:43,080
breath the air comes into your body and leaves and spreads out into the world

135
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:51,320
so let your joy your happiness whenever you have

136
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:59,279
it not be something you hold on to for yourself but something that is the

137
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:06,360
condition the cause for you to be friendly to

138
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:13,559
others that you meet people carrying your joy your

139
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:23,519
well-being that is the medium through which you see people through which you speak with

140
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:30,000
people those times when you feel happiness let it be something that

141
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,600
spreads into the world may it be

142
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,320
that this practice we're doing together causes each of

143
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:50,960
us to improve the lives of people around us today with small acts of kindness small

144
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:58,000
acts of joy of appreciation respect may it be that this meditation we do

145
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,520
serves the world so that all beings may be

146
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:12,200

153
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:34,880
Janna and um some people call Janna just call it Janna some people call it

154
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,120
absorptions some people call it immer immersions um some people have in the

155
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:47,760
past many years ago they used to call it transes when they didn't quite know what it what it was

156
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,960
and um uh there states of wholeness

157
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:02,080
uh of unification where we're not divided from with it with with ourselves we're not uh

158
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,159
uh distracted or um our attention is not um

159
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:14,080
uh pulled in different directions and it's a pleasure to come

160
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:21,720
together and have all of us here all of ourselves uh engaged in the same thing at the same

161
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:30,080
time and to really get into it to really be absorbed in it and give ourselves over to it there's a joy that comes i

162
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:36,559
think human beings and I think animals too can have there's a there's a joy of

163
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:43,080
certain kind of certain types of completely giving ourselves over to something that's really enjoyable and

164
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:51,200
pleasant and there's a kind of more than just pleasure there's a kind of happiness and delight and thrill and of

165
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:58,519
kind of giving ourselves over to it or losing our not losing ourselves but kind of fully giving ourselves over to

166
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:04,080
something and I think I told the story sometime recently but that um many years

167
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,159
ago I came out of uh out onto the street was raining and um and there was a car

168
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,279
across the street uh where there was a little bird that was sliding down the

169
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,399
windshield of the car the wet windshield in the rain and then flying up to the

170
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:26,360
top of the windshield and and sliding down again over and over again around and

171
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,320
around and um I could only think that this uh bird was enjoying itself was

172
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:39,360
absorbed in the delight of sliding so to give ourselves over maybe a little

173
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,960
bit like uh the delight of children uh fully giving themselves over to some

174
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,640
activity that's so much fun so the quality of the second Janna

175
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:58,080
uh has to do with uh coming into a form of full absorption full engagement in

176
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:05,240
what we're doing without any stress when there's a a a vast calm

177
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:12,559
settleness stability uh when there's a vast clarity

178
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,559
uh some people call it clarity and um some people I was going

179
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,840
to say use the word assurance for the poly word the ancient Buddhist word so

180
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:32,240
to sit with tremendous sense of assurance of of confidence or or

181
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,360
safety or this is really a good good way to

182
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,880
be and um and a unification of all of us

183
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:49,519
involved and then the art of this is to begin appreciating the joy and the

184
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,679
happiness that's there the some people call it um even rapture because it can

185
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,080
be quite strong and some people call it bliss rapture and bliss because of the

186
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,358
it's qualitatively so much greater sometimes than ordinary happiness and

187
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:15,760
joy and um and to adhere a situation you ought to give yourself over to it you're

188
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:24,480
allowed to make room for it and feel it and enjoy it and there's an art in in in

189
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,960
deep meditation to begin not holding on to the joy not that being attached to it

190
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:38,158
but to um make room for it to uh with the breathing perhaps massaging it more

191
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:44,878
or allowing it to flow and mostly in the second Janna I think of it of this as as

192
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:52,240
um just making more room uh letting it flow uh feeling the

193
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:59,200
current of it feeling the hum feeling the the flow of these uh good feelings

194
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,200
that can be there and not making a lot of them not getting excited uh staying

195
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,040
with the calm but with the calm and the clarity just allowing them to live

196
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:19,400
allowing them to flow that this is where the the the food of awareness this is what

197
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:28,040
attention uh supports the growing of the growing of joy the growing of of

198
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:36,400
happiness and the classic instructions are to let it pervade suse permeate

199
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,720
spread throughout the body and um so sometimes it's actually kind of nice to

200
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,119
kind of feel like you're kind of blowing it or or supporting it to flow into the

201
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,320
arms and the hands and into the legs um into the full

202
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:01,920
torso um and at times when there doesn't seem to be any boundaries to the body to

203
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:10,320
just feel like it just just it's just just kind of radiating in all directions front and back and everything

204
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:21,200
and um so I know that this kind of joy I'm talking about is uh far from or our

205
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,400
ordinary experience and there's a lot of challenges that we have in our lives and

206
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,680
challenges with our external lives challenges with our own minds and hearts

207
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:38,880
and uh it can be a little bit uh grading or discouraging to hear these descriptions of this kind that pervasive

208
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,160
joy and happiness um so it's uh but it's also

209
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:51,359
can be inspiring that this is possible for a human being we can put aside the

210
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:59,880
all the all our ordinary concerns and get refreshed get renewed get

211
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:07,119
settled so that eventually we can do a deeper work um of really of insight

212
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:13,200
deeper work of really seeing clearly to the depths of our hearts uh where

213
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:19,440
suffering is and where freedom is um and that's the overall purpose for this joy

214
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:26,880
and happiness it's not just for this meditative joy and happiness for his own sake and some people get a little bit

215
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:34,240
side or quite sidetracked by it by just getting addicted to it and just want to have this over and over again but it's a

216
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,440
it's important to see it as a stepping stone to eventually having very deep

217
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,599
insight there's a purification there's a clarification that goes on with this

218
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,880
there's a healing that goes on by allowing ourselves to feel this kind of joy and

219
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,440
happiness and uh it's good to take take if one drops into these kind of Janna

220
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:03,119
states it's good to take one's time with it uh ordinarily people will often get

221
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:10,079
quite excited by these wonderful states and then they pop right out they start thinking how wonderful it is and they

222
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,000
get distracted almost by their excitement but the idea is to become familiar with

223
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:24,000
them don't be in a hurry to go through them don't be in a hurry to strengthen them but gently get to know them feel

224
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,640
them become familiar with them um and uh and let the joy and the happiness um

225
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:38,400
nourish you support you guide you uh feel it well this is a time in life in

226
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,440
these states when they when this joy and happiness is there you have complete

227
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,680
permission in meditation to experience up to the point of ecstasy to experience

228
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:55,280
the joy the happiness and um and maybe even uh you

229
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:01,839
can you can support that process by making a half smile and or you could

230
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:07,040
maybe feel that the joy and the happiness wants a half smile And you can

231
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:15,040
smile with the practice as you do it and then uh if you go into these kind

232
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:23,400
of deeper states of well-being then um uh you can

233
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,599
um it's valuable to come out of these meditations slowly uh don't be try not

234
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:37,040
to be in a situation where you have to pop out and get to work or do something quickly but come out slowly and so you

235
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,079
stay closely connected as if you're allowing something to still work you

236
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,440
allowing you're receiving the goodness of it the blessings of it somehow or the

237
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:53,359
the you're you're reconditioning yourself in a deep way and maybe get up

238
00:39:53,359 --> 00:40:00,320
and start doing simple things in the morning maybe you can get up and make breakfast in a simple relaxed way that

239
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:07,440
kind of goes along with the general tenor the general feeling of how it felt

240
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:14,400
in the meditation and um and if you don't feel

241
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,640
this kind of deep happiness and joy uh that's fine mostly meditators don't feel

242
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:27,280
it um but from time to time they come and I'm hoping that uh you'll have a

243
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,400
greater appreciation and readiness to practice with it uh through these

244
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,000
teachings here so thank you very much and um I'll

245
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,359
be here tomorrow again at Spirit Rock and next week the first three days so

246
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:50,400

247
