3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:22,880
meditation uh today on holding peace holding peace in our hearts in our

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:31,240
minds um holding peace both for the sake of ourselves um as we connect and relate

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,200
to ourselves with with peace with

6
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,760
balance and also to hold peace for our

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,719
inter for for our relational space as we relate to others especially if there's

8
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:57,840
any friction uh in any interactions we have with others holding peace holding

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,119
spaciousness and also so as we relate to the news of the world as we relate to

10
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,479
the world to um to hold peace to hold

11
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:20,320
peace as we think of others whether they are in a space of um

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,759
being um if they're in a space of suffering whether the the perpetrators

13
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,759
or or whether they they the recipients of of of challenges and difficulty in

14
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:40,159
the world to hold peace to hold possibility of peace to live peace let

15
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:49,560
the let peace Start From Within um and and peace and meta loving kindness um

16
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,920
are strongly interrelated when we have good will for

17
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:04,520
others there is a sense of peace that arises in our heart and when we hold this space of peace and balance which is

18
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,720
related to equinity there is a sense of friendliness oh there's a sense of just

19
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:19,000
like me that can arise so just like me just like me let's

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,879
let's also remember just like me in fact maybe I'll share this I was

21
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:34,239
really touched by this recently I heard on the radio um it's the 30th Anniversary this week

22
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:41,680
or this past week I guess the 30th anniversary of of uh genocide in Rwanda

23
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:51,400
and and National Public Radio in the US was doing many um segments um and in one

24
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,519
segment I was quite touched there was the story of of a woman who 30 years ago risked her own

25
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:06,239
life to to um to save the lives of others uh when there was um

26
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,400
neighbor killing neighbor utus and tootsies and and I was especially

27
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,680
touched by one part of the story where um she apparently lets a couple of

28
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:26,319
people whom uh uh she and her husband knew in in their Village and she hides

29
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:33,000
these um these men in their house and then um her husband comes back and in

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,959
order to um for the husband not to be startled she says oh these these friends

31
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,439
you've known the they're visiting and and the words she said of course which

32
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,519
were translated uh through um through an

33
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,519
interpreter was you know just like just like me just like us these people want

34
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:04,280
to um to be alive not suffer just like me and that just like me it it

35
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,760
really touched me because the stance of common Humanity The Stance of common

36
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,720
Humanity you don't necessarily need to be a Buddhist or or be familiar with Buddhist teachings at all Buddhism does

37
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,680
not have hegemony over this simple understanding of just like me other

38
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:30,160
human beings are just like me just like me just like me and can we hold the

39
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:38,199
possibility of Peace for all of us on this little blue planet just like me

if you notice that you know the the happy hour uh guidelines or not being

164
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:22,399
met somebody else is giving somebody El advice it is okay to say you know the

165
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:28,559
with the with the uh invitations guidelines here we don't give advice we stay with the practice we stay here Etc

166
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:34,600
so so that's okay too because that comes out of Goodwill and and trying to hold

167
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:42,960
uh peace for everyone so so can you uh can you hold peace in

168
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:49,440
the way you listen in the way you speak in the relational space in the small

169
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,080
group of size three can you hold peace for yourself not add to the agitation

170

194
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:58,639
the alternative is um it came from here uh helping someone else uh that isn't a

195
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:06,440
direct benefit to myself that uh so I've started not giving money to Beggars but

196
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,760
going to a store and getting them a piece of pizza or a sandwich and so I

197
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,240
wasn't meaning it today to be a public event but someone else saw me go by and

198
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,118
said well you've done your good deed for the day so it wasn't my intention but it

199
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,960

00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,560
helping someone else who's who needs help needs support in that moment and and uh whatever that might be whatever

205
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:14,160
please thank you Nikki um that was a very powerful meditation for me and I

206
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:23,320
think it was partly primed by something I had been reading be before we sat down to meditate but uh initially I was just

207
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,960
overwhelmed with the perverse opposite of peacefulness and kind of immersion in

208
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,240
the headlines of the day and and then found myself even you know searching

209
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:41,480
further beyond beyond the uh the the terrible news of the moment to uh you

210
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,800
know what what's going on in my town that I don't know about uh which has its

211
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,920
own sort of secret Horrors and

212
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:59,680
and after a while you know not a long while but after a while then I I found that I okay can actually step out of

213
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:07,480
that I can step in to a place where I can um repos in my connection with

214
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,560
everybody and it was some of this came from imagery of what I had been reading

215
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:19,480
prior to our sitting down tonight and in that sense of you know

216
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:26,119
seeing the visual image of you know um many many little PODS of light

217
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:33,119
connected um and equal uh was was a peaceful place to be that that my

218
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:39,800
existence you know as I forget the phrase you were using but it was you know a sort of visual equivalent of the

219
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,920
phrase you were using about we all

220
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:54,720
share The Human Experience and we all um we all suffer in ways that aren't

221
00:36:54,839 --> 00:37:02,240
dissimilar and that none of us is really privileged beyond the other um but none

222
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:08,839
of us is underprivileged in relation to the other either and and that visual image of

223
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:15,760
those those that uh endless network of connection um without

224
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:24,480
faces but sort of pulsations of light was a place to that I could sit back in and uh and have a kind of sit back into

225
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:33,400
the calmness and peace and I was struck by how this was a choice and

226
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:39,800
that I had a a fair amount of ability to make that decision I I wasn't going to

227
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:47,240
be swept away by the headlines I actually could decide to step back into what I preferred and into the piece that

228
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:54,640
we were being directed to be in and that was interesting to see that degree of

229
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:02,960
bition um and which I imagine has developed from coming here

230
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,079
and sitting on my own but also you know from us doing what we do here in a large

231
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:15,720
group and in small little breakout groups and what reverberates

232
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,319
afterwards so thank you thank you thank you so much red and thank you for the

233
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:27,680
the both the eloquence and the nuanced way that you shared what what came came

234
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,480
up for you and the progression and I want to unpack a couple of things that you said for the benefit of others

235
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:39,319
because I think they're they're very important and and also subtle in your experience I was tracking you but just

236
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:46,000
to unpack what you were sharing um when you were talking especially

237
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:54,280
about uh the the you know the U all of us just like me all of us just you all

238
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:02,280
beings just like me there neither privilege no nor uh nor overprivileged nor underprivileged according to

239
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,640
particular ways of being and I wanted to unpack that because there's there's something very important in what you

240
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:13,839
said which could be misunderstood so I want to really unpack that because you know there's the idea of privilege in the world and some people are privilege

241
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:19,079
and you know they they have whatever wealth and some people don't you know all and yet what you're pointing to in

242
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:26,680
what you said so is with respect to um suffering that the the

243
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:32,000
unsatisfaction factor of life that the deep duka that all of us have in the

244
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,079
three actually the three marks of existence basically impermanence

245
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:44,480
unsatisfactoriness and impersonality which it's not we want to have control and choice yet we

246
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:51,319
don't and when we really see that yeah all of us human beings wow we're all

247
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:57,720
subject uh we're neither privil none of us have are have it you know we're all

248
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:03,920
subject let me put it this we're all subject to impermanence uh laws of impermanence

249
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,160
unsatisfactory no uh Dua um as well as

250
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:16,200
um that this this impersonality that it's not personal things and and and not

251
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:25,319
only things are impersonal but also they're unpredictable and when you truly see that through the eyes of of um of

252
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:31,119
insight um and there is a peace that arises that you then the mind and the

253
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:39,440
Heart can chooses to step you know the the Mind chooses to step into peace which also ties into this um teaching

254
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:48,920
Buddhist teaching um which is a beautiful one it's actually also used as a funeral chant in ply which is all

255
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:56,560
things are impermanent they um arise and pass away to live in harmony with this

256
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,680
truth brings great happiness and when you hear this at the outset it's like

257
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,520
wait Buddhists are so negative it's like what are they talking about but there's something about oh yeah the heart opens

258
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:14,599
up yeah this is this is how it is it's it's this I can see I can live according

259
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:20,520
to I can live and and as the friend recently put if we live according to in

260
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:27,599
if we live in harmony with uh uh impermanence unsatisfactory

261
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,160
not expecting it to be satisfactory all the time and not expecting it to be uh

262
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:40,960
everything that we have control over if we live in harmony with those truths life goes easier instead of us us um

263
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:48,000
fighting against them so all of this is connected and I hope people can hear the relationship between these points I'm

264
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,680
making and what you beautifully brought in Fred especially this this aspect of way I have a choice I can see through

265
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,880
this lens of of oh I can get you know kind fuff and and keep looking more and

266
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,319
more and more and I know what the feeling there is and and also um yeah I

267
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:11,760
I can I can choose I can choose to see the the universal truth of just like me

268
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,119
just like me in the world and that brings a certain Peace So I've said so

269
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:23,599
much and want to invite you if there's anything else You' like to add read or not no thank you yeah thank you

273
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:47,319

really great contemplation and meditation thank you very much for pointing me and US towards peace another

275
00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:00,559
person said I know we talk a lot about the inner critic uh what can we

276
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:06,720
practice um when the inner critic is Raging and regular and regular reminders

277
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:14,160
aren't working possibly due to Halt conditions I like you Jerry your halt is already becoming part of the zeit the

278
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:21,599
part of the um language of of of uh Happy a um mindfulness of the body to

279
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,720
the person who wrote that question mindfulness of the body and meta mindfulness of the body and meta bring

everyone I meet will die just like me everyone I meet is doing their best to get from point A to point B yes

283
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,000

284
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,400
of of Peace for me but neglecting marasti is even worse and I had glimmers

285
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,720
of marati supporting pieces well uh the marati means mindfulness of death which

286
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:11,160
is a practice I love to teach yeah this it's a practice because marati mindfulness of death can bring peace can

287
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:17,119
a sense of ah bring bring a sense of balance to all this yeah this can really

288
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:23,240
bring a sense of impermanence appreciation of impermanence to all this radical
