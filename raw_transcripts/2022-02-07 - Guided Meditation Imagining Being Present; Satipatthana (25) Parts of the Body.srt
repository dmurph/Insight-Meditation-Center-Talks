1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,080
so hello again and warm greetings on this beginning of the

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,240
week and we're continuing with the sati petana suta the

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,920
core buddhist buddha's teachings on mindfulness mindfulness practice

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,960
and this practice um aims at developing a great clarity of

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,520
awareness a clarity of of awareness a kind of a lucid awareness

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,440
that's very stable and very simple and allows that somehow in that clarity

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,320
and simplicity it sees things clearly in such a way that

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,000
liberation is within reach and so it's a state of mind that's

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,359
settled some would say concentrated composed

10
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,760
very present and very clear very attentive to the flow of experience in the present

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,760
moment and the text is all about the different exercises you can do

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,439
to build up to that quality of clear attention in the present moment

13
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,360
and many of us here in the west have learned certain aspects of this text

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,400
especially the ones that emphasize simple mindfulness non-reactive

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,720
mindfulness and in simple recognition of what's happening as it's happening in the

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,560
present moment and sometimes we get the impression that's all we're allowed to do

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,399
but in this text there's other practices to be done or can be done

18
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,320
that contribute to developing the mind overall so the mind be can have the stability

19
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,360
and strength to remain in the present moment and see clearly

20
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,960
and surprisingly one of those

21
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:10,000
things we develop is our capacity for imagination a kind of

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,080
the word that we're talking about right now pacha vekati vekati

23
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,120
is um can also mean to review with the word

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,440
view implying kind of a seeing so whether that reviewing is more mental

25
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,640
consideration thoughtful brings something to mind or whether it's

26
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,720
bringing evoking the imagination to visualize something that depends on the individual

27
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,640
practitioner but in a variety of ways and situations the buddha kind of relies on or calls on

28
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,000
very simple acts of imagination he does that when he evokes metaphors

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,519
for practice and um and we'll see now in this next exercise

30
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,840
there's a i'd like a beautiful metaphor um and somehow the evoking that

31
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,200
that what happens with him when we imagine a metaphor that speaks to something about what the

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,879
meditation is going to be about it kind of evokes those parts in our body and our mind and our hearts perhaps

33
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:21,360
so it comes a little bit of surprise that imagination has a role partly because other places the buddha

34
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,799
clearly is critical of how we get caught in fantasy and

35
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,400
and false imaginations but he uses a different word for that

36
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,840
and he has this word a couple of words he uses that are more positive for that probably mean closer to visualize

37
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,840
than simply imagination and and so this next exercise is used as

38
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,200
this and so as a way of introducing it for the meditation today

39
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,560
i'd like us to engage in a simple act of imagination to support the meditation practice

40
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,840
so it's not to imagine anything that's not present so you don't have to worry about being

41
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,840
taken off on some journey someplace with imagination but it is evoking the imagination to

42
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,639
support being here so um

43
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:24,079
taking a meditation posture lowering the gaze

44
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,400
relaxing the eyes relaxing the gaze

45
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,800
if it's comfortable closing the eyes

46
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:47,520
and in a way that is comfortable for you taking some deeper breaths

47
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,319
maybe three quarters full

48
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:02,479
exhaling no longer than you normally would but not so long that it's a strain

49
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,719
a delightful exhale

50
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:28,160
letting the letting the breathing return to normal and just hang out for a bit with the

51
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,560
rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

52
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,160
and if it's easy relaxing the body as you exhale

53
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,039
and then imagine yourself

54
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,800
sitting in meditation

55
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,319
maybe if you have it

56
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:43,280
easy ability to visualize visualize yourself sitting in meditation

57
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,880
it doesn't have to be exactly as you are but in some way that

58
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,400
the imagination the visualization the reflection

59
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,840
has some nice feeling to it nice quality

60
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,240
maybe your you might also imagine in your mind's

61
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,198
eye with your eyes closed the place in where you're sitting

62
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,240
letting your mind gently roam around left and right up and down

63
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,120
imagining visualizing the location where you are

64
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,599
and then again within your place imagine yourself

65
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,639
in your meditation posture

66
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,520
imagine that your body is beginning to relax

67
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,400
whether it actually relaxes or not is secondary

68
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,959
to simply imagine maybe you remember a time when the body

69
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,399
relaxed deeply and you imagine that that's how you are

70
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,399
now

71
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:04,640
imagine the relaxed way that you're safe here and now

72
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:13,560
surrounded by these few minutes with safety

73
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:33,839
imagine what it'd be like for your body to really feel itself in a safe place

74
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,839
what would relax in the body

75
00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:00,560
and imagine what it'd be like if in this imaginary meditation session

76
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,399
you felt content at ease

77
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,720
imagine the breathing what it would feel like to breathe and sit here

78
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,839
very contented at ease with all things

79
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:28,760
maybe visualizing yourself meditating this way

80
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:57,760
imagining a feeling of contentment spreading through the body

81
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,720
whether you're content or not is secondary

82
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:13,880
to the imagination that you are a gentle imagination

83
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,040
for people who have a hard time visualizing or imagining

84
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,200
imagine that you're visualizing imagine that you're imagining

85
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:37,279
so it's a very light touch imagining you're sitting here

86
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,839
in your meditation posture breathing in a content way

87
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,959
imagining what that would feel like

88
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,800
and now having spent some time imagining

89
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:15,120
let go of the imagination and let your awareness enter into your

90
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,399
body as it actually is

91
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:38,360
becoming aware of your embodied experience

92
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,480
as you exhale calming the mind

93
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,600
calming the thinking

94
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:58,839
centering your awareness on how your body experiences breathing

95
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,840
so

96
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,039
okay

97
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:44,640
and as we come to the end of the sitting notice if there's any ways that you are

98
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:51,919
calm or calmer more peaceful more settled

99
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:59,520
from this meditation or if you're not

100
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,240
do you have more clarity but how you actually are

101
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:12,440
simple recognition or a deep recognition

102
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:23,760
one way or the other sitting quietly in your meditation posture

103
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,639
not moving notice how you are

104
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,880
and to whatever degree there's a sense of stability

105
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,240
or stillness or non-reactivity to the world around you

106
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:01,600
imagine yourself being stable non-reactive

107
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:13,600
not closing down imagining that the people of your life

108
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:20,080
are coming into your view that you bring to mind those people you

109
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,760
might encounter today whether they're strangers or acquaintances or friends or

110
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,720
family neighbors

111
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:44,000
and see if you can have them be present in the mind's eye while you are non-reactive while you are

112
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,720
stable and steady maybe peaceful

113
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:04,000
imagining that you offer a stable attention sense of presence

114
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,840
non-reactive presence

115
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:20,960
and from this place this way do you have access to any thoughts

116
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,440
or imaginations how good it would be if these people could be happy

117
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,559
safe content peaceful

118
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,559
free

119
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:47,480
imagine that's possible and wish that to them

120
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,440
they be happy may they be

121
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:03,799
safe may they be peaceful

122
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,640
may they be free and may this good will

123
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,080
well wishing for the world spread out into the world through the

124
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,200
day and may each of us live

125
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,799
for the benefit of this world may all beings be happy

126
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,839
[Music]

127
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,360
thank you

128
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,760
uh

129
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:18,480
so in this um journey through the 13 exercises of the

130
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,840
buddha's discourse on the foundations for awareness for mindfulness

131
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:30,000
we've come now to the fourth exercise which is um

132
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,960
a mindfulness or a reflection on

133
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,000
parts of the body so all along we've been

134
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,960
doing mindfulness of the body developing a awareness that's embodied

135
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,399
being mindful of ourselves and postures and being mindful of us ourselves as

136
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:59,600
specific activities we do now that focus is on

137
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,880
um bringing more specificity to this mindfulness of the body

138
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:12,080
by becoming aware or mindful or focused on 31 different parts of the body

139
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:19,440
and and the way that the the verb that's used for what we do the activity

140
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,120
is a kind of i think of it as a rich word with connotations

141
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:32,399
that can mean to visualize to uh to see in the mind's eye it could

142
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:38,080
also mean to review or reflect on something which has a double meaning in

143
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:46,159
english as well where the word view means to look and the and the reflect has also the

144
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:51,440
kind of the meaning of association with seeing when we see our reflection in them

145
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,840
in the water for example in the mirror and exactly what kind what how the mind

146
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,960
is engaged in considering this is maybe depends on the person who does

147
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:09,120
it some people have a very strong ability to visualize and some people don't some people have

148
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,440
strong ability to maybe conceptualize uh what's being discussed

149
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:23,120
without actually seeing it there have been times where i had done visualization practices and

150
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,640
and um i never really felt i was particularly good at it being able to visualize

151
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:35,760
but it made a huge difference to me when i started imagining that i was visualizing

152
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,720
so it's i mean visualizing itself is a use of the imagination but somehow when i imagined i was doing it then i was

153
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,000
able to kind of kind of get into the event get into the

154
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,279
ideas that are being you know held up in the imagination

155
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:01,679
and um it was also very for me was much lighter touch because uh in the mind because when i

156
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:08,640
visualized that i found myself working too much but when i was imagining myself visualizing then there was no work in

157
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,240
just imagining it it was just kind of like more of an effortless place for me

158
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,600
and so exactly what this word reflect review imagine

159
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,440
visualize how it should be interpreted as maybe into very individual

160
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:33,440
and you're allowed to do that because this practice is about what supports you to develop clarity stability insight

161
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,600
and a certain freedom and and so and so what we're seeing here though

162
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,039
is that the satepatana uses a variety of different mental capacities

163
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:50,399
all for the same purpose of this lucid awareness that's being developed

164
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:57,279
and and so it's a as we do as we start learning these different capacities and recognizing in

165
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:03,360
which situation different ones of them are useful so to review some of the verbs that we

166
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:10,398
talked about so far one is to know like no we're breathing

167
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:16,000
the other is to experience to feel the whole body

168
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,320
and then there's the to relax or calm the bodily constructions

169
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,638
and then there's to know uh the different postures we're in and then there's to be have full

170
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:35,200
awareness or full comprehension while we're doing activities so

171
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,800
and then also we talked about in the refrain the capacity to observe to abide and

172
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,839
observe and now we're using a different mental capacity that a reflection or

173
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:53,520
visualization for something different people have different strengths in these different capacities

174
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,720
but they're all ways of engaging the mind now the 32 parts of the body

175
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,400
actually 31 parts of the body the text has 31. the later buddhist tradition

176
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,520
added the brain to the list and so there's 32. but

177
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:18,000
in the text it's only 31. and this is a cherished practice

178
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,760
for new monastics at least cherished by some um often in thailand and i don't know

179
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,480
about other countries when a monastic often when a person ordained as a monastic

180
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,839
this is the first practice they're given to cultivate these this practice on the

181
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:43,599
they do the 32 the 32 parts of the body and this has a variety of different

182
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:49,680
functions um one is that um you're supposed to memorize the list

183
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,839
and be able to recite it kind of with ease and there's something about the act of memorizing

184
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:03,040
uh doing the memorization and then do reciting things from memory that engages the mind in a very nice way

185
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:09,119
or hopefully a nice way there's something about the heightened attention that's needed to memorize

186
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:15,359
something the heightened presence that is beginning to train the mind or or

187
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:21,440
support the mind in having this heightened a certain kind of heightened attention for breathing

188
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:29,040
for present moment experience the the there's a kind of overlap between the kind of focus present moment

189
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,520
attention needed for memorization and the kind of focus attention we need to practice mindfulness in the present

190
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:42,880
moment and by memorizing we're learning something about a slightly activated mind or energized mind

191
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,160
that doesn't have to be tense or stressed but that shows us something about how to

192
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,720
be present that's not too laxadaisical not too complacent or not too lazy or something

193
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:01,119
like that a kind of clarity and intent intentness uh when you memorize that there's an

194
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:07,760
intenseness in what you're doing so in memorizing the list and then for monastics there's a lot of memorization

195
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,320
especially as a new monastics and some of that is not just to memorize the text so you can chant them

196
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,520
but it's also training the mind building up the strength of the mind

197
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,200
that supports also mindfulness practice this heightened

198
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:31,520
capacity of lucid awareness so the 31 parts of the body is

199
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,119
is engaging the mind the way that helps it get concentrated and concentration is a

200
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:43,280
very important part of mindfulness practice overall and so here we've kind of started with

201
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,200
mindfulness of the body and now we're introducing something that for many people supports them to get

202
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:56,000
more concentrated and to take the 31 parts of the body meditation seriously to develop that

203
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,040
concentration so that when we continue with the satipatana that we're supported by this

204
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:09,040
more concentration the second thing that it does is it this 31 parts of the body

205
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:15,680
meditation it it we get a different orientation of how to experience our body than what we

206
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:22,560
commonly do kind of unconsciously subconsciously carry around in our mind when we uh because of our culture

207
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:29,280
advertisements popular society family experiences we often have a self-image of ourselves

208
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:35,119
in our body which is a biased that's partial that's only has you know

209
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:40,800
this is not kind of the full picture of what goes on and not a few people have negative body

210
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,720
uh self images that they're troubled by their body or they're overly focused in their body or

211
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:53,440
they have positive views of their body and they're focusing on making themselves beautiful and just right

212
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,560
and so there's a whole focus on the body that is a multi-billion dollar industry

213
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:05,599
in this country maybe around the world a focus in the body that causes a lot of suffering a lot of stress

214
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,440
and and it doesn't really and it supports a certain kind of attachment or clinging

215
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,560
or grasping or fears aversions all kinds of things happen around how we

216
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:23,599
view the body and now this practice now is breaking through that to offer a

217
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,960
separate way of experiencing the body that is maybe a little more concentrated

218
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:35,599
has a different orientation perspective on the body and breaks up the solidity or the authority of these old body

219
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,440
images that we're burdened with or or which gets in the way of the mind settling deeply down into

220
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,280
some the alternative way of being in the body from the inside out

221
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,720
the third thing this these uh meditation on the 31 parts of the body does

222
00:39:52,720 --> 00:40:00,160
is that there's a way that um it's they're said to be unclean these parts of the body

223
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:06,960
or unpure uh and uh and if we focus on them the theory is if you focus on the body this

224
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,240
way that it breaks down not just the body image we have but excessive

225
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,920
attachment to the body and

226
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,960
the and

227
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:30,240
so for people who are very attached to the body uh seeing it this way these unclean things

228
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:36,079
um can break the attachment and the un one way of understanding that the way that they're unclean

229
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,760
so a lot of people in the west are very resistant to this idea to see the body is impure unclean

230
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:49,440
and in fact many you know those who have seen the inside of the body sometimes it seems quite beautiful to see the parts

231
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,240
is uh imagine that um person that you cherish and love and everything

232
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,680
and um you find their hair and your food your their pubic hair in your food or their

233
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,880
snot or you find that uh you know their skin sloughed off a lot

234
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,760
and it's in the stew that they made or fingernails are in food i think for many people the sense of

235
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:20,079
like body parts are beginning to appear in my stew is little bit like uh repulsive even

236
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,599
it's unclean it's not it's not quite right you don't want to eat it even though it's beautiful when it's on the other person but

237
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:31,040
you know something doesn't seem right about you know eating it if it's in the stew

238
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,200
and so it's maybe something like that that there's some perspective that's not unhealthy

239
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:43,920
that if we're attached to the body can help free it it is using the imagination

240
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:50,720
if it's needed for this purpose so uh the 31 parts of the body

241
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,760
i'll give the list and then i'll post the list for you so you can have it you can cut and paste it if you want and

242
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:02,720
and some of you i would encourage you to memorize it uh the list and see if you can

243
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,480
you know learn about this heightened attention that is useful for mindfulness that comes

244
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:16,800
from memorization so head here body here nails

245
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:25,119
teeth and skin flesh tendons bones marrow kidneys

246
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:32,880
heart liver diaphragm spleen and lungs

247
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,160
um bile uh phlegm

248
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:45,359
pus blood and sweat and

249
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:53,119
fat tears oil

250
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:58,839
saliva snot

251
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,240
the fluid of the joints and urine

252
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,760
so i think that oh no i left one out in the middle there intestines

253
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,760
large intestines small intestines contents of the stomach and um

254
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:22,079
feces so sorry i didn't do it all on the list but

255
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:27,520
that's that was that's a list and and um

256
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:34,480
and so that's the topic for the next two maybe three days and we'll practice with it and explore it and hopefully you'll

257
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,800
understand how rather than being a distraction from mindfulness uh you begin appreciating the wealth and

258
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,560
the richness the the range of what how the mind is engaged support the

259
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:52,480
direction of the mind becoming lucidly aware and present the movement towards freedom

260
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:59,760
so those of you incline memorize it and it's memorization this kind of memorization supports concentration

261
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:06,720
and also supports the practice of it um so um

262
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,400
thank you and
