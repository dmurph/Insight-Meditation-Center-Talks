1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,120
hello and am Monday here in California at the inside meditation

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,799
center and uh so we just finished the 25p part

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:23,279
introduction to mindfulness meditation and I have in mind to continue with that and with that series

4
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,960
or part two of it and uh we'll start here with this

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:37,879
meditation and um so the simple idea simplest idea of

6
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:44,600
mindfulness meditation is to be aware of what's Happening as it's

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:53,960
happening and not to do a checklist approach but to take the time to connect

8
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,120
to whatever is predominant uh to really know it well

9
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,439
and that can be in over a course of one breath a few breaths where we allow

10
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,880
ourselves to feel and sense and know what's happening and sometimes it's

11
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,880
panoramic and just everything coming and going and sometimes it's um centering on

12
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,400
something for a little bit so there's a settling a concentration that here so

13
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,119
the breathing works this way that we're here centering ourselves on the in inhale and the

14
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:39,159
exhale um knowing the inhale and exhale and uh and feeling it being with

15
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:46,640
it sometimes it's Body Sensations sometimes it's emotions sometimes it's thoughts sometimes it's

16
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,320
sounds and then I as I recommended in the intro series to let the breathing be

17
00:01:53,320 --> 00:02:00,719
the default the place where we're cultivating stability in addition to that being

18
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,399
present for being mindful of everything one very useful thing to be aware of as

19
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,879
you're aware of anything as you're aware of breathing the body emotions thoughts

20
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:21,599
is to recognize if there if there's any wanting of something or wanting not

21
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:28,519
wanting something the movements of wanting and not wanting so even in the middle of

22
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:35,040
being aware of something is there some subtle or maybe not so subtle wanting wanting a better

23
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,840
breathing wanting to get concentrated wanting to be a good meditator if there's

24
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:49,800
a ache in the knee is there a not wanting and the idea is to really take

25
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,560
time to recognize that to feel it not be troubled by the wanting or not

26
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,720
wanting but also not give preference to do it not let

27
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,879
it uh influence the simple moment to moment

28
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,480
awareness and how not to make it influence it is to include it as something to be

29
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,720
known oh so just simply to note

30
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,680
either note in the mind or just a non-verbal recognition this is wanting wanting is

31
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:36,319
present and um and then continue to practice so

32
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,480
the wanting also is in the domain of everything sometimes wanting or not

33
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,680
wanting is kind of like the stage director who's off stage and the

34
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:53,959
audience doesn't see what the stage director is telling people to do but uh the stage director is somehow in charge

35
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,439
the idea is everyone's on stage and so wanting not wanting is also brought on

36
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,680
the stage so we can see it clearly so that's the instructions for today so to

37
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,920
assume a meditation posture

38
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,759
um and to gently close your

39
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,639
eyes and sometimes wanting is

40
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,960
useful so as you sit here and begin see if you

41
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,240
can bring forth a gentle

42
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:53,160
wanting to be here present to be at this place at this time

43
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,240
aware of your

44
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,000
experience to enter a deeper relationship with

45
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,840
present moment sitting

46
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:19,800
here and gently taking some long slow deep breaths relaxing as you

47
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:36,720
exhale relaxing the shoulders with a long

48
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:48,720
exhale releasing the belly and a long

49
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
exhale

50
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:30,039
letting breathing return to normal and continue to relax relax on

51
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:36,479
the exhale softening throughout the

52
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
body

53
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,680
and then centering yourself on breathing as if the breathing is the

54
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,800
center of all

55
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
things

56
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,879
and then as you sit here meditating

57
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,879
today keep a lookout for the the arising of

58
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,639
Desire of wanting and not

59
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,520
wanting it maybe each thing that you're aware of in the

60
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:25,199
moment check it out and see is there any desire wanting or not wanting in

61
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,240
relationship to it and if there is

62
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,599
know it clearly that desire is

63
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:46,920
present and know it in such a way that you are not caught in the

64
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:55,839
desire so the desire is just a part of the landscape of your present moment

65
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
experience

66
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
for

67
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
for

68
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
e

69
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
e

70
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
for

71
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
for

72
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
e

73
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
e

74
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
e

75
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
e

76
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
e

77
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
for

78
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
for

79
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
e

80
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:30,519
what wanting or not wanting is operating in the foreground in the

81
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:45,880
background and what i' like to know it

82
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:56,639
clearly instead of going along with it by thinking about

83
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
it

84
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
e

85
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
for

86
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
for

87
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

88
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
e

89
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
e

90
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
e

91
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
e

92
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

93
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
e

94
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

95
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
e

96
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

97
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

98
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

99
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,760
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

100
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,480
to maybe take a moment to distinguish between different kinds of

101
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,278
desires you might have in relationship to other

102
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,799
people there's the desire to want something from

103
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,679
them and there's also the desire to want something for

104
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:32,840
them might be easier to see that the desire

105
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,960
to want something from them serves

106
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:43,799
yourself desire for them serves

107
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:48,919
them and the feeling of the two the way these two operate in our bodies and

108
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:53,919
minds and hearts can be very

109
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:01,240
different and for the next couple of minutes to consider the the desires you

110
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:10,240
have for the well-being of others how you wish them

111
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,120
well where does that desire come from within

112
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:26,600
you how does that desire arise so

113
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:32,159
that it has a healthy feeling to it a goodness to

114
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:38,520
it a Simplicity that is a

115
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:48,120
wishing but not a needing a desire but not an

116
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:59,120
attachment and as you breathe maybe breathing through your heart center and imagine that in your

117
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,559
exhale you are spreading your well-wishing into the

118
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:10,760
world in front of you behind you to the side of you in all

119
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,720
directions may all beings be

120
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,520
happy may all beings be safe

121
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,080
may all beings be

122
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,679
peaceful may all beings be

123
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:53,320
free and may each of us are well wishing of

124
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:58,750
others be good for our own Hearts to have a

125
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:04,519
[Music] healthy generosity of care for

126
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:09,200
others may all beings be

127
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:20,980
[Music]

128
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,440
happy thank you

129
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
for

130
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:36,360
so welcome to this Monday a Dharma talk which is now beginning of part two

131
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:43,799
of the introduction to mindfulness meditation and um for this week I would

132
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:50,840
like to talk about the hindrances there's five hindrances and people who do mindfulness

133
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:59,120
meditation one of the kind of standard things to do is to become um well

134
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:06,679
familiar with how the hindrances work in us and the value is that we want to

135
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:12,559
understand what hinders our ability to be aware to be mindful and this is a

136
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:21,080
wonderful principle that the very thing that is the obstacle uh is becomes

137
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:27,480
the the practice so rather than letting it remain the obstacle that Hinder

138
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,600
awareness because we get pulled into trained thoughts of the

139
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:38,399
hindrances um we turn around and make the hindrances the object of the

140
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:47,880
mindfulness and what's brilliant about that is that it doesn't require the hindrances to go away to reestablish

141
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:54,640
mindfulness we establish mindfulness on the very challenge we have and this

142
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:02,679
is one of the important principles of aasa practice in general is is not an avoidant practice but rather a practice

143
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:09,279
that turns towards uh that stands near stands stands next to what's happening and able

144
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,639
to accompany it to see it to know it without becoming it without being

145
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:20,399
entangled with it and so um so rather than being upset

146
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:26,720
when we can't be mindful it just uh not being able to be mindful is an indication that we need to

147
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,120
turn our attention to something different than we have been paying attention to to the very thing that's

148
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,639
making it difficult so if there's a lot of thinking for example that takes people

149
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:43,880
away then we want to practice mindfulness of thinking but sometimes even that's not

150
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:52,919
enough and sometimes what's propelling the thinking what's propelling our caught upness is some form of Desire

151
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:59,840
some form of hindrance and there's five hindrances uh desire is the first uh

152
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:06,159
more technically it's sensual desire the second is aversion so not

153
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:12,080
wanting something wanting something to go away and the the third is usually

154
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,679
translated as sloth and torper but uh in that that kind of fits the hindrance of

155
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:24,080
the of fear quite a bit it might be more appropriate to translate it as uh uh

156
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,080
sloth and rigidity rigidity and torper

157
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,880
and um and then there is restlessness and

158
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:42,880
regrets and then there's doubt so these are the five seven actually but two of them are pair two of them are

159
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,919
Pairs and um so

160
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:54,519
desire desires are important part of life and they the very thing which trips

161
00:32:54,519 --> 00:33:00,919
us up in our lives desires free us from trouble and desires put us

162
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:08,919
in trouble and so desires are multifaceted and beginning to recognize

163
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:14,799
desires as desires is phenomenally helpful if you can recognize the desires

164
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:20,080
as desires then you have a chance then to feel and sense and experience what

165
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,399
it's like having the desire and some Desires in and of

166
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:30,559
themselves feel like our freedom is compromised feels like that we are

167
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:37,799
caught in something we're being compelled being pushed it's almost like we lose our

168
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:43,039
self-determination because a desire overwhelms us so you know compelling us

169
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:51,000
to act in a certain way other forms of Desire do not limit our freedom doesn't limit our

170
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,919
capacity to stay grounded and centered here uh actually supports it supports us

171
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,600
to be centered supports us to be present and be and the feeling of those desires

172
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:11,919
can feel even nourishing they can feel right they can feel like they're part and parcel of a centered grounded way of

173
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:18,000
being alive and present and the second desire is

174
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,158
connected to mindfulness that what we're trying to do in mindfulness is to

175
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:30,000
establish awareness here the Foundation of mindfulness Foundation of awareness

176
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:39,240
is stability this uh being here in a clear way so that we're abiding living

177
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:46,440
in Awareness not living in abiding in the desires not abiding in the thoughts

178
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,839
that we're having and so when and when thinking and desires get

179
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:58,920
merged then we can be in trouble because then the mind gets Swept Away in thought

180
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,359
propelled by the desire uh and if um and if there's a lot

181
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:11,960
of attachment together with the desire then there can be the thinking can be comp compulsive and when the thinking is

182
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:19,000
compulsive then sometimes the behavior becomes compulsive too uh the pressure is so

183
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:27,079
strong and one of the things that happens with his compulsive desires and that compell thinking a lot

184
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:34,119
is that uh we get caught in the hindrance of desire and as I said it's often

185
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:39,240
translated as the hindrance of sensual desire sometimes it's it's in the

186
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:45,200
ancient text it's also described as the hindrance of acquisitiveness wanting to have

187
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:52,839
something and um to acquire something for myself and um and of course there you

188
00:35:52,839 --> 00:36:00,720
it's okay to acquire things uh that are healthy for us and when we acquire them in healthy ways but it's the uh the

189
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:07,200
greed the clinging the grasping the compulsion the pushing that um becomes

190
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,400
the hindrance that makes it difficult to be present diff difficult to be centered

191
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,480
here difficult to stay aware as opposed to being pulled away into the train uh

192
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:26,560
the trains of train cars of of thinking over and over again so what we want to be able to do

193
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:33,720
is begin to recognize when desires are there and um and desires are there a lot

194
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,960
so it shouldn't be too difficult to begin recognizing Desires in the course

195
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,000
of your daily life you might stop a few times maybe on the hour every hour and

196
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,400
just um have some kind of alarm that goes off and then say what what desire am I involved in right

197
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,480
now um in you know if you find yourself in a supermarket well there is some

198
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:02,359
desire to cut you there you're looking for something to buy you want something there it's maybe every aisle aisle

199
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:08,160
you're on you're looking for what you want you're based you know they searching there's nothing wrong with

200
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,040
that but what's the quality and the nature of that desire does it feel if

201
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,079
you really check in about how you're Desiring does it feel relaxed and easy

202
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:24,800
does it feel nice and comfortable or is it uh is it tight and

203
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:31,560
stressful to have it uh if you find yourself driving your car

204
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,839
what is the nature of Desire there and if you're driving fast does that tell

205
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:43,240
you something about how you're living in your desires um and uh if you're driving with

206
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:48,440
a lot of impatience that's tell you something about nature of your

207
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:56,319
desires if you um you know are doing anything at all if you're uh talking on

208
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:03,480
the phone phone or answering an email what desires are operating there and is that desire you have does it feel good

209
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,680
to have or when you really pay attention to it it's stressful and strain full

210
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:15,839
there's desires all the time and you can get tied up in knots if you're look at every desire carefully but to begin

211
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,760
becoming cognizant of desires so that you can begin centering yourself on

212
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:29,400
desires which are healthy and you'll learn to recognize when they're not good for you or for other people and then you

213
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:36,960
learn because you learn to become familiar with them and you know them well what they feel like slowly you learn how to be free of

214
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:43,520
desires and ideally we're free of both good desires and bad desires healthy and

215
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:50,160
unhealthy ones the healthy ones too is possible to have clinging and grasping but we want to even healthy ones we want

216
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:57,880
to hold lightly and present act on if it's appropriate so sitting in meditation

217
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:03,040
then uh one of the things to become aware of is the functioning

218
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:10,400
desire and part as I said part of the reason to sit and become calm and centered and stable here maybe something

219
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:17,160
that happens over the course of a meditation session one of the functions of that is so once we're stable then

220
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,839
we're going to be in a have a vantage point in which to feel or sense or

221
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:29,240
experience desires when they arise we can see then there oh now there's a wanting there's thoughts not just

222
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:36,480
thinking going on but there's thoughts driven by desire fantasies are thoughts driven by

223
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:43,040
desires usually and so you might from the beginning of this just keep it very

224
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:49,119
simple just recognizing oh there's a desire as opposed to deciding exactly

225
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:55,480
what the desire is um maybe that can be for later but see what kind of Freedom

226
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:02,760
comes for just really clearly recognizing this is a desire I'm not proposing this to make

227
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:09,200
your meditation busy a lot of searching and looking and analyzing but the idea is once you're

228
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,280
kind of arrived and centered and stable here then you might want to be on the

229
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,520
lookout uh keep an eye out for it or it might be most useful before you become

230
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,920
centered it because the very thing that's keeping you from beginning into the present moment and makes it

231
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,119
difficult when you sit down is because the spinning of your thoughts is driven

232
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,359
by some strong desire and uh it might be useful to sit

233
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:41,720
down and see oh look at that no wonder it's hard to be settled right now

234
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:47,240
there's a desire that's very compelling and compulsive that's still caring with

235
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:53,240
me desire to think something or figure something out or plan something planning

236
00:40:53,240 --> 00:41:00,520
is a is you know is a usually a desire and um

237
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:06,920
so in order to so I'll repeat this very important principle that the very thing

238
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,520
that makes it difficult to be mindful that's the thing to be mindful

239
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:18,079
of and one of those things can be desire and that's one of the key places in

240
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:24,200
meditation where you want to check in and see where's the desire here that is

241
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:29,680
when you're not able to be easily present the mind's drifting off a

242
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,160
lot then check in what's the desire that's operating here there some way of

243
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,880
clearly recognizing knowing the desire feeling it in your body that uh where it

244
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:47,480
begins to lose its grip on you and maybe then becomes easier to continue with

245
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:55,040
your um with your meditation so thank you very much and uh

246
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,079
so we'll continue with the ances this

247
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,920
week
