1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:10,519
hello everyone and no warm greetings and

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,000
sitting here with you wishing you all a

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,039
meaningful meditation or a satisfying one

4
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,578
even when it's not satisfying though it can be quite beneficial sometimes even more beneficial

5
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:40,440
because the very things that make meditation difficult are often the very things that

6
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,260
mindfulness it's useful to bring mindfulness to might be very important to be mindful of

7
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,860
and and learn something new find a new way

8
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:58,460
be with oneself in a productive way with the difficulty

9
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,860
so one of the

10
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,380
common descriptions of mindfulness practice you

11
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,619
find here in the west is that it's a form of acceptance practice

12
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:24,600
and uh and maybe so and I'll talk more about that later but right now I'd like to offer you

13
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,080
a very important Baseline orientation for doing Buddhist

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:37,860
Meditation for doing mindfulness practice that is akin to Acceptance in a certain

15
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:45,360
way but doesn't require doing something and often people have the impression

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:53,460
that a meditation is a lot about doing sometimes acceptance is understood as a

17
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,159
as a ceasing of a lot of the doing that we do and in a sense that's what I want to

18
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:06,299
emphasize today that as you do the meditation today

19
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:13,440
um rather than trying to Focus so much on being mindful

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:21,260
rather than focusing a lot on some ideal like to be compassionate for yourself or kind to yourself

21
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,739
focus on non-harming

22
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:32,040
being attentive enough to track what your mind does

23
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,980
the thoughts the attitudes the motivations the the

24
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:44,580
actions you want to do and simply avoid

25
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:53,540
anything that could be seen as being harmful even if it is the harm is not

26
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,720
strong but certainly any thing in the in the

27
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,440
category of aversion hatred ill will

28
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:15,420
towards yourself or towards others towards the meditation any movement of greed and desire which

29
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:23,659
causes stress and strain any copying caught up in

30
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,300
all kinds of thoughts about doubt and confusion and

31
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:37,800
fantasy and all which kind of interfere with the

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:46,379
kind of deep intimacy a deep capacity for being at ease Here and Now

33
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,540
so what would happen to this meditation if you're attentive

34
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,959
to avoid causing harm the harm that comes from being alienated

35
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,860
alienated from yourself when we're caught up in Lost in thought

36
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,739
so if any of those movements of Mind happen

37
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,840
let them be don't be involved in them don't get behind them

38
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,320
no need to be critical that they occur just let them be

39
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,660
the Buddhist question is to let thee or not to let be that is the

40
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:42,440
question and often the thing to do is to let be Let It Be don't get involved

41
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,300
so assuming a meditation posture

42
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,860
a posture that feels good for you

43
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:04,080
but also good because it brings a kind of alertness to the body

44
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,418
and maybe with the alertness of the body

45
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,639
no alertness in the mind

46
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,100
gently closing your eyes

47
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:34,319
and begin by remembering or sensing imagining finding

48
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:41,220
what it might be like to have a mind and attitude

49
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,840
of non-harming

50
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,979
a mind that's not harming because

51
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,919
it has a strong connection to a sense of ease

52
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:13,280
a sense of Peace Within imagining that kind of mind and heart

53
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:25,139
and taking a few long slow deep breaths and as you exhale

54
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:32,400
relax into that possibility possibility of non-harming

55
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,199
a heart that doesn't want to harm

56
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:53,340
and if any harming Tendencies arise it could be annoyance criticism self-criticism

57
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:01,800
some subtle attitude of that of that in which we undermine

58
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,220
ourselves let that be

59
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,780
don't be involved in it

60
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:20,699
relax on the exhale relax into

61
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:27,840
so you approach the place within

62
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:35,478
that's at ease and at peace not in conflict with anything

63
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,520
breathing in and breathing out

64
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:32,940
approaching meditation as a practice of non-harming

65
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,039
foreign

66
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:21,020
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

67
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:34,440
perhaps consider the benefits that come from non-harming

68
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:44,400
what this world would be like if there was a heightened dedication to

69
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,360
non-harming

70
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,840
what it would feel like for you to live in a world where you were

71
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,960
confident you would not be harmed

72
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:28,340
and perhaps how you would like to support others

73
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:34,260
and have the experience of not having to worry about being

74
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,740
harmed

75
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,020
and perhaps that's one of the gifts you can give

76
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:53,840
a dedication of living a life of not harming

77
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:01,679
may it be that others can rest

78
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:08,580
assured that they will not be the recipients of

79
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:18,919
hate and ill will meanness meanness and bullying and

80
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,639
snide remarks

81
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:30,740
May It Be

82
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,840
that all beings may be happy

83
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,659
may be safe maybe peaceful

84
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:48,679
maybe free

85
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,600
and to be able to live

86
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:06,620
without an ongoing worry of being harmed by anyone

87
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,380
including by themselves

88
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:23,120
then may we that be dedicated to creating such a world

89
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:31,158
by living it with a dedication to not harm

90
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:41,670
[Music]

91
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,860
thank you

92
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,960
and while I'm waiting for the recorder here to reset so I can push the record

93
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,140
button as mentioned again that tomorrow that

94
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:50,520
when this is over it's that um hit the quarter to the hour 7 45 in

95
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:57,000
California uh I'll open a zoom room and we can have a

96
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,039
7 A.M community uh meeting

97
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:09,240
and um I thought it'd be nice partly because I'll be away for the following month and

98
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,279
then nice to check in and say hello and maybe answer questions you might have

99
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:22,200
we'll probably do a breakout group I'll post the later today the zoom link

100
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:29,640
and what's new in the home page of imc's website I'll post it in um

101
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:36,440
in the calendar and also tomorrow morning I'll put it in the chat

102
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,980
so another announcement is that this Sunday this Sunday IMC is going to have

103
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:50,760
a potluck kind of a we call it a potluck picnic from 11 o'clock to 1 00 p.m here

104
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:57,539
at IMC after the morning meditation and teaching so those of you

105
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:04,380
who live close enough it's a chance to come together in community and um

106
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:12,799
we'll do it outside and and then thank you for that

107
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:25,020
so continuing uh the theme of appreciation

108
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:33,480
as a foundation for compassion a form of appreciation part of this the

109
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:41,340
next appreciation more valuable and richer is our ability to accept people as they

110
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:46,919
are and this is a nuanced kind of topic

111
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,980
because of course there are people who do things that we can't accept

112
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:59,159
and and so you know we're not condoning or allowing

113
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:04,940
them to continue to do things which are harmful but

114
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:12,779
so one of the aspects of acceptance but at the same time it's profound for

115
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:20,159
some people to be accepted as they are there are people plenty of people in this society that are not accepted for

116
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:27,539
basically you know for who they are and and um and so

117
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:33,960
um to because it goes everywhere they go there's people not accepting them not including them marginalizing them

118
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:41,399
ignoring them because somehow they're not accepted they

119
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:49,200
the non-accepting people might think that they're not being prejudiced or not being hostiled but the subtle ways in

120
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:56,820
which people keep silent or Overlook them or ignore them or prioritize other people to give their

121
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:02,760
attention to and the some people it's quite dramatic

122
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,760
that how they're not accepted some people it's subtle but it takes its toll

123
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:15,480
over a long time and because it's such a common phenomena in the world of people in some way or

124
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:21,560
they're not accepted not that we don't make room for them we don't include them

125
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:27,240
in our efforts to be inclusive of

126
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:33,000
be friends to befriend people that it's such a powerful thing to do

127
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,040
and some people it's rare they rarely get accepted for

128
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:45,240
themselves for how they are and to have someone who sits down with them and just there and accepts them as they are

129
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:50,398
um I've known homeless people who said when I sat down on a bench with them and

130
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:56,940
just talked with them some of you could see something inside of them relaxed and and at first they felt kind of cautious

131
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:02,820
and I remember one person who said oh I can go I don't have to be here as if they

132
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:08,220
didn't belong there but I reassured them it was okay and and we had a nice little

133
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:15,000
conversation um and um so to accept people is a profound thing

134
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,820
but how to do it in a way that is appropriate for oneself and for others

135
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:27,060
is part of the art of it and uh so it's a little hard to know all the ins and

136
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:34,339
outs of when acceptance is appropriate and not but I'd like to propose that one of the

137
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:40,320
kind of first criteria first kind of entry points to a radical acceptance of

138
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,839
others is to be dedicated towards not harming them

139
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:51,900
to have that as a clear guideline so certainly that can be any kind of

140
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:57,180
intentional harm that we would that we do for them if we have hate we have ill

141
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:03,240
will we um complain about them we blame them we

142
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:09,980
criticize them we mix night comments about them

143
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:16,260
many many forms of harm are caused by words we speak and So to avoid causing

144
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:22,140
harm and um and uh

145
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:28,079
and then we also harm by our attention if who we attend to with our attention

146
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:35,940
who we notice who we who we don't notice who we ignore and and to notice a little bit how we're

147
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:42,060
using our attention socially who do we prioritize who do we zero in on and who

148
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:47,339
is not included in our attention then is are we causing harm by exclusion By

149
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:53,160
ignoring uh who is it that feels ignored who feels marginalized in the room and is

150
00:36:53,160 --> 00:37:01,740
there some way to include them and in the conversation if they're standing there and and um and and you know not

151
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:06,900
being actively included so so as we move along in this

152
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:12,240
investigation consideration of non-harming uh it's also taking other people into

153
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,339
account what is experience like for them what's happening for them

154
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:23,880
what do they need and for people who are causing harm people who are saying things that are

155
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:29,880
mean or people who are doing other things um is there some way to accept them that

156
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,280
gets underneath the action they do and so this common idea that we accept

157
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:41,280
can separate the person from their actions then we might be able to have some way

158
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:48,900
of not accepting the actions but accepting the person and not being hostile to the person

159
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:56,880
saying no to the actions but saying yes to the person so for example one might might say that

160
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,540
without being angry back at someone who says something mean to us we might say

161
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:09,599
oh wow that that those words they stung I feel hurt by those words they were

162
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,540
difficult to hear and um and I you know and I care for you but

163
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:21,480
not the words so that kind of turning it around

164
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:28,560
it's little difficult for people then to continue saying harmful words if you

165
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:35,400
kind of tell people the impact has had and then immediately turn around and appreciate them in some way or hold them

166
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:41,099
in some view of kindness or uh have some acceptance of them as a

167
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:47,820
person and what needs to be accepted in people so it might not be the whole person but

168
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:54,480
the person saying mean words it might mean what needs what needs to be accepted is that they're scared or

169
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,079
they're lonely or they're pretty upset and frustrated and so just you know oh

170
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:07,980
those words you spoke they stung and um and you know I wonder

171
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:14,400
if you're feeling you know sad or tired and and can I do something for you can

172
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:21,619
we kind of support you can I bring you some some coffee or something to change the language to not to buy in

173
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:26,880
to the tone of voice or the attitude or even the strategy that people are doing

174
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,280
that you don't like or is hard for hard to not participate in not to gauge it in

175
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:40,200
those on its terms but somehow uh you know step aside from that and return

176
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:46,800
to the person addressing some aspect of the person that maybe needs acceptance needs needs

177
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:53,040
support needs something that maybe undermines the the uh pulls

178
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:00,420
the the energy away from the harming Behavior so this is not easy to do

179
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:09,420
um but uh if we're dedicated to a life of non-harming then just that itself might be seen as

180
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:15,960
an acceptance but it could be naive but if we really try to understand

181
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,540
what's going on for the person so you know we want to appreciate people

182
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:27,000
what can be appreciated we want to understand them what's really

183
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,960
going on here what's going on on the surface what's what's deeper than their behavior that we don't like

184
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:41,880
what um you know what can we respect can we

185
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:48,660
respect the person not the behavior and then can we kind of be here with an

186
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:55,619
accepting way and I've been in situations where people have been angry angry at me I think it

187
00:40:55,619 --> 00:41:01,800
wasn't Justified but they were angry with me and sometimes it has been Justified

188
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:08,760
and um and my ability to be accepting of the situation accepting of the person's

189
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,760
anger making room for it not accepting it because I condone it or I approve of it

190
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:20,579
but being there and allowing myself to experience it allowing myself for that

191
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:26,400
to be there so that something different can happen so it's not a fight between that person

192
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:34,260
and me so one of the nuanced the deeper ways that this topic of acceptance uh works

193
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:42,839
that I think is uh kind of key to all of it working is um is we accept whatever the

194
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:49,260
situation is whatever it is and that's a radical thing to say we accept it into

195
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:55,940
awareness we allow awareness to receive it to know it

196
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:02,060
and that's it very different uh what we might do in response what we might say

197
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:09,140
how we might evaluate the situation is a different

198
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,460
activity within but to allow it to come into awareness

199
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:21,079
so awareness doesn't shut down that somehow with our awareness we're not already resisting or stopping or or

200
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:26,400
attacking there's something about the peaceful experience of allowing yourself

201
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,760
to be aware of something they'll be accepted into awareness

202
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:39,000
and that hopefully allows us to respond uh in a wise way and will know what to

203
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,180
do and and uh and maybe in making room to allow ourselves to experience it to

204
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:51,000
be aware of it that um that the other person will feel

205
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,900
something's different going on here um this is not different that's not what I'm not what not what I'm used to

206
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:04,140
when this is someone who so someone who's sad and upset for example not

207
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:10,079
doing harm um they're they're surprised by someone who has the ability to be calm and

208
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:15,359
peaceful and attentive to their sadness and

209
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,760
and so we're able to accept the sadness and open to it so we don't have to fix

210
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:28,800
it right away or or you know get too involved too quickly

211
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,200
so accept the acceptance acceptance this kind of acceptance and

212
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:41,700
awareness allowing awareness to be accepting I think gives a lot more power to our

213
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:50,460
appreciation and respect of others because then where there's a cleaner Channel cleaner kind of transmission of

214
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:57,180
of appreciation and a clear transmission of respect that we give

215
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:02,640
so elements of appreciation depreciation

216
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,520
itself gratitude valuing people

217
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:13,920
then there's understanding people uh without understanding there can't be

218
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:21,480
depreciation can't be that deep there's respect to respecting people again giving the treating them as

219
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:27,119
valuable human beings valuable enough for us to pay attention to

220
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,339
and as we pay attention to pay attention with an accepting attention

221
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:37,680
so that something deeper can happen in our acceptance and um

222
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:45,480
we know what to accept in the person so one more time tomorrow and the last

223
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,579
element of appreciation and thank you very much for being part

224
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:56,240
of this and and I look forward to our time tomorrow
