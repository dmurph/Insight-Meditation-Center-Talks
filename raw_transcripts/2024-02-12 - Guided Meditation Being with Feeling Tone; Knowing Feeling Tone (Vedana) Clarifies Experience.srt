1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:06,279
so lovely lovely good to see you

2
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:12,400
all for those of you who don't know me my name is Don Neil and I'm here picking

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,920
up a little bit on the themes that Gil spoke about in the last

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:26,320
number of weeks mind his introduction to mindfulness theories breath body emotions and

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,759
thoughts and this week I'll be offering a series on the course elements of

6
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:38,760
mindfulness which are feeling tones and ways of working with awareness ways of

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,559
working with attention so that's a very brief overview of the

8
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,079
week and today the first of these elements of

9
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,800
mindfulness I'll be covering is V Pleasant unpleasant and neutral

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,439
feeling tone that is a very very simple kind of overlay or

11
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:10,640
um assessment our systems make about the raw sensory data of

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,640
life so that's the basic overview and

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,960
I'll ask you to start to settle into meditation I'm loving seeing the

14
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:32,600
greetings from people in Santa Cruz especially um but maybe weave back and forth a

15
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:39,240
little bit get yourself in Balance over your hips or in Balance alignment if

16
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,439
you're lying down have your spine and your um head

17
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:53,920
aligned and just to by way of introducing the meditation and talk about how feeling

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,840
tone is a really simple way sometimes powerful way we can relate to experience

19
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:11,080
so you may want to just notice throughout the meditation if you're leaning in or leaning away from anything

20
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,360
in your experience because it feels good or because it doesn't feel good and this

21
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:23,080
can be physical mental emotional and remember for the purpose

22
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,239
of mindfulness any object is as good as any

23
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,959
other object of attention unpleasant

24
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:40,640
experience isn't wrong or bad it just is pleasant experience is

25
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,080
lovely it's not inherently a better thing to pay attention to for the

26
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,800
purpose of mindfulness so settling in to

27
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:04,519
meditation perhaps starting with two or three deeper slower

28
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:19,680
breaths and in these deeper slower breaths allowing the exhale to be longer

29
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,040
than the

30
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
inhale

31
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,239
and noticing as you settle

32
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,840
in how the breath is today is it

33
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:56,159
Pleasant maybe tune into the pleasant if it's

34
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,200
unpleasant I call that cardboard breath just notice noticing

35
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:13,040
that perhaps it's neither it's neutral or some undefined feeling in

36
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:30,400
between allowing the breathing to be natural maybe doing a quick SK in

37
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,880
through your

38
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,320
body and just noticing throughout your body throughout your sensory experience

39
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,280
of your body areas that are

40
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:53,919
Pleasant

41
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,720
unpleasant or in that fast territory in between just

42
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,800
experience no need to hang out

43
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,360
there just

44
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:25,160
allowing and then tuning [Music] in to whatever anchor of attention makes

45
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:31,479
the most sense for you

46
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,479
the breath coming and going like

47
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,199
waves The

48
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,440
Body Sensations coming and

49
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,479
going scintillating like water

50
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,240
or perhaps it's Ambient sound tuning

51
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,880
in and resting for a while in the lived

52
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,560
sensations of

53
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,479
breath of being

54
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
alive

55
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:49,759
allowing yourself to abide in this

56
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,319
moment just as it is

57
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,120
tuning in again to whatever sensation or

58
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,120
experience is predominant and simply notice its tone

59
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,160
tone it's feeling

60
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:14,600
tone it's that pleasurable an enjoying

61
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:24,079
savoring not pleasant

62
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:34,880
allowing is it neither simply being

63
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,120
with noticing any little motions towards or

64
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,560
away in your

65
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:54,600
being any resistance any

66
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:03,600
wanting and also noticing the Simplicity of a allowing just

67
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
being

68
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,600
allowing the mind the heart to rest in

69
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:21,798
experience and noticing any movement towards or

70
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:30,400
away perhaps gently mentally noting Pleasant

71
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,919
unpleasant and

72
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
allowing

73
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,000
noticing if your attention is

74
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:56,559
pulled by a new sensation or [Music]

75
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,240
sound notice ing the quality of

76
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:09,440
that is it Pleasant not so

77
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,120
pleasant or just

78
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
is

79
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,640
and in the last remaining moment of this

80
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:33,278
meditation the invitation is to notice that there's a part of the Mind the

81
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:41,240
heart unmoved unaffected by whether what is flowing

82
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,520
through is pleasurable or

83
00:26:50,720 --> 00:27:00,639
not perhaps noticing the quality of mindful awareness just simple

84
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,480
attention on whatever is unfolding In This

85
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
Moment

86
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,519
and as we bring this meditation to a close

87
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:11,320
casting your inner Gaze on any moments of clarity or

88
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:17,720
mindfulness ease and appreciating

89
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:29,440
them and casting your inner gaze outwards to the others in your life

90
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:37,919
those close or on the margins of your life those near those far

91
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,880
away known and unknown and wishing them

92
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:54,440
well making the

93
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:03,480
determination that this practice be of benefit to the others in your life as well as

94
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:18,039
yourself May the benefits of our practice here together Ripple

95
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
outwards

96
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,320
thank you for your practice

97
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
this

98
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,880
so good morning again sa special good morning to those of you who may have tiptoed in late into the YouTube chat

99
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:59,519
into the international meditation s we have here

100
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,600
together it's a delight to be with you

101
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:11,679
and I'm just going to jump in now with our theme for the day for the

102
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:19,240
week so the theme this week is mindfulness of the different ways our

103
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,880
systems can know experience elements of mindfulness that

104
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,799
will complement the introduction series Gill has been doing for the last number of weeks

105
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:36,519
now and the first of these elements today's topic is very simple it's Vena

106
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:42,399
feeling tone the tonality or the quality of

107
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:48,279
direct experience in Buddhist teachings all

108
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:54,399
experience is categorized at its most basic level in one of three broad

109
00:31:54,399 --> 00:32:00,159
categories Pleasant unpleasant or neither Pleasant

110
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:07,320
nor unpleasant which is huge territory that we often ignore because it's not interesting enough it gets really

111
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:14,760
interesting if you really be with it V itself is the poly word for this

112
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:22,039
feeling tone and it's related to the word Veda or V to know to

113
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:29,080
experience this simple direct way of knowing person

114
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:37,000
experience okay so it's simple why does it matter well noticing feeling tone in

115
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,519
practice is a key place that prevents getting lost in wanting or not wanting

116
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:49,440
desire or aversion ending up on those party boats or War boats that Gil often

117
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,080
talks about with thinking where an entire flow of thought

118
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,679
will just take us away from our place place at the riverbank that solid place

119
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:07,720
of mindfulness and get lost it can also noticing feeling tone

120
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:13,080
can also clarify how thoughts are thoughts and

121
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,399
emotions or emotions and the impact that a thought

122
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:25,080
or emotion has on us in a really simple way so here's an example of how Vena can

123
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:30,600
shift based on context what's

124
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:37,679
happening imagine yourself on a beautiful day taking a hike or a walk in

125
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,799
the woods Sun dappling through the shade of the trees and the birds are singing

126
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:48,200
and it's an idilic temperature and it's just

127
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:55,960
gorgeous luxurious green Fage little waterfalls this can be highly Pleasant

128
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:03,480
right and and it can be really unpleasant if

129
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:10,919
you're completely lost I don't know where I'm going all of the sudden my mental feeling tone takes

130
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:17,960
over and the birds are still there and the dappled light is still there but

131
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:26,000
there's anxiety there maybe and there's a generally unpleasant sense so that's the power of feeling

132
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,878
tone the context our attitude our emotions

133
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:40,638
can shift feeling tone in many many kinds of experiences and I'll talk more about that later this week but meanwhile

134
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,960
it's just humbling to see for me how often my experience and actions and

135
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:53,118
other people's actions are shaped by Pleasant or unpleasant in a

136
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:59,440
moment in a sit like we just had in a

137
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:06,839
situation how often do we go through gations move around change things just

138
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:12,400
to avoid an unpleasant interaction person

139
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,240
conflict and what lengths do we go to to

140
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:25,480
get or keep just a little bit more pleasantness it's kind of

141
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:32,800
amazing so there's the how we practiced together with feeling

142
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:40,440
tone today and just to recap that a little bit it's something to Simply

143
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,240
notice it's something to Simply notice and it's kind of it's baked into our

144
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,400
systems it turns out that this movement towards the pleasant and away from the

145
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:59,160
unpleasant is kind of reflexive it's automatic for most sent life single

146
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:05,119
celled organisms move towards sugar and away from a

147
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,319
prod well guess what you and I can be very similar to an amoeba in this way we

148
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:18,440
move towards the pleasant and away from the unpleasant this simple basic movement

149
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:25,319
towards and Away happens at the level of physical movement like from a hot stove

150
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:31,079
and it also happens at a very subtle level of movement in our

151
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:38,280
minds our attention I might suddenly be touched by

152
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:44,720
a really unpleasant memory or thought and away from it or conversely

153
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:52,520
completely hooked by it and building a whole stack of cards a whole huge story

154
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:59,319
about it maybe casting blame outwards or self-recrimination

155
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:06,720
inwards and it's possible instead to just tune into that feeling bring a

156
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:14,040
sense of inquiry a nonverbal question mark oh

157
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:22,800
unpleasant the whole system relaxes so this is sort of explaining

158
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:30,359
another reason Vena can be important not only can it prevent getting lost in

159
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:36,440
thought or help us notice the impact of thought and emotion it can

160
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:43,800
also cut through whatever is extra even fully lost in fantasy or vengeful

161
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:51,440
thinking or poor me the Simplicity of recognizing Pleasant unpleasant or neither can cut

162
00:37:51,440 --> 00:38:01,319
through the thicket of confusing thoughts and clear the air oh it's that simple this is

163
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:08,920
Pleasant I don't have to think about it 50 times during my meditation I can just notice it's

164
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,880
Pleasant simply being with being with feeling tone gives us

165
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:25,079
Alternatives choice space how to respond wisely rather than

166
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:32,319
reflexively it can take us back to that powerful place of being able to

167
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:39,800
observe the river of experience flowing by versus being caught up in

168
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:46,839
it it can take us back to simple mindfulness

169
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:52,720
awareness and while mindful awareness may seem neutral over time it can become

170
00:38:52,720 --> 00:39:00,000
a very pleasant abiding especially especially when we consider the

171
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:11,400
Alternatives so to summarize V feeling tone is a simple way

172
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,640
of parsing experience as pleasant unpleasant or neither Pleasant nor

173
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:23,720
unpleasant it can prevent all kinds of unhelpful stories projections of blame

174
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:30,359
distortions poor me to simply walk it down to that

175
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:35,520
level yes the space between stimulus and

176
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,560
response it can prevent all kinds of unhelpful stories it can cut through the

177
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:49,960
confusion of mental activity fantasy fear-based projection whatever collapses the whole

178
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:56,200
house of cards and noticing VD can clarify how

179
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:03,280
thought thoughts or emotions move through us as processes and that in itself is a form

180
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,319
of Freedom it can begin to help recognize

181
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:14,800
that oh you know thinking about that ice cream 10 15 times in this meditation

182
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,920
seemed pleasant but it's actually kind of causing tension in my body that's

183
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:28,280
unpleasant it can clarify our relationship to our attitude toward what's

184
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,960
happening and that really helps to understand the cause and effect the

185
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:41,839
impact thoughts and emotions have on our system which in itself is a source of

186
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:49,599
wisdom so that's my little wrap about Vena and we have just a few minutes left

187
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:56,480
so I thought rather than talking more um I won't be able to catch them all but if there are a couple of questions people

188
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,200
want to put into the chat I might be able to answer one or two so I'll give

189
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:11,079
it a minute because there's a lag time on my end questions or um comments are

190
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:15,839
welcome in our remaining three minutes

191
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,240
together

192
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:48,040
you're noticing In This Moment what's Pleasant unpleasant or

193
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:55,000
neither oh these are great questions oh so from lraa I hope I'm pronouncing your

194
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:03,280
name right um more about the relationship with the body and the thought process so

195
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:11,240
basically feeling tone applies to any physical sensation it also applies to

196
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:18,000
any thought any emotion so I might feel desire as very

197
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,960
pleasant in a moment and then notice that it's causing tension or contraction

198
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:30,920
in my attention I'm might notice more about um how that desire causes tension in my

199
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,760
shoulders for example so that's a short answer I'm going to be going into this more and

200
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:42,760
building on it actually in the next days is Pleasant versus unpleasant a

201
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:50,040
judgment will sometimes it is so this is a more subtle level it can be an overlay

202
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,240
or a judgment on experience for example if someone touches your shoulder

203
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:01,760
you don't know who you might find it very pleasant if it's an old friend or a lover or very

204
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:09,000
unpleasant if it's a total stranger being presumptuous so it can be contextually oriented the pleasant or

205
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:17,119
the unpleasant and then there are things that pretty much all of us are going to find unpleasant that hot stove for

206
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,800
example so it's sometimes more basic and sometimes it's

207
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:29,519
highly subjective let's

208
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,800
see if we're wired to run away from negative stimuli sometime why do we

209
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:42,480
sometimes dwell on them that is one of the great mysteries of human life

210
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:50,559
um sometimes our minds have the idea that to keep us safe from the negative

211
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:56,800
stimuli we need to figure it out we need to parse it out

212
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:05,440
so it can be helpful it can be helpful to again notice the unpleasantness of

213
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,720
the dwelling and that can help cut through the perseveration or the looping

214
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:18,640
or whatever it is Phil asks what's the difference

215
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,800
between vona and preference

216
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:31,240
so there are layers there and it's a this is a profound question um

217
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:36,280
V is simply the acknowledgement the knowledge that something is Pleasant or

218
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:44,599
unpleasant and a microsc waiter a millisecond waiter most of us have a

219
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:52,520
judgment preferring the pleasant oh pulling away from the unpleasant so wanting and not wanting in the Abid Abid

220
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:58,280
in the Buddhist psychology is a separate layer but it is so close and it's worth

221
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:05,520
noticing for yourself when Pleasant and unpleasant can

222
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:12,160
happen and not have a reaction there are states of meditation

223
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:19,079
there are states of mind that allow equinity to be there where Pleasant and unpleasant can just flow

224
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:27,520
through or when it can um have that little s

225
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:34,520
overlay of wanting and not wanting

226
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:41,000
so I hope that that was helpful for all of you I really

227
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,079
appreciate the questions and this is a profound topic actually those of you who are getting into sort of the amibo level

228
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:54,599
and the reflex level there are ways of relating to this Pleasant unpleasant and

229
00:45:54,599 --> 00:46:01,040
neither that can can give us much more space and a kind of a profound level of

230
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:07,440
equinity if we're willing to be there with it simply and that's building a

231
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:14,000
muscle so that's all we have time for today I will wrap some of these other

232
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,040
questions into the rest of the Dharma talks because they're kind of a little bit

233
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:26,880
cumulative and just to briefly say that noticing Veta helps cut through

234
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:33,839
delusion so maybe if you'd like play with this over the next day and tomorrow

235
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:40,200
we will pick up on the next layer attitudes of mind and

236
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:45,920
heart so thank you all for your practice and may our practice here together

237
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,920
benefit ourselves and everyone around

238
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,800
us joy to be with you SA
