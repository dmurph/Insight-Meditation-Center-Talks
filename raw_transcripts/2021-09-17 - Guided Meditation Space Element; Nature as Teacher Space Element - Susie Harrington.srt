1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,200
good morning welcome once again

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,720
good to see you those who i see and good to see all the good morning welcomes on the

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,920
chat it's really been lovely being here with you connecting with this

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,279
sangha thank you so we're continuing today

5
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:39,120
moving in the elements now to the element of space and yesterday i sort of hinted at this

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,280
way that we're moving uh further and further into

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,840
the ineffable the unseen the

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,600
um [Music] more towards emptiness

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,120
and as i'll say a little bit more about later a little bit more into

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,680
mind into the nature of mind so we'll do a practice

11
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,159
starting to our practice this morning will be a meditation about space

12
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,439
and i want to read you a quote from the suit i've referred to a number of

13
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:30,560
times 62 and this is again the instruction that the buddha is giving his son rahula

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:38,960
and this is what he says rahula develop meditation that is like space

15
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,600
for when you develop meditation that is like space arisen agreeable and disagreeable

16
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,960
contacts contacts will not invade your mind and remain

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,560
just as space is not established anywhere so too rahula develop

18
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,479
meditation that is like space for when you develop meditation that is like space

19
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,239
arisen agreeable and disagreeable context will contacts will not invade

20
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,360
your mind and remain there's a phrase in there i want to

21
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,200
bring your attention to which is he says

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:27,280
just as space is not established anywhere so too rahula develop meditation that is

23
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,879
like space this idea that

24
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:39,120
your your meditation just as space is not established anywhere and that you could

25
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,160
have a meditation that is not established anywhere

26
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:52,000
and that is an interesting idea and it's also a little unnerving for our systems

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,200
that we are we're used to settling on objects

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,560
we're used to landing somewhere recognizing it having our perception

29
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:10,480
name what it is and then having a opinion about it or at least a vedna a

30
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:18,080
feeling tone a pleasant or unpleasant so when we land on space there's this

31
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,280
there can be this uneasiness and an immense neutrality and

32
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,440
i'll speak more later about how useful this neutrality can be and how useful it

33
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,640
is to not be established anywhere but as we move into this meditation i want to

34
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,519
name that you may at times in the meditation sort of be a little like what am i

35
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,959
paying attention to and that's natural because we're shifting

36
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:55,200
instead of paying attention to objects we're paying attention to the space and that can be a little different

37
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,480
so find your comfortable meditation posture

38
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:09,080
and we'll begin as we always do sensing our contact with the ground

39
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,639
letting your self feel the ground through the seat

40
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,400
through your legs or feet

41
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,919
let your attention be aware not only of the pressure and

42
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:51,680
the contact but also of the ground beneath you of the place where you're sitting

43
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,960
let yourself land land here right now

44
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,160
let yourself grow roots

45
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,199
notice the parts of your body that have some tension and see if you can bring some ease or relaxation

46
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:58,520
particularly in the shoulders around the eyes

47
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,080
let the belly soften

48
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:49,319
and let your attention come to the breath and just feel the flow of breath

49
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:58,000
and see if you can find a place a way of connecting with your breath

50
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
that has some sense of ease in it it might be as we

51
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,319
played with yesterday sensing the whole body as you breathe

52
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:34,960
it might be finding letting your attention ride with the breath as it flows in

53
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,199
and then as it releases flowing out

54
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,680
and as you feel yourself established in this place

55
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:41,839
sensing the body feeling the movement of breath

56
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:54,880
no need to be resistant or push away thoughts as they arise simply allowing them to float with

57
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,399
the breath being breathed in and breathed out

58
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,959
and begin to pay more attention on the exhale

59
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,920
follow the exhale

60
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,920
and as you notice the exhale let your attention follow it as it

61
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,959
leaves through your mouth or nose or both follow the exhale

62
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,800
and ride the breath right out to beyond

63
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,920
your lips and nose right into the space there

64
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:59,760
you begin to have a sense of your attention in this space just beyond

65
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,000
your body

66
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,480
and when you inhale you might notice that the attention comes back in

67
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:21,600
and then on the exhale allow it to flow out again into that space

68
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:30,240
and with each exhale perhaps allowing your sense of that space to expand

69
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,839
getting a little bit larger

70
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:58,880
and after a few breaths you might find that you can just allow your attention to rest in the space

71
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:07,760
even as you inhale and then with the exhale allowing your

72
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,800
attention on the space to get a little broader a little bigger

73
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,669
perhaps extending a few feet or more [Music]

74
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,320
beginning even to fill if you're in a room filling the whole room in front of

75
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,040
you if you're outside letting it extend out

76
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,079
maybe as far as first the closest object

77
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:53,839
begin to explore a little what it's like to have your attention on this open empty space

78
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,920
notice if the mind struggles a little bit to land somewhere

79
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:09,600
or notice if there's some stillness or peace we're just calm in the space

80
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,600
don't need to make it a particular way just explore it

81
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,279
and allowing this sense of space to expand as far as

82
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,720
it's comfortable it can keep expanding out and out

83
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,279
go through the walls let your attention go out through the

84
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:49,600
walls beyond the walls if there's walls in front of you to what's beyond that

85
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,959
so that you allow yourself to have the space outside the building

86
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:04,120
and if you're outside allow your attention to expand further and further

87
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,639
the objects are not a problem they too are made of space so just let your attention flow right

88
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,000
through them [Music] not really attending to them in any

89
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,880
detail just on the space

90
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,079
letting it extend maybe as far as the horizon

91
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,920
you might notice that there's moments when there's just sort of a little confusion

92
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,519
and a or even an unease and just notice that

93
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:51,279
or there might be moments where you feel almost like you're falling into the space

94
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,240
and then giving up any effort and just come back and feel your body

95
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,199
landed on the ground sensing the breath

96
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:42,880
then begin to notice just imagine that you could breathe out to your right side

97
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:49,680
so now imagining the exhale coming out the side of your head instead of out the

98
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,880
nose and and letting that exhale take you into the

99
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,720
space to the right side of you

100
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,720
at first it might be a little awkward and your attention will come back in as you inhale

101
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,600
but then begin to allow your attention to rest and with each exhale

102
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,839
allowing a little more a little more expansion in your attention

103
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:38,240
again allowing yourself to sense the whole right side of where you're sitting

104
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:45,360
perhaps in the room or out into the space if you're outside and then going through

105
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,800
the walls if you have walls and beyond

106
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,759
beginning to feel the vastness

107
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,399
this empty open vastness you might even if you can sense your

108
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,519
attention going out into the sky

109
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,399
the limitless sky

110
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,120
and then again dropping all effort noticing if there's any tension that's

111
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,440
accumulated in your body and letting that soften

112
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:48,120
feel yourself anchored here feel the flow of breath

113
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:02,040
and then continue by breathing out behind you

114
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,918
so allowing the exhale to take your attention back behind you

115
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:17,520
and this is sometimes a little more challenging because we're not as aware of the space behind us

116
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,640
but i encourage you to sense it as you do this you'll tend to rest further back

117
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,240
into your back body perhaps softening some

118
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:42,280
see if you can sense the space not just behind your head but behind your back

119
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,000
and letting this sense grow out further

120
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:07,039
perhaps with the exhale or perhaps it just naturally your curiosity

121
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,799
leading you outward behind you

122
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:38,559
let your attention go out behind you through the room through the walls

123
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,960
out into the vaster space as far as is comfortable perhaps it'll be out into

124
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:52,320
the distant sky perhaps just a little beyond what you know

125
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,559
is there

126
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,160
and then again relaxing feeling your body

127
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:27,039
noticing if there's any tension [Music] you don't need to work hard at this

128
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,960
and then letting your breath now go out to the left side

129
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,600
becoming aware of the space to your left

130
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,280
close in first and then in your own time in your own

131
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,559
way expanding out

132
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,400
and then letting that go feeling the body

133
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,600
landed here

134
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,400
and then very gently inviting your attention

135
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,720
to breathe out in all directions

136
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,919
letting your attention get broad and open you might notice that there's a way it

137
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,840
moves but it feels like it moves around and then you might find moments where it

138
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:22,240
just rests in the open space not landing on anything in particular

139
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:29,240
not even landing on any particular point in space

140
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,039
let yourself sense the sky above you through the roof

141
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,960
through the walls the trees

142
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,120
sense the space behind you

143
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:07,440
let yourself rest into all this open space

144
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,919
might feel like resting in a soft cloud

145
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:21,440
might be a little uncomfortable or unfamiliar and that's okay

146
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,799
it only needs to be as big and as broad as you choose

147
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,600
notice in this open space

148
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:01,200
that the objects don't interrupt it that the space even

149
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:08,159
might seem it goes right through the objects the objects can arise

150
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:15,120
we're having a sense of them but they don't disturb the space the space continues

151
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,840
you might notice as you rest in this space

152
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,559
perhaps this space continues right through your own body

153
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:40,320
that this open emptiness also includes right here

154
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:52,799
and in this open empty space there are objects sounds might arise

155
00:23:52,799 --> 00:24:00,559
sensations in the body will happen thoughts float through

156
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,760
sensations of the heart and the emotions

157
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,440
let them all come and go nothing needs to be resisted or pushed

158
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,760
away but allow yourself to stay resting

159
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,960
in the space with this open relaxed attitude of

160
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:30,640
allowing allowing everything to come and to go

161
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:38,600
and you simply rest in this big open space

162
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:54,640
if your attention contracts and comes back

163
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:07,520
that's okay just begin again opening back up to the space

164
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,880
and allowing yourself to rest

165
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:43,630
[Music]

166
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,530
[Music]

167
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:08,480
so the first thing that i'd like to name about space

168
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:16,799
and i won't go into this is in as much detail but that space is often used and avail

169
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,399
for very good reasons as the portal to the nature of the mind

170
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:28,399
to connecting with and understanding this mind itself

171
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,440
so i'll read you one quote from longchampa that is pointing

172
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:42,159
to this he says the mind is like the sky beyond assertion and negation

173
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:49,519
and just as in the sky the clouds take shape and then dissolve with no change to the sky

174
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:55,279
which stays forever pure the nature of the mind is likewise

175
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:01,039
always pure it is primordially enlightened uncreated

176
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:08,159
naturally present ultimate reality long champa is a

177
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,519
12th century teacher in tibet and he traveled in tibet and

178
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,640
bhutan and did some of the most detailed writing and instruction around the

179
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,279
nature of mind

180
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,840
so this quality of space that the

181
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,519
this quality of space that allows room for everything and this

182
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:47,760
is part of what the buddha was pointing to in the specific things of agreeable and disagreeable can come and go

183
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:55,840
and there's space doesn't have a preference it doesn't it as far as we can tell certainly

184
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,640
space doesn't you know something nice something not nice

185
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,480
something difficult something that's wholesome unwholesome

186
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,960
pretty ugly whatever it all comes in

187
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,599
into the space and then when it leaves the space is still there

188
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,359
resting unaffected

189
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,440
it's never harmed by the space

190
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:40,000
and there's an invitation here what is it like to have a meditation a mind like

191
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,839
space where things can come in and be known [Music]

192
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:53,440
and then leave again and that natural reactivity that we get

193
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:59,599
into when we're focused on the objects giving our mind a little break from that an

194
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:05,520
alternative it's not like we're never going to be aware of objects but it's

195
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:12,320
giving ourselves an alternative a way of being with things where we open up

196
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:19,200
sometimes it can be as simple as looking at something you see someone and they're giving and you're in a really difficult

197
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:27,280
situation and you look at them and then you can just broaden and look at the space around them

198
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,960
and all of a sudden there can be a calm a kind of like oh

199
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,040
this is just an arising in space oh perhaps it's a disagreeable one

200
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:47,680
but the space is relaxed and open and we can feel that in us

201
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,440
this sense of space also hopefully in the meditation you touched into it there

202
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,119
can be some aspect of stillness or peacefulness

203
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:05,839
this we can access this like in the meditation we did but there's a very important way we can

204
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:13,520
access this regularly in our meditation in our lives which is watching when things fade so

205
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:20,640
we're paying attention to some object it might be an object of our mind something we're

206
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,839
thinking about or it might be the breath breath is a good example then or

207
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:35,119
something that's happening in our emotions or with another person and if we stay with it

208
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,320
if we don't move our attention and get distracted onto the next object if we

209
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,440
stay with that one there will come a time when that object

210
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,359
of our mind or the obsession with it or the clinging to it is really what i'm

211
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:57,920
speaking to the clinging to it softens

212
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:04,160
and in that fading away there's a gap there's a space when i

213
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,640
said you could feel this in the breath we're very familiar with this at the end of the exhale there's a little gap

214
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:17,040
at the end of an emotion there's a space when a thought fades away there's an

215
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:25,200
opening and all of those are pointing into this aspect of space

216
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,480
into the freedom and ease that's available

217
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,119
between the objects there's lots and lots of space time

218
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:43,520
opening between objects but we're so trained to look

219
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:51,440
at the things that we don't pay attention to the space

220
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,560
and so this element of space is an invitation

221
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,320
to notice all the places where there's gaps

222
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,520
and an invitation to notice that there's ease and freedom even freedom from

223
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,640
clinging in that space

224
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:19,200
and perhaps as i'm talking you can sense that this is

225
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,280
uh very accessible if we turn our attention to it

226
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,440
access to equanimity equanimity has this

227
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:38,079
quality to it where it is allowing everything to come and go it's not that

228
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:45,280
we're indifferent or aloof or sep or not you know not paying attention

229
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:52,160
cut off from it dissociated it's the opposite everything can come and go

230
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:59,920
but we don't grab hold of it and so this quality of paying attention

231
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:07,680
to the space can give us access in a very visceral way

232
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,040
to the quality of equanimity

233
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,760
i think in this day and age when we live not that other

234
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,520
ones were different but just naming that we have so much happening

235
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:31,119
and the ways that things are not as we would wish

236
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:39,280
and if we can open up and see that there's a much bigger

237
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:47,920
container it's like going from here tight small to much bigger open and then whatever

238
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:55,760
arises is a rising in that whether it's the challenges of climate change of loss

239
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,200
in our own lives of the social injustices that we see

240
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,880
it doesn't it's very important it doesn't mean we ignore it and we don't respond

241
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,640
but we're giving ourselves some calm some stability

242
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:19,040
from which then to be able to respond if we're caught in clinging

243
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:24,880
we cannot respond with wisdom we need to

244
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:33,359
open up and give everything the room to come and go without being reactive

245
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:40,960
i know for myself i expand this not only into space but when we get a very expansive sense of space we can also

246
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:48,640
start to have an expansive sense of time and as we crunch down you know with

247
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,960
things that are happening this expanded sense of time and seeing long distance i

248
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,160
mean sometimes for me it really helps to see the rocks and see the expanse

249
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,359
geologically and that is an access

250
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:12,880
for equanimity not for non-responsiveness but for equanimity where this as the

251
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,319
buddha said what's agreeable and disagreeable context will not invade

252
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:25,520
your mind we let things in by clinging to them we're letting them invade our mind

253
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:33,280
and so finding ways to not be invaded a simple practice you can engage in

254
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:39,680
is just look around at the spaces between things you can do it right now

255
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,599
right as i'm talking look around and see what it's like to look at the space

256
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,680
you may have done this practice before not on not uncommon one

257
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:58,880
but it's interesting to try to remember it and notice as you look at the space

258
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:06,079
or another way is even with your eyes open looking around see if you can sense the space behind

259
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:11,440
you and notice what happens is you sense the space behind you

260
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,680
in this case you just let your eyes go soft and have peripheral sort of a sense of

261
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:24,880
peripheral vision and then sense the space behind you and notice what happens if there's a kind of

262
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,119
settling in the mind so for each of us we can find our own doorway what allows

263
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,480
us into this place of non-clinging

264
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,318
i'll end today with a little a short poem

265
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,440
i am beyond limits i contain all things

266
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,480
yet you will not find me unless you look between the rows and its

267
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,240
petals i am the silence between each moment

268
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:12,160
the space the leaf leaves behind as it falls to the ground

269
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:17,440
when the crickets chirp incessantly and the sky is jammed with stars

270
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,520
between the soft brushes of warm breezes you will find me everywhere

271
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,359
stretching out my arms i cannot be found because i never hide

272
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:35,200
yet i beg of you to look for me for it is when our eyes meet

273
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,440
that every dewdrop is filled with love

274
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:48,319
so thank you all so much for being here and spending this week and i

275
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:54,400
hope you take your practice outside and play with the elements

276
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:01,359
and expand that aspect of your practice if you have found this useful

277
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:08,240
and i'd like to dedicate the merit of our practice this week may it be of

278
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:14,640
benefit to each of us and to all we come into contact and to all beings

279
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:21,520
everywhere to whom we are so intimately and inseparably connected

280
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:28,280
may all beings be free thank you
