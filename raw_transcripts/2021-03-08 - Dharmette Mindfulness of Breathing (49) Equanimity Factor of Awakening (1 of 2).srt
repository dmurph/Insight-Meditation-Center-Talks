1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,440
so

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,960
the topic of for

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,920
this talk is the equanimity factor of

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,400
awakening

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,560
and uh it's the seventh of the seven

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,240
factors of awakening and

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,240
over the last week i've been talked to

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,560
her about the earlier factors

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,920
and and we're talking about these seven

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,880
factors of awakening in the context

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,920
of the practice of anapanasati

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,000
mindfulness of breathing

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,360
where we're mindful of the mind that we

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,399
experience starts

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,640
experiencing the mind as we breathe in

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,399
experiencing the mind as we breathe out

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,320
and so we've kind of taken our time

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,960
to understand some of the things we can

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,800
start experiencing

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,840
when we experience the mind the word

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,520
cheetah

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,359
the pali word for mine c-i-t-t-a

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,600
is

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,760
often translated as mind state

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,200
and it's not the mind as a thing

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,799
like the brain is kind of a physical

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,439
thing but rather it's the

28
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,880
way in which we experience our interior

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,280
life

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,799
our mental life as a whole

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,759
and rather than the particular details

32
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,000
of different activities of the mind

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,320
that goes on particular thoughts

34
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,119
feelings

35
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,040
impulses intentions it's the the whole

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,439
of the mind that kind of and how we

37
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,759
experience the whole

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,600
is personal and contextual and

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,799
depending on the different factors of

40
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,960
the mind that come together

41
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,840
and and it sounds a little bit strange

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,079
to say this but the state of the mind

43
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,479
how we experience a state of the mind it

44
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,479
depends on the state of the mind or

45
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,640
how we experience the shape of the mind

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,280
or how we experience this totality of

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,159
the mind

48
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,680
is based a little bit on the state of

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,239
mind or which mental factors are

50
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,720
strongest

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,840
and um but as we open to the mind and

52
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,560
feel it

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,520
it has different characteristics that we

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,400
can feel

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,640
now that takes a lot of stability and

56
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,560
really settled in the practice to start

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,400
feeling this whole mind

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,879
and the mood or the mind that that might

59
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,000
be there

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,640
but as this practice gets strong there

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,440
are seven

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,440
factors that quality qualities

63
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,879
characteristics

64
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,400
that become predominant in the state of

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
the mind that we can experience

66
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,680
different ones of them at different

67
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
times and sometimes kind of all of them

68
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,360
together

69
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
and these are the seven factors of

70
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,040
awakening mindfulness

71
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,720
investigation effort joy tranquility

72
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,519
samadhi and equanimity

73
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,200
and uh these all have different

74
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,560
functions they

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,000
work in different ways as a state of

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,040
mind

77
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,159
mindfulness creates real stability

78
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,680
and uh it's kind of like what there's

79
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,519
that would say differently if the mind

80
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,200
just doesn't waver

81
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,680
it's not agitated and jumping around

82
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,040
when mindfulness becomes a little bit

83
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,680
more

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,200
or awareness becomes a little more a

85
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,959
state that's present

86
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,480
rather than something that we have to

87
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,720
keep renewing but i keep making the

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,080
effort having the intention to be

89
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,920
mindful

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,120
so there's unwaveringness of

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,120
of attention uh investigation

92
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,239
or this ability to see clearly to look

93
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,840
up and see clearly

94
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,480
or intimately experience not by

95
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,000
analyzing it or

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,239
probing but by uh like tuning into the

97
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,400
frequency of the radio and not having

98
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,680
any more static

99
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,840
just really feeling it and sensing more

100
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,040
fully that

101
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,159
what's going on that's of that function

102
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:00,720
is pr

103
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,680
is really important for the process of

104
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,280
liberation they say that's the most

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,000
important

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,640
of the seven factors for liberation

107
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,000
because we have to get things really

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,640
into focus

109
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,040
and then um the effort factor that can

110
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,120
see the difference between wholesome and

111
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,400
wholesome is really key in not being

112
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,519
trapped

113
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,880
by the unwholesome by but finding

114
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,800
a certain kind of healthy escape or

115
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,240
stepping away

116
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,360
from into the wholesome

117
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,240
joy is provides a deep satisfaction a

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,840
deep contentment

119
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,880
a bodily and physically that

120
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,160
is really kind of feels good

121
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,639
and then the last three tranquility

122
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,960
and samadhi and equanimity

123
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,639
are particularly useful

124
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,759
and so the joy factor as well these are

125
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,040
all feelings of

126
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,680
pleasure well-being positive feelings

127
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,360
that we can have

128
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,400
that are tremendous support for practice

129
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,199
in helping free us from some of our

130
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,560
addictive patterns some of

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,520
our attachments attachments to pleasure

132
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,280
attachments to all kinds of things where

133
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,759
we

134
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,120
searching if we think we're searching

135
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,840
for happiness by having more money or

136
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,000
more status or more relationships or

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,840
more

138
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,800
something that's outside of us

139
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,600
and that drive can be addictive at times

140
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,320
and

141
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,479
and um or the strong ways in which fear

142
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,039
operates from us inside of us that

143
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,440
itself is compels us to act certain ways

144
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:39,759
and be

145
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,120
certain ways and anxiety

146
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,160
phobias and there's something about

147
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,520
being settled

148
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,680
in these positive factors these states

149
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,440
of mind of joy

150
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,240
tranquility samadhi and equanimity that

151
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,720
is so

152
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,840
nourishing feels so wholesome that feels

153
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,280
like so such a source of well-being

154
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,120
that it creates a reconditioning factor

155
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,080
it conditions us in new ways rather than

156
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,560
being conditioned by fear or

157
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,680
feeling of lack or feeling of being

158
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,440
deprived or

159
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,160
feeling unsafe for all kinds of ways

160
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,919
which life has kind of conditioned us to

161
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:20,880
be

162
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,440
we're starting to recondition ourselves

163
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,479
and then it becomes

164
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,560
easier to begin letting go of some of

165
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,240
the dysfunctional ways in which we might

166
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,000
be living

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,919
and so rather than only relying on

168
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,000
mindfulness seeing clearly recognizing

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,360
what's happening

170
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,639
to free us from some of our conditioning

171
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,600
which is very hard to only rely on

172
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,039
mindfulness

173
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,800
but to really have the mindfulness

174
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,440
support this process of settling and

175
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,479
stability and growth in the dharma to

176
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,360
begin

177
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,599
eventually and eventually is an

178
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,120
important word here so we don't get

179
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,199
impatient

180
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,639
start kind of getting nourished

181
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,639
by these wholesome qualities and way of

182
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,080
being

183
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,720
and the last of these is equanimity and

184
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,680
equanimity

185
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,960
um for many people who are unfamiliar

186
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,599
with this

187
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,000
idea and buddhism will think that

188
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,160
equanimity is kind of maybe aloof or

189
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,120
kind of dry

190
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,479
or kind of not really relevant for

191
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,240
having a good time in life and uh

192
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,160
and maybe even not relevant for making

193
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
ourselves safe in this world

194
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,840
if we're is equanimist how do we make

195
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,599
ourselves safe

196
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,240
the um

197
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,080
and um but

198
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
uh and i think when i was before i

199
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,479
became a buddhist practitioner

200
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,360
i don't think i had any i used the word

201
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,759
equanimity in any kind of way

202
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,680
in my vocabulary i probably knew what it

203
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,520
meant some somewhat

204
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,280
but it had no relevance for how i lived

205
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,039
my life or how i talked about thought

206
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,400
about myself

207
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,759
but certainly with practice and

208
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,080
meditation equanimity became

209
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,680
has become a more and more important

210
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,599
quality something that i recognize and

211
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,199
appreciate

212
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,520
it kind of as a state there's this kind

213
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,599
of feeling that courses through my whole

214
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,720
body

215
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,160
um a kind of stability and clarity and

216
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,680
openness and

217
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,520
and the kind of a freedom that comes

218
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,960
with equanimity

219
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,319
and it's considered to be one of the

220
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,160
most sublime

221
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,280
uh states of being that a person can

222
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,560
experience

223
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,440
it's um kind of kind of considered the

224
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,199
crown jewel of the seven factors of

225
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,959
awakening which themselves are the crown

226
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,120
jewels

227
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,240
so you know it's that that's

228
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,800
just letting you know that if you're

229
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,680
practicing

230
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,919
develops over time maybe you'll start

231
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,959
feeling how

232
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,519
special this equity manufacturer is and

233
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,160
the rich emotional aspect it's not

234
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,120
indifference or aloofness or dryness

235
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,160
and the equanimity factor

236
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,600
it worked it belongs to a family of

237
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,279
concepts and states that

238
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,560
is championed by buddhism and one of

239
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,839
them is this

240
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,360
equanimity which is upeka in

241
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,200
pali another one is a mouthful of

242
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,279
words that means literally something

243
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,120
like etymology of it

244
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,720
standing in the middle of it all

245
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,040
standing in the middle of this

246
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,720
and that's often seen as a sense of

247
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,959
balance and then there's a word

248
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,519
sama which maybe is cognitively related

249
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,320
to our word same

250
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,160
i'm not sure about this how these

251
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,360
languages

252
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,720
connect um they're distant relatives of

253
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,240
each other english and

254
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,600
and pali and some uh

255
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,160
can mean can mean something like even it

256
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,360
can mean also like light

257
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,560
like the same but even

258
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,240
balanced also but an evenness of mind

259
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,560
and it's related to some is related to

260
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,519
words samana

261
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:03,519
s-a-m-e-n-a which

262
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,720
means either impartiality or sometimes

263
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,879
it's

264
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,480
translated as justice so impartiality

265
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:12,800
that

266
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,120
uh like the impartial justice the

267
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,040
impartial judging of things

268
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,320
it's considered a really high ideal and

269
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,839
to treat people in a certain

270
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,079
impartiality doesn't mean indifference

271
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,560
it means that we treat everyone kind of

272
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,839
equally and it's kind of

273
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,120
the equal so it's some as equal or same

274
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,000
or sameness so an evenness of mind an

275
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,839
impartiality of mind

276
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,399
a balance of heart and mind balance of

277
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,760
body and mind

278
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,440
and equanimity and

279
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,800
for now i will just

280
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,560
say briefly a little bit about

281
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,399
equanimity and then pick up this topic

282
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,760
tomorrow

283
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,519
and um because it's so important

284
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,040
and the word for equanimity upeka

285
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,160
upe kkha

286
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,720
is the etymology of the word is actually

287
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,399
quite useful here

288
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,160
it literally means something to have it

289
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,399
like to have an overview

290
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,720
to have the bird's eye view of what's

291
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
happening

292
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,320
so it involves a kind of wisdom that

293
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,959
comes from seeing how things are

294
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,760
so it's a kind of a wisdom factor it's

295
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,880
not just something that

296
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,240
arises because the quality

297
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,440
of some kind of inner balance is strong

298
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,839
but rather it also comes from the

299
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,839
strength of mindfulness

300
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,480
investigation all these other factors

301
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,600
and then being able to

302
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,079
not be pulled for against things not

303
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,040
quickly become impartial not quickly be

304
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,200
reactive to experience but have a

305
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,320
stability

306
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,040
that allows us to have the overview and

307
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,880
wisdom operates

308
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,279
wisdom can see that oh that's being

309
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,959
pulled into things i don't need to do

310
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,760
that

311
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,240
that's my anger i don't have to get pick

312
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,880
it up and get involved

313
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,760
that's pain i've been i know about pain

314
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,480
i've

315
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,800
meditated with pain for a long time and

316
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,560
i know i'm better off

317
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,279
not getting pulled into its orbit and

318
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,959
preoccupied by it or

319
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,440
reactive to it and so there's a little

320
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,120
bit of wisdom operating with this

321
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,160
overview

322
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,040
having the big picture of how it works

323
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,399
and um

324
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,399
so um so it belongs to the

325
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,519
the uh aspect of mindfulness

326
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,440
where we can begin observing what's

327
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,120
going on it's a little bit like it's a

328
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,560
little bit like

329
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,160
you know stepping back and having the

330
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,120
big picture or being up in a

331
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,160
hilltop maybe looking down or the

332
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,760
experience that i had this wonderful

333
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,079
experience that was very

334
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,720
valuable for me many years ago was a

335
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,079
second year in college

336
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,160
first time i was living with the college

337
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,600
roommates and

338
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,320
little apartment and the little

339
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,360
apartment had a

340
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,800
deck out the living room and one day i

341
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,240
was out somehow i was out in the deck

342
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,480
with living room sliding door closed

343
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,320
and two of my roommates were having an

344
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,760
animated i think a friendly enough

345
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,519
animated conversation

346
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,360
in the living room and i couldn't hear

347
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,279
anything they were saying

348
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,440
but i could see the animated way they

349
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,480
were

350
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,959
and i could feel how i was kind of

351
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,399
delighted seeing them

352
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,240
but i could feel how i wasn't being

353
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,680
pulled around by what they were saying

354
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,800
and how they were i wasn't getting

355
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,519
pulled in

356
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,600
or reactive to it i was just kind of

357
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,040
sitting peacefully

358
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,000
delightfully just watching in a kind of

359
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,680
