1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:09,280
so hello everyone and welcome to the meditation and one of the

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,960
characteristics of mindfulness meditation that's meant to be a characteristic is

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:24,039
Simplicity and now we're I think on the 19th part of this 25p part introduction

4
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:32,160
to mindfulness meditation that's a lot of instructions and lent itself to the idea that it's complicated a lot to

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,480
remember but uh one way of understanding this instructions is that

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:46,079
um you've come into a new park it's a large Park and you never been to it

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,600
before and you have a guide and the guide takes you to the different parts

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,000
of the park and so you know where they are you know what they are you know how to relate to each part part part of the

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,240
park and so next time you go you go alone and now you're not lost you're not

10
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,840
searching for the way you just know okay now I'm here now I'm here now I'm here

11
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:20,320
and so now it's got become very simple each part of the park is a simple thing to be in because you're well familiar

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,560
with the territory so there's a lot of instructions but it's kind of like just

13
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:34,680
laying out the map of the territory and the mindfulness is meant to be very

14
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,840
simple and um so each of the different parts come into focus at different times

15
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,360
when you're in different parts of the your inner Your Inner

16
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:55,119
Park and um so part of that Simplicity is this radically simple just

17
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,880
knowing what the experience is and that's how we started this

18
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,799
uh series at the first very first uh teaching the Simplicity of just knowing

19
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,879
what is happening but now you know can hopefully recognize more of what's happening the richness the different

20
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,760
components of what's happening and as you're kind of have understand the the

21
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:26,120
the the ecosystem of the present moment it's easier to be aware simply just know

22
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,519
it oh this is what happening know it now there's a thought thought just know the

23
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:39,000
thought and in The Knowing there is some freedom in The Knowing there's some peace in the knowing there's some way of

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,879
not being caught in the experience now I just know a

25
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,360
thought being present for the thought now I notice that the thought is

26
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,720
connected to some emotion knowing the emotion look at that there's an emotion

27
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,319
as opposed to oh oh no there I'm thinking again oh no not that emotion

28
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,879
just an emotion and then you're aware with the emotion then because you know the

29
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:13,159
territory it becomes kind of second nature to notice oh this is a physical part of it this is where it is in the

30
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:20,959
body and there might be a little bit of guidance you give yourself because you know the territory but um it's the

31
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:28,480
guidance just to notice where is the most appropriate Place uh to offer your attention now

32
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:37,080
what's the most obvious place and keeping the awareness very very simple and one of the ways to keep it

33
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:44,560
simple is to uh one of the kind of the toolbox of Simplicity if is mental

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,879
noting just a very quietly name note label the experience you're having then

35
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,920
the actual label is not that important what's important is the kind of deeper

36
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,319
acknowledgment that naming provides if someone you know you haven't seen for

37
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:09,439
a long time and they say hello to you with your name then you know they've remembered you and they've acknowledged

38
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:17,079
you more fully it feels good if you're in a room with a lot of people um and uh someone's going around

39
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:23,440
saying hello to everyone and they see you and for a moment there's a glimmer of delight in their eyes and they come

40
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,440
to shake your hand and as they shake your hand their hand goes limp and they're already looking over to the next

41
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,639
person person and it feels kind of deflating like oh as the person connects

42
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,759
with me I'm not they're not really here for me with mindfulness Simplicity of mindfulness is kind of

43
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:46,360
like to know it to acknowledge it and name it so it's really acknowledged and

44
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,880
we step closer to it and so that so the naming if we do it is not the end of a

45
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,039
process it's not like a checklist It's A Gentle Beginning of an opening to The

46
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:05,199
Experience more fully and um so we're

47
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:15,479
thinking it can be very useful to name the thought label it and um and uh and so it can be just

48
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:21,800
thinking it could be planning it could be remembering it could be fantasy it

49
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,199
could be storytelling the idea is not to spend a lot of time searching for the right

50
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:35,160
label but to name it with a Simplicity of

51
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,400
mind we're using a thought the word thinking for example is

52
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,000
a in in the mind is kind of a thought to better acknowledge that we're

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,479
thinking so the thinking relaxes so we're not so caught in it and we're

54
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:59,160
using this thought that's a very simple recognition ideally from a calm maybe

55
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:07,199
deep de peaceful place calmly peaceful and then this is what it is

56
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,039
sometimes it's helpful to be more specific what it is not just thinking uh something about a fuller acknowledgement

57
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:19,720
to clear clearly recognize it's helpful so as we do this meditation

58
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:28,120
we'll do it mostly quiet and as you begin to think turn your attention

59
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,440
and look your thoughts right in the eye with no idea that it's wrong to

60
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,599
think or you shouldn't be thinking just turn to it and like I see

61
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:44,560
you I see you planning but not I see you like your

62
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,840
problem but uh I see you my friend I see you

63
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:57,080
planning but not that you're participating in the planning but you're stepping back and just peacefully calmly

64
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,800
ah I see you planning and then as you when you say planning

65
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,919
then unless the planning goes away right away just uh do spend three breaths just

66
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:16,960
opening to the whole experience of planning and this is where as you open to it you might notice the words that

67
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,440
it's images that it's the emotions the physicality of it you might notice by

68
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,160
the third breath there's someplace you can relax and let go and then Begin Again

69
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,960
with your breathing so that's the instructions main instruction is just look think whatever thoughts you have

70
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:43,400
right in the eye ackowledge it's there I see you with a label planning

71
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,199
remembering and um and see if you can make that really simple

72
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:57,919
where The Treasure of meditation is not found can we say it in

73
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,319
the meditation that you're trying to to do but the treasure is found in the

74
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:10,560
knowing in the how you know whatever is happening so today uh I'm going to just let the rest

75
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,800
of the meditation be silent and you can kind of settle in the way you want and

76
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,840
and hopefully do this meditation uh instructions as it works for you and

77
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,159
fits

78

for

107
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,080
in the last few minutes of this quiet part of the

108
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:03,120
meditation experiment or discover cover maybe the quietest

109
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:10,679
way of naming acknowledging being aware of

110
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,720
thinking without being without

111
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,679
participating in what you're thinking

112
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
about

113
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

114
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
for

115
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

116
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:07,520
and now as we come to the end of the

117
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:16,760
meditation open your attention more widely to take in your whole body your

118
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:23,640
whole being here and in some simple

119
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,158
way let yourself tell yourself I see

120
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:37,679
you in a way that you're saying I'm here with you here to support you care for

121
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,559
you saying this to

122
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:53,440
yourself where the emphasis is to really acknowledge and see in a simple way with

123
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:04,799
kindness and then opening your awareness more

124
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:12,320
widely but not leaving yourself out kind of like you're part of a

125
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,399
whole and now gaze upon some form of the

126
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:25,039
community that is around you in the building you're in and the

127
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:31,559
neighborhood you're in the town you're in some sense of

128
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:35,039
broader sense of

129
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:42,360
community and acknowledge not exactly yourself not ex

130
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:48,679
exactly them but acknowledge this is a community this is

131
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:54,120
a somewhat related set of human beings that

132
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:01,039
contribute to a whole a community a neighborhood a

133
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,240
town and look upon all of you together in

134
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,840
kindness recognizing this is a

135
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:21,519
community however whatever challenges it might be within it it's

136
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:29,440
still a whole of sorts gazing upon it kindly recognizing it

137
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:39,720
and expanding it beyond your neighborhood out into the whole world all people

138
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:45,679
everywhere you are part of this wider kinship of

139
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:53,440
humans Kindred Spirits kin in some way or

140
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:59,440
other and there's a hole often it's very divided with

141
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:07,559
antagonism and Wars but for a moment to acknowledge we

142
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:17,200
are a whole we are also a community of Kindred Spirits beating Hearts breathing

143
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,320
lungs and wishing all of ourselves well the whole

144
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:36,600
community may this wider Circles of community be

145
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:45,760
happy May these wider Circles of community that I'm part of be

146
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:53,919
safe may these wider Circles of community be

147
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,360
peaceful and may this Wider Circle of community be

148
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:08,159
free free of Oppression free of poverty free of

149
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,840
attachment may all beings everywhere be

150
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:25,640
[Music]

151
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
happy

152
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,399
thank [Music]

153
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
you

154
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,960
so now we continue now with the fourth talk on mindfulness of

155
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,799
thinking and thinking is an important part of being a human being and it's

156
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:58,799
best not to be in an antagonistic relationship though it's I know that for

157
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:05,279
many people their thinking is often a challenge uh get pulled into thoughts

158
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:10,440
which would you rather not have and

159
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:17,799
um and what keeps thoughts going is the interest that something in

160
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:23,639
our system has for them the attachments to certain things

161
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:30,320
the uh resistance or the being bothered by things we're in a relationship with

162
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:36,600
our thoughts that is feeding them it's keeping them going and one of the things

163
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:42,960
we can learn in meditation is if we if we are aware of them directly

164
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,519
fully but we're not feeding them sometimes they go away really quickly

165
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:54,639
and some people get confused in meditation when they do mindfulness how quickly their thoughts will disappear if

166
00:32:54,639 --> 00:33:01,279
they just note them and see them and recognize them and it's because when with the full with

167
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:08,519
when the attention itself is not reactive then we're not in a relationship that's

168
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:15,120
actively giving the food of attention to the thoughts and so this is where even

169
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,559
if we have uh if we really dislike our thoughts and really troubled by them don't want to be involved in

170
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:27,639
them all that attention and not wanting and being aversive to them that is

171
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:33,679
actually fueling the thoughts more it's like giving it more attention to continue or not may may not the

172
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,760
particular content of the thoughts but the the tendency of thinking is just

173
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:46,240
getting reinforced and so sooner or later it's a very valuable to learn the art of not

174
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:54,200
being bothered by your thoughts not being troubled by even the most you know ugly thoughts a person can

175
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,880
have just just step back and know it from a place that's not entangled or

176
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:07,559
caught in it and for some people that Equanimity that disengagement from

177
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:12,800
thoughts while we see them is supported by a simple mental

178
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,878
noting and uh labeling and some people will only use

179
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:24,158
this technique of labeling for their thinking because it really helps them to

180
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,398
step away and acknowledge and not be entangled in it but to do that you have to have some

181
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:37,040
sense to Discovery what it's like to know without being attached without leaning into or pulling away or being

182
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:44,320
reactive to it and one way one thing that supports that is uh to listen to if you're using

183
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,398
a word in the mind of melting like your voice says thinking or remembering or

184
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:56,599
planning um is to listen to how that is being said in the mind and it might be

185
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,680
that you're not so uh equanimous about it after all by

186
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,280
the tone of The Voice or the strength by which you're saying it some way or other

187
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,880
maybe if you um don't you know if you don't like it uh maybe you're a versive

188
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:19,400
to it the the inner voice might might say you know you know planning you know

189
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,599
like there's a little bit of you know aversion in The Voice or if you're

190
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:30,320
having some wonderful fantasy and you really enjoy it maybe the mental

191
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:39,240
note has the way you say it has a sense of indulging or or or um uh

192
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:47,280
enjoying like you might say oh fantasy oh that's so good kind of more like that

193
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:55,720
and you can find you know the relationship we have and find out how to know without

194
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,839
being an active relationship with it just letting it be just seeing it for what it

195
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:08,000
is of course this is not always easy and um but you can always be

196
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,280
mindfulness even when you're not doing it this kind of way if you're be being

197
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:21,400
mindful if you simply recognize how it actually is so one of the little phrases another

198
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:27,800
thought label that can be helpful for some of us sometimes is actually to say

199
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:34,520
um this is how it is now whatever is happening recogn oh this is how it is

200
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:39,560
now it's just this how it is now um and whatever it might be if you're

201
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:46,760
distracted if you're caught up in your thoughts if you're spinning if you're reactive oh so this is how it is now and

202
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:53,480
this movement this is how it is now is kind meant to be kind of a movement of kind of relaxing stepping back opening

203
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,200
up acknowledging oh without this is how it is without being for or against it

204
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:07,200
just honest recognition so we can always do oh so this is how it is now and hopefully with

205
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,720
that kind of understanding it protects us a little bit from the idea that uh

206
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,920
meditation is not going well we're failing the very moment you just

207
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,119
recognize how it actually is for you and one of the great labels that I've used

208
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:30,720
for myself when it just everything was so complicated is I say oh this is chaos

209
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:37,280
chaos right now and um and and that just creates this great big kind of space for

210
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:44,079
just the whole catastrophe but with a mindful way chaos and then as I stay

211
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:50,240
present for that then it kind of I get closer I see oh there's a lot of churning in the chest there's a lot of

212
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,599
fast thoughts and then it's coming closer into knowing something a little more

213
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:02,800
particular and um so this uh so as we do this was thinking oh this is planning

214
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,040
this is fantasy okay and then there's space to

215
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:15,200
get see it better and one of the things we can see is uh the glue that between

216
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:23,240
us and the thinking the pull the gravitational pull the stickiness that's there and that's valuable to know too oh

217
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:28,319
look those thoughts are sticky or I'm sticky with it I'm attached to it I'm

218
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:35,800
leaning into them I'm there seems to be a very strong bond between the thoughts in me thoughts in

219
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,920
the mind no wonder I can't let go because I can feel so it isn't just kind

220
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:47,440
of idea of knowing you're attached but feeling the sensations of stickiness or

221
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,560
strong magnetic pull or or um even the

222
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:59,200
sense of that oh we're really like stuck together here now and so rather than being upset with that

223
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:07,680
again never upset just oh look at that this is stickiness this is the glue that keeps the thoughts going and so you now

224
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:13,400
you're seeing a different part of the experience oh this is how it is this is how it

225
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,480
is so I want to repeat what I said in the beginning of the guided meditation

226
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:26,079
for those of you who might not hear that um all the instructions we give in

227
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:32,119
mindful meditation might seem like a lot to remember a lot to do and very

228
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:38,000
complicated it's meant to be simple and uh what I'm trying to do in

229
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:45,200
this series of in instructions is to describe the territory that you'll of your inner

230
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:52,599
experience so that you know how to recognize it that it's there what's happening and know how to how to be

231
00:39:52,599 --> 00:40:00,280
mindful of what you're recognizing of what's Happening so that it's not just one big buzzing confused kind of sense

232
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:07,920
of suffering or challenge you start seeing that oh in fact there's different parts of it and I'd like to propose the

233
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:15,359
simile of a park that uh you know maybe you can approach your inner Life as a

234
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,560
Nature Park a natural Preserve or something which in some ways we

235
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,040
are and um and that you've never been in this park before and a nature guide

236
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:32,599
brings BR you in for the first time and takes you around and shows you all the parts of the park the paths the The

237
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:38,319
Groves of trees the ponds the whatever it is it shows you around and it turns

238
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:43,960
out that um you know you don't exactly remember everything in the moment but

239
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,960
when you go in by yourself you kind oh yeah this is where I'm now I'm by the pond or this is by The Grove this is by

240
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,480
the meadow and this is you know where the path goes or and you know you feel

241
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:02,599
confident you know the way way out um because you you've been told all the pieces of it so that's a little bit what

242
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:08,160
I'm trying to do here is to show you the territory of Your Inner Park as you end

243
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,839
up in it and then you learn to when you come to the different places you recognize oh this is how it is now this

244
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:21,520
is how it is here and um and as this recognition this opening this centering

245
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:28,520
on the experience maybe there can be something inside of you can relax something is

246
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:34,000
seen something is known something is not struggled with it's it's just recognized

247
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:42,880
instead of struggle ah this is fear ah this is my my irritation ah this

248
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:49,680
this is how it is now naming it seeing it I see you so the same thing we're

249
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:55,160
thinking and thinking is a made up of many component parts it's like a whole

250
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:02,319
part of the park that is is different paths different pieces that come together to make the whole and so at

251
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:10,160
different times now you might notice uh these are thoughts I'm thinking in words these are images I'm

252
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,720
think thinking I'm in images this is um fast thoughts this is slow thoughts this

253
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:23,920
is active thoughts now my thoughts seem angry now they're quiet and calm now they're harsh

254
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,480
now they're now they're this way now they're connected to grief now

255
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:38,160
they're connected to enthusiasm and an wonderful anticipation and and this is what the

256
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:45,440
emotion is like and this is where the source arm of thinking so this is not analysis or thinking or searching to

257
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:52,680
understand but it's just over time as you get more and more familiar with the inner par you can acknowledge oh this is

258
00:42:52,680 --> 00:43:01,760
what's happening now now I see the component parts this is what's happening and um and finally as a way of

259
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:09,520
not making it complicated kind of a protection from that uh I of I suggest that people use

260
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:16,880
breathing as a default just come back to the breathing and if you spend some time recognizing thinking the parts of

261
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:23,040
thinking you might kind of use the the ref the the standard of about uh the

262
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:29,559
three breath Journey with everything for about three breaths recognize your thinking maybe not

263
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:36,800
thinking and then open to it and be present and breathe with the experience of thinking for three breaths and then

264
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:44,480
begin the breathing or if the breath feels like there's a lot of tension in the body notice out tension and just be

265
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:51,200
with that for three breaths and then back to the breathing for however long it works so that you don't get pulled

266
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:56,480
into or entangled in relationship with what you know and it's very easy easy to

267
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,119
get caught in that entanglement with things without knowing you are and so

268
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:08,160
just like a short time three breaths and then back to the breathing so everything is respected

269
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,920
carefully and well but you don't have to spend a lot of time with it you might

270
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,079
come back to your breathing for a while three breaths and then you might the way you're thinking might still be prominent

271
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:25,559
so you might know it again and then back to breathing that calm going back to the

272
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:32,359
breathing centering and then maybe going back to your thoughts thinking this is how it

273
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:38,559
is so um so as you go through your day

274
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:45,200
today and you notice that you're thinking which I hope you do now you're little more familiar with the territory

275
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:51,760
in the way experiment again with uh how simply

276
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,520
you can know your thinking and as you know

277
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:04,599
it what is your relationship to it is it simple or are you in fact leaning into

278
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:11,280
it or bothered by it and if you are just say oh this is how it is

279
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:19,520
now so thank you very much so we have one day um more to do

280
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:25,359
thinking
