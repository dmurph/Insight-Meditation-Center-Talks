1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:07,440
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,639
and I feel fortunate to be able to offer

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:22,480
uh you some of the share some of the

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,359
wonderfulness of uh this practice that I've been doing for so

5
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:35,760
long And one of the things that's quite wonderful

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:44,680
is developing the capacity to do next to nothing in

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:51,239
meditation So not try to attain anything or make something

8
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,360
happen except to be aware to be

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:04,080
present to be here And uh sometimes it's pretty clear in

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:13,439
meditation that the mind wants to be any anywhere but here Um way the distracting mind wanders

11
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,920
off in all kinds of directions and ways or it's clear that

12
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:26,000
the that the mind is aversive to here doesn't want to

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,400
be with what's happening here and now But to be able to be here with our

14
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,079
present moment experience and neither for or

15
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:44,720
against neither avoiding or you know a certain way you know

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:53,479
diving in to penetrate it or to but simply to be still

17
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,439
And as we're still to

18
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:10,600
notice or to be more simple simply to watch the unfolding of experience

19
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,480
And one of the purposes for samadei for developing concentration is to have the stability

20
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:30,000
to have the settleness uh to just stay here with the

21
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,120
experience and so much learning happens when you just sit and

22
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:43,640
watch An example that I heard many years ago is if a nature

23
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:51,319
photographer wants to take pictures on the vast plains of

24
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:58,440
Africa Uh to go running all over the plains looking for the animals makes it

25
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,440
difficult But if the person sits still quiet by the watering hole and

26
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,319
waits everything comes for the water All the animals

27
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:16,519
come So if we can sit sit still at the watering hole of the

28
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:23,959
dharma and watch the comingings and goings of sensations

29
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:29,120
experiences thoughts even feelings in a certain kind

30
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,799
of way And the heart of seeing the coming

31
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:43,640
and going kind of the key to it is to uh notice how the

32
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,080
perception the way we perceive the present moment is constantly

33
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,720
shifting Even if something on the surface seems like it's

34
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:02,840
constant it's not going away Like right now I can feel my hand on my

35
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,000
knee and you know as long as I rest my hand there that's sensations are going

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,959
to be there But if I really pay careful attention to those

37
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,799
sensations I can see how my perception of it shifts and changes to different parts of the

38
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:25,360
palm then to thinking about what I'm going to say here to all of you and then

39
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,400
looking at the screen and your names and the greetings and then back to my palm

40
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,720
and then it's my finger and then it's my thumb and then it's the

41
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,199
the you know the base of my palm and there was more pressure So the

42
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,880
perception changes all the time The idea of the hand on the knee is kind of

43
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:54,240
constant that kind of points to something's not changing So it gives the idea that there's constancy but this is

44
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,919
where if we can separate out the sensation from the concept of

45
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:08,800
it just the sensation just the perception so to be still and do nothing

46
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,160
more than to watch So we'll enter into that world

47
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,360
So to gently close your eyes

48
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,680
and and to enter into your

49
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:36,720
posture no matter what posture you're in can you adjust it a bit twist your body

50
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,400
sway side to side do something that gently opens your

51
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:50,320
chest maybe creates a little bit of alertness

52
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:57,240
in the back of your neck and the spine Maybe lifting

53
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,800
the back of the head up or tipping the chin

54
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,919
down Maybe there's ever so slight way that you

55
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,880
could accentuate the curve in the lower back or straighten the curve in lower

56
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:22,000
back Whichever way just ever so slightly that gives the lower back a feeling of

57
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,360
being more alert more

58
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:40,919
enlivened and feeling within a with a intentional

59
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:49,680
posture Feeling whatever sense of being enlivened you are in your

60
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:58,120
posture The sense of

61
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:05,479
living vitality Whatever degree is there Even if you're tired or feeling

62
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:12,120
weak to feel where in your body there's a sense of vitality

63
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,759
Even if you feel weak to have those sensations means you're

64
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,960
alive It's part of life coursing through

65
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:34,560
you and into that aliveness of your body your

66
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:44,960
posture in a way that's right for you nice for you Take a few long slow deep

67
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,520
breaths And as you exhale

68
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:57,720
settle into the grounding place deep in your

69
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,280
belly Deep with the weight of your belly your torso

70
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:20,360
settles The movement of breathing in and breathing out with the exhale

71
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,680
settles into a place of stillness deep within

72
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,360
Then to let your breathing return to

73
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:50,080
normal And as you exhale to soften relax your

74
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,240
body And to relax Exhale all the way to the end of the

75
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,279
exhale as a movement of settling into a

76
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,519
stillness A

77
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:23,000
settleness however brief it is

78
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,000
As you come to the end of the

79
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:50,079
exhale letting your thoughts thinking become

80
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:03,320
quieter letting your thoughts drift away Maybe letting them

81
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,360
go at the end of the exhale

82
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,839
And then feeling or imagining deep within there's a still

83
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,839
point

84
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:08,440
Stay close to that still point Do it Almost like it's

85
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:15,360
the quiet place within from

86
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:21,120
which you notice you watch all the change that

87
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:28,279
occurs Staying in the river of changing

88
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:35,839
sensations changing perceptions Even if something remains

89
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:42,120
and doesn't change stay

90
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,600
open Stay quiet and still observing what is

91
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,560
changing in your direct experience

92
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,279
No need to think about anything No need for thoughts to linger

93
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:59,839
anywhere Instead allow yourself to

94
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:06,519
watch the river of change The river of changing

95
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:09,519
perceptions

96
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:19,399
sensations how thinking and thoughts come and go

97
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,519
The way you can watch thinking if you don't get pulled into

98
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,880
the content just a phenomena of

99
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:42,519
thinking It's constantly shifting and changing with all the other changes

100
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,799
No need to think about anything Thinking about something is

101
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,360
doing something

102
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,720
Rest in the stillness from which you

103
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,440
can peacefully

104
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:08,240
observe all the change changing

105
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:20,960
perceptions Not even needing to identify what you're experiencing to even know what it is

106
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:30,000
Except that it's changing shifting appearing

107
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,200
disappearing flowing

108
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:35,159
And as we come to the end of the sitting

109
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,559
noticing to what degree any degree at

110
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:50,960
all you can find inside of you a way in which you're doing

111
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:58,360
nothing except watching the change changing

112
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:05,440
flow like a large boulder in a river where the current of the water

113
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:14,720
just flows by Be still and watch the flow the river of

114
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:30,320
change So that even your heart your heart

115
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,679
center is unstuck

116
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,600
Even so your capacity for a tender care

117
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:54,720
or kindness is part of the

118
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:02,520
flow part of the river of change A kind of love that's

119
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:09,399
actually stronger The less it's held in

120
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:14,799
check the more it flows and

121
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:29,320
openly and letting your goodwill flow outward into the world

122
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,399
Almost as if the more it flows outwards and spreads your heart just opens and opens

123
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,440
and opens outward into the

124
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:56,360
world and carried on the flow of your goodwill

125
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:06,399
Let there be the wishes May all beings be

126
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:12,720
happy May all beings be

127
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,039
safe May all beings be

128
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:26,440
peaceful May all beings be free

130

[Music]

131
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,600
Thank you

132
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,960
So hello and welcome to this series on

133
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:18,159
insight and um so today I'm talking about the fourth category of insight

134
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:26,399
that of the five different category major categories and um so the first is

135
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:34,480
personal insight that's unique to each individual The second is um insight into

136
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,880
way of seeing clearly that in any given moment there are two things There's

137
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,640
experience we have and the knowing of it the recognition of it And um so the

138
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,760
experience itself in the most fundamental basic way is the the way

139
00:31:51,760 --> 00:32:00,679
it's experienced through the sense doors Um and um and so that sensing and

140
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:08,320
feeling and then knowing recognizing what that is Uh so that begins to tease things

141
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,399
apart that are often entangled and that tangle that we live

142
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:22,000
in of per what we call generally sometimes called perception is um there's a third element

143
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:30,880
that makes it really sticky or more a solid ball of knots is um the self who

144
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:39,720
perceives the self that's experiencing things So if I

145
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:47,159
um see a advertisement for the next greatest

146
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:52,430
revolutionary technological device and um and

147
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:57,760
[Music] uh and it just kind of appears on maybe

148
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:04,320
the screen and a commercial and that just comes and goes

149
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,039
And it's actually moving shifting changing scenery as they talk about this new device with great

150
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:16,360
ways And um but I immediately kind of lock in to the the

151
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,600
device and I'm the one who's hearing it I would like to have it If I could have

152
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:27,519
this device then I'll be the most tech advanced person on my block and I'll be

153
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,039
have a lot of people will admire me and it'll be really great And so there's

154
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:39,120
such a big knot of desires and ideas and ideas of self and the perceiver and what

155
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:46,960
the perceiver wants that's comes together almost simultaneous with seeing the device

156
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,279
hearing it being talked about And so the idea that simply seeing oh there's a

157
00:33:53,279 --> 00:34:00,159
there's a new tech device I'm seeing it in front of me It's it's shifting and changing angles and it's my knowing of

158
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:06,799
it There's hearing the voice of the person saying talking about it There's

159
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:14,679
hearing and there's knowing that I'm hearing There's knowing there's sounds of speaking Um it's the the world gets

160
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:21,919
simplified can be simplified Uh so we're not caught up in the concepts the ideas the me that's

161
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:30,240
part of it where it all becomes one big tangle and uh and so to relax So part of

162
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,599
insight as we go deeper and deeper kind of like we're going deeper in the Janna

163
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:43,679
and we're deeper in deep concentrated states there's a stilling and a quieting and a simplifying of what the mind is

164
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,520
about and what we're doing and caught up in a calmer state and at some point uh

165
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:55,040
we don't not adding self and desires and wishes on top of our experience Each

166
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,079
thing is seen in its own pristine simplicity There's seeing the knowing of

167
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,920
seeing There's hearing knowing of hearing There is desire arises There's

168
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:13,320
knowing of desire There's a thought about how great this will be There's knowing there's a thought

169
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,880
arising And so now they're starting to feel and sense a freedom of allowing

170
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:26,240
each thing to be in this simple state like that That's not possible if it's all entangled together

171
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:33,440
As we as we start being that simple with the raw basic sense data coming in and just experiencing it it starts feeling

172
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,280
very satisfying to be present Um there's a kind of simple satisfaction joy It

173
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,440
feel there's an onward leading movement Yes this feels good This is where now

174
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:54,520
I'm connected And it's a little bit some of the qualities of samadeia coming into play as well which uh makes it feel

175
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:00,200
experientially like this is a good way to be This is now there's more freedom

176
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:05,800
here As it goes along we start seeing the third insight we talked about

177
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:11,560
yesterday that um the conditionality that uh there's a

178
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,640
sensation and that produces certain thoughts and maybe memories

179
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:24,160
uh memories arise and that produces sensations or tightening in the belly or softness in the heart area or something

180
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:32,400
There is we see the conditionality We see that when there's a loud sound outside something inside uh for a moment

181
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,960
just kind of cringes and I'm not the one who's trying to cringe It's I can't say

182
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,320
I do it I might say it's happening to me or it's happening with me but I don't

183
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:50,000
have to even say that I see the conditionality a loud sound and uh

184
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,800
muscles cringe muscles tighten and then they relax Um and so

185
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:04,240
it's cause and effect It's a condition and the effect of the condition that what arises from it And so we start

186
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:12,320
seeing that there's so much of this conditionality so much that that um things that occur that uh you can't

187
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,920
really take credit for it You can't really say it's me doing it Uh this

188
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:25,839
defines me because it's just just what happens There's a breeze against the cheek And you know the the sensations of

189
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:32,880
against the cheek um and knowing the sensation uh those are not me in some

190
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,920
kind of usual sense of my personality who think people think I am or who I

191
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,599
think I am uh I didn't make that happen that the sensations against my cheek um

192
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:50,720
it's just the conditions arise and there's sensation in the cheek and maybe there's a sense of pleasure with it and

193
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,800
um and pleasure just pleasure arising then there might be desire for more

194
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:02,880
pleasure and but the initial arising of that desire for more happened kind of

195
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:09,200
kind of not in any kind of way I can identify with it uh it just seems like

196
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,640
it's a desire floats up and it's almost like you say it's not me it's just a

197
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:22,160
desire and um and then I let you know it floats away if all those things are kind of

198
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:29,440
happening ing in a tangle then um then uh it's me wonderful

199
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,400
me having the pleasure of the breeze against my cheek It's me that wants to have more it's me you know just of

200
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,880
course it's me because it's all happening together in this big bundle of things and I don't see I don't see the

201
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,280
genesis of it where it arises out of something which is not my will not my I

202
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:56,400
have a desire without wanting the desire just seems to float up so when the mind is very quiet and

203
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,680
still in meditation it gets to be a fascinating world uh when we don't

204
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:08,640
identify with things we're kind of seeing the simplicity of different things arising the conditionality of it

205
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,760
and one of the things that begins to happen is the next the fourth kind of insight which is uh usually translated

206
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,359
into English as um comprehension and um maybe we can call

207
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,800
it understanding and this is a little this is somewhat conceptual but it

208
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:33,320
people don't usually don't think of it this way but sometimes people are actually coming to a conclusion

209
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:39,200
usion and that is uh you know to start seeing that there's so many simple

210
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,040
things that are occurring that are not being tied together uh sewn together the

211
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:51,880
Buddha talked about sewn together into some big bundle of things the

212
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:58,920
um uh the um and there's all these things are

213
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,640
occurring and because of conditions And there's no self in it There's no

214
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,680
self assertion no sense of self in it It's just like the breeze against a cheek Uh I didn't make that happen I

215
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,680
don't identify with that sensation there Those sensations define who I am In a

216
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,280
sense they have nothing to do with me except they're happening on my cheek I don't have to add anything build

217
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,560
anything I'm the you know build a story that I'm the best I have the best

218
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,079
sensations best the best breeze that anyone's ever had Ever I should really

219
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,760
get the Guinness World Book of Records to have such a wonderful sensation of a

220
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:46,000
breeze against my cheek I mean all that selfing doesn't go on And so to start

221
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,920
seeing that all this stuff rises and passes comes and goes without self And

222
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:59,440
then some people now understand wow there's a lot of experience here that I've identified with before And a lot of

223
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,720
this stuff is just happening without a sense of self without a self in in

224
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:11,440
um in uh without a self It just kind of phenomena arising It's a natural

225
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,480
phenomena that arises because conditions are such that this comes together to

226
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:23,760
make this arise And um and some people because the mind is pretty still Uh remember there's some

227
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:30,319
degree of samadei and concentration Um uh it feels good It feels true And

228
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:36,440
people start understanding wow there's a lot less self going on here than I

229
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,599
realized Um and some people say it's all not self It's all just conditions of

230
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:47,680
things coming together causes and conditions And some people will say that there is

231
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,920
no self There isn't they'll even say sometimes there is no will Uh because uh

232
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,280
will itself is just uh any kind of deci decisiveness decision is just something

233
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:07,040
that arises from other conditions There's no inherent self who's thinking it and planning it because in a very

234
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:15,359
deep state that you don't see that you just see this cause and conditions and effect or conditions and it's um what it

235
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:22,800
brings forth and so there's this comprehension and people will say wow and then they uh

236
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:30,079
there's no no self here at all and there's no self anywhere and what a great thing and there's freedom here and

237
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:36,480
so it they tend People tend to this this is comprehension This is a little bit like wow this is great I wish I want to

238
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,000
tell everyone about it and this means there wasn't a self in the past There wasn't any in the future

239
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,839
Wow And as in in correlary together with this there's no self in this experience

240
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:56,800
is the clear feeling that everything is arising and passing Everything is impermanent Nothing lasts

241
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,640
And um and if I just sit back and let the river flow all I see is

242
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:09,680
change And so then people come to make it So part of the stage of comprehension

243
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,920
is to make categorical statements to make broad categorical understandings

244
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:22,079
Wow Everything is impermanent Everything is changing Um the basic kind of

245
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:28,160
characteristic of reality is change and impermanence and not self and and um and

246
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:35,040
this is true everywhere in the world for every person all circumstances and so there's a kind of excitement or kind of

247
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,400
uh becoming philosophers kind of conceptualizing and thinking how wonderful this

248
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:48,319
is And for some people this is um uh because of their mind is so clear

249
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:55,359
and settled uh they almost feel like now I'm enlightened now I understand everything and this is fantastic and

250
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:02,880
it's like almost like a divine revelation for some people to come into this state but it's it's not the end of

251
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,240
the path and it's little bit of a detour in the sense that if people get caught

252
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:16,000
up in the conceptual aspects the generalization of it um now I know something true about reality itself and

253
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,040
becomes kind of a move into metaphysical philosophy to make these

254
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:30,319
broad claims and then now I have insight into the very nature of reality and um and so it can be exciting

255
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:36,880
it there's some truth to what we're experiencing and even thinking uh so it's important not to think it's just

256
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,119
pure delusion but um but the idea is to Keep

257
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:47,720
practicing This is the beginning of the practice opening up in new and important

258
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:54,680
ways And so so the stage of comprehension the stage of understanding

259
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:00,880
something that be is a more of a general understanding conceptual understanding

260
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:07,319
that's distinct from a deeper direct experience a deeper uh you know uh

261
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:12,880
non-conceptual experience And that's the the most important insight of the inside

262
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:22,119
meditation and that'll be what I'll talk about tomorrow So thank you very much
