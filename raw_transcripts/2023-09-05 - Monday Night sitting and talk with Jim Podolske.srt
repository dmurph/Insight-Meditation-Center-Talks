1
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:24,900
good evening uh good evening to those of you watching on

2
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,320
YouTube my name is Jim Podolski I'm filling in

3
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,040
for Diana this week and next as she's away

4
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,100
so I'm kind of like your substitute teacher don't expect to hear the same kind of

5
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,820
things that you'd hear from Diana she didn't give me a topic to talk about

6
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:58,199
tonight so I thought I would talk about Labor Day

7
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:04,320
and how that relates to Buddhism uh

8
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,680
if any of you are not from the U.S labor day is a national holiday

9
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:18,020
here in the United States it started in the late 19th century

10
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,979
because of Labor unrest and it was in an official holiday in 1894 by President

11
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:32,340
Grover Cleveland so I think management and labor still is

12
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,000
at odds maybe not quite as strongly as they were back then but

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,700
um I think it's still relevant um

14
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,259
one of the things that I think has changed over time and has certainly changed in my

15
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:59,700
understanding of Labor Day and what it is that I'm celebrating is that

16
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,540
it's not just for trade and labor unions anymore

17
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:15,239
as important as they are and a big part of the U.S economy

18
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,540
I look at Labor as as this Day celebrating all sorts of

19
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:30,300
Labor not just done in factories and in mines but in railroads but in offices

20
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,300
in hospitals in schools

21
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:43,440
Outdoors at construction sites and agricultural fields

22
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,480
um and in the home

23
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,019
there's a lot of Labor that goes on in domestic environments

24
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:02,580
some of its paid labor some of its unpaid labor

25
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,940
some of it's volunteer but I think

26
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:16,739
recognizing that labor is being valuable to what keeps our society running what

27
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,680
keeps us Keeps Us fed which keeps us closed which

28
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,200
keeps us housed which attends to our

29
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,620
um our health and our education

30
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:42,420
so I hope you've all had some chance to reflect on on

31
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,640
labor and its role today

32
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,659
and then the question is well how does that where's the overlap between Labor Day

33
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:59,900
and Buddhism or what the Buddha taught

34
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:07,200
well at the core of what the Buddha taught were practices things that we could do

35
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,319
to cultivate um living in a way that would lead to

36
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:19,160
Greater freedom and greater um

37
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:26,900
release from suffering from greed delusion and hatred

38
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:35,160
and hence at least in the tarabadan tradition of Buddhism what's Central to

39
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:42,600
the teachings are the Eightfold Path and just yesterday we we started a nine

40
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,740
month series on the Eightfold Path um

41
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,680
which is going to start the the first uh Alum the first Factor will be covered

42
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:04,139
next month broadly speaking the Eightfold Path has

43
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:10,979
three groupings there's one grouping of factors related to

44
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:16,740
um cultivating ethics leading A Life That's

45
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,720
at the very least harmless that causes no harm and also may be beneficial

46
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,880
to oneself and others the second grouping is about the

47
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:39,060
cultivation of mind that is through doing mindfulness meditation concentration developing

48
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,820
the ability to have a stable and clear awareness of

49
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,580
what's going on and the third grouping is the wisdom

50
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,660
factors of wise View and wise intention

51
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,259
So within that first grouping of leading an ethical life

52
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:11,400
or cultivating an ethical life there's one element that's about

53
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,440
um right action or wise action

54
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:23,759
so following the precepts in a way that leads to not harming yourself or not

55
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,660
harming others through the things that you do

56
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:36,900
the second factor in that grouping is wise speech

57
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,180
that is speaking in a way that doesn't at the

58
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:48,960
very least doesn't cause harm but also in the best way

59
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,220
um is beneficial to oneself and others

60
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:02,039
and the third factor in that grouping is right livelihood

61
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:09,860
or wise like livelihood and maybe that's where

62
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:16,139
the overlap between Buddhism and Labor Day um

63
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:22,500
is the most obvious right livelihood is about

64
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,220
um in some ways is about earning a living or

65
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:34,620
sustaining oneself in the world in a way that's non-harming

66
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:41,419
and is of benefit to oneself and to others

67
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,000
so that said there's a lot that's been written about

68
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,440
the Eightfold Path there's books and there's talks

69
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,720
there's at least four books that come to mind for me right now there's one by bikubody

70
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,919
won by um Ponte gunaratna Gil frondsdale who's written a book on

71
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:15,780
the Eightfold Path Gregory Kramer and many many others

72
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:22,080
so as a result I'm not going to talk about the Eightfold Path or I'm not even going to talk about right livelihood

73
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,699
I would encourage you if if that phrase right livelihood

74
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:35,099
Sparks your interest that there's many talks on Audio Dharma and Dharma seed

75
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:42,500
and books to read so

76
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:52,260
and that points to how to how do you how do you work or

77
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:59,100
um how do you just live your life some people have said well I'm I'm retired now so I don't have to worry

78
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,519
about right livelihood but unless you lay in bed all day you

79
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,920
probably go out and do things and so how do you how do you spend your time

80
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,959
in a way that's um

81
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,459
beneficial and meaningful

82
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,399
what I want to talk about tonight instead are some practices that I've learned

83
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:35,040
over the years on retreat and

84
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,320
if you'll bear with me they they do relate to to labor

85
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:47,519
um oftentimes unreach if you've been on retreat one of the things that the the teachers

86
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,700
will sometimes say is that meal time is sort of the entertainment

87
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:00,240
portion of the show you know there's there's there's a lot of times when you're doing sitting and

88
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,839
walking and sitting and walking and then when you sit down to eat

89
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:12,540
um it's almost always Pleasant

90
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:19,380
and it's an experience that really wakes up all six senses right when you're

91
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,959
eating there's there's taste there's smell there's sight

92
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,980
there's if it's crunchy sound and also the uh the Mind door you have

93
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:40,380
opinions about what you're eating and so forth so eating can be a very

94
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:47,600
um Rich time to practice mindfulness

95
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:54,720
in a way that generally isn't very challenging

96
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,940
I mean unless they're serving something that you absolutely can't stand you know it's mostly a pleasant

97
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,899
experience to cultivate mindfulness

98
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:16,279
and earlier this year I gave a talk that included a component of how one might cultivate mindfulness through eating

99
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,880
the other practice that isn't taught so much

100
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:29,279
and I I think is well it's not taught outside of retreat

101
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:37,880
practice but I think is is useful for everyone is what you do before you start to eat

102
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:45,180
and the practice that was taught to me is one that requires a certain degree of

103
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:53,399
imagination a certain amount of creativity which is when you look at the food

104
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,560
try to imagine the people that

105
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,220
all the people that were involved in the cultivation of that

106
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,380
food so on Retreat it's it's vegetarian so

107
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:16,440
you know Imagining the people that have tilled the soil who have planted the

108
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,660
seeds who have watered it who've weeded it

109
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:31,699
and then who have harvested it um after its Harvest it's transported

110
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:39,300
some of the food then goes to a place to be processed so there's all sorts of processing that involves people

111
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,760
human labor Packaging [Music]

112
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:52,079
and going out through a distribution network of trucks and trains and other vehicles to

113
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,120
get it um closer to you

114
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,019
and then the people in the kitchen like on Retreat the

115
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:10,560
people in the kitchen oftentimes are other yogis volunteers that have

116
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,579
prepared the food cleaned it um

117
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,940
served it and then there's another whole group of

118
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:29,399
people who ensure that the food that you're going to eat is safe

119
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,680
you know from from the moment it's it's hard from the

120
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,899
moment that it's planted until it gets to you there's there's uh regulations

121
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:47,660
and organizations that labor to make sure that

122
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,700
that it's highly unlikely that you'll get sick it's it's it's maybe

123
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:01,019
99.99 it's it's not a hundred percent but

124
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:07,500
um I think in my life I've only had food poisoning twice that I know of

125
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:14,160
which probably was not the case in my grandparents day or their parents day

126
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,000
um you know you couldn't be assured that what you were getting to eat was

127
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:28,620
um wasn't going to make you ill so those are all so just imagining all

128
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,899
of those people that have been involved in

129
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:41,880
um in producing your food every morning I have oatmeal steel cut oats so I think

130
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:49,040
of the people that grew the oats that harvested them the their processed

131
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:56,120
they go to the store there's people there that handle them

132
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:00,680
I provide the labor to cook them

133
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:10,819
the blueberries and blueberries come from Canada The Raspberries come from Mexico

134
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:18,899
the pomegranates come from South America the walnuts I think are from California

135
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:24,620
the bananas are from Central America so people in all of these places

136
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:33,380
have labored to produce this food and bring it to me

137
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:39,480
and so one of the practices that I do not not every single meal but many

138
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,360
is to just at least briefly think about how

139
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,380
this food has been produced and

140
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:57,260
arrived at my table on my plate

141
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:06,300
and then to add another layer to that think of all of the people that supported those people

142
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:13,920
who fed them who clothed them who house them who educated them who took care of their

143
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,860
health their family their Community their friends

144
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,680
co-workers it's really quite amazing to think about

145
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,620
how many people are involved in just a simple bowl of oatmeal in the

146
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,740
morning

147
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,480
you might ask why am I talking about this like well it's an interesting practice right you

148
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,480
know to exercise the imagination to think about

149
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:58,279
um how how this food came to be here

150
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:06,240
but you want to ask so what who cares

151
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:13,918
well I I can think of three levels or three

152
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:20,339
um ways that that reflection that reflection of how how

153
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,860
your food is produced and and arrives you

154
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:34,140
that can be beneficial the first one is that it brings about a

155
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:40,140
recognition and acknowledgment that

156
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:49,100
there were that you're dependent on many many people for something just as basic as as a meal

157
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,640
um I imagine that the people in this room and the people

158
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,480
on YouTube probably have at least one meal a day but there's many people in the world

159
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:11,760
that don't so you know kind of recognizing that those of us that do get to eat at least

160
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,539
once a day are doing it with the help of many many other people

161
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:23,880
so recognizing that dependence on others

162
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:30,120
the fact that as much as we might like to think of ourselves as

163
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:36,299
um self-sufficient and autonomous

164
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:42,539
that really at least once a day we're relying on many other people

165
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:48,240
that were connected to those other people and they're relying on us

166
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:57,080
you know to um to to feed the economic system

167
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:04,919
so that just that recognition and acknowledgment of dependence I think can

168
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:11,940
have a benefit recognizing seeing more clearly that

169
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:19,039
who are not as maybe independent or autonomous as we think

170
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:26,280
the second level that comes to my mind is

171
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,460
that it's a chance to cultivate gratitude

172
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,340
um

173
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,559
I have to admit growing up gratitude was sort of forced on me by my

174
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:53,280
parents like I had to thank my aunt for getting clothes rather than toys for

175
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,580
Christmas and I looked at it as kind of a um [Music]

176
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:05,340
just the social requirement not so much something that was

177
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:12,440
valuable but as I got older I found that you know actually

178
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:23,120
cultivating gratitude led to Greater happiness and a greater sense of contentment

179
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:31,140
so in this meal reflection you might imagine feeling gratitude to all of

180
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:37,740
these people that are supporting you nutritionally

181
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:47,400
I know one of the practices that I took up oh maybe 10 or more years ago was

182
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,980
every time I went into a coffee shop to get a hot chocolate or something

183
00:20:52,980 --> 00:21:00,000
that I'd always leave some tip but I'd also personally thank the person that made my hot chocolate I'd always

184
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,900
make sure that they heard me say thank you and at first it was kind of mechanical

185
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:13,320
and then after a while I found it really started to become much more automatic that that

186
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,780
um that it made me feel happier and at

187
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:24,660
least some of the time the Barista would um

188
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:30,120
you know light up a little bit by being thanked you know that this wasn't just

189
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:36,860
another customer demand making some demand but that they were actually

190
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,059
grateful for their efforts

191
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:52,640
so this meal reflection practice can be a time to help cultivate gratitude

192
00:21:54,179 --> 00:22:00,000
I know I've read that there are people that keep gratitude journals

193
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,820
that have a journal Maybe before they maybe when they first wake

194
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,919
up or maybe before they go to sleep at night writing one or two things that

195
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:16,500
they're grateful for and over time it's been reported to me I

196
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:25,919
don't do that myself but it's been reported to me that they just feel happier they you know it kind of

197
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,740
kind of works against a certain innate

198
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:37,679
um tendency of the brain to remember what didn't go right you know the the sort of

199
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:44,520
the negativity bias that they talk about that by recognizing that there were things that

200
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:52,500
happened that you're grateful for that that can actually help counteract that bias and actually make

201
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:58,340
you feel a little bit more satisfied a little bit more content

202
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:04,380
so if you

203
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:11,900
if you do this meal reflection whenever it occurs to you to do it

204
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:17,700
There's an opportunity there for cultivating gratitude

205
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:23,159
that mostly is going to benefit you because you're the one that's seeing it

206
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:30,780
you might get a chance to stick your head in the kitchen if you're ornery well it's hard on Retreat you're usually

207
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:38,240
silent but maybe after the retreat thanking the cooks expressing your gratitude for

208
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:45,299
what they've offered you certainly at restaurants or

209
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:53,520
um cafes that's an option or if you go to somebody's house for a meal

210
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,919
thanking them not not just out of a sense of social commitment but out of a

211
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:05,340
sense of um it being beneficial

212
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:14,820
so and then the third level is there's a a practice that's

213
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:22,200
um taught here at IMC like every evening they have something called or every

214
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,480
weekday evening something called the happy hour which is

215
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:34,260
um cultivating one of four practices called Brahma biharas and

216
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:41,280
maybe the main one is loving kindness so in the loving kindness practice

217
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:50,940
that's all taught all over the world you often offer phrases of well-wishing

218
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:57,360
to categories of people to usually start with people that are easy

219
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:04,140
to wish well for like mentors teachers people that

220
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,900
you don't really have any um

221
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:15,000
that mostly you feel very good about might be yourself as well

222
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:24,960
and offering phrases of wishing them to be safe to be happy to be healthy and to

223
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:32,640
be peaceful um so there's usually the the easy

224
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:39,900
people the benefactors friends are usually a second category that are usually fairly easy to be wish

225
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:47,760
well for but you might you know have a few uh little sticking points with them

226
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,760
from time to time and then neutral people people that you don't really know just wishing well to

227
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:01,500
people that you might see in the airport or in the supermarket

228
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,260
and then difficult people so that's the way loving kindness is

229
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:13,740
often taught with this meal reflection you have

230
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:21,059
people that mostly are going to probably fall in one of the first three categories

231
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:26,520
you could see them as benefactors people that are supporting your life in some

232
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:34,200
way they might be friends they might be people that you know

233
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:41,820
um and a lot of them might be neutral people people that you don't really have any direct

234
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:50,100
um connection with but that you can wish them well you know that their lives be safe

235
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:55,640
and happy and healthy and peaceful

236
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:04,440
and you might wonder well what good does it do for me to wish them well if they

237
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:11,400
never see me they don't they have no idea who I am but it does it changes you

238
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:18,419
it changes it that this loving-kindness practice can

239
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:24,659
um soften aversion

240
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:33,179
so you know so the to repeat the three

241
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:40,559
levels there's um the recognition and acknowledgment of

242
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:46,500
being dependent on other people cultivation of gratitude

243
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,320
and then also cultivation of love and kindness so those are three

244
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,380
three um benefits

245
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:04,460
of doing this meal reflection

246
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:14,700
I had dinner on Saturday night with a friend of mine who I've known from a food group

247
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:20,100
that we formed 20 years ago and I told this person that I was going to give a

248
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:27,360
talk about meal reflection and they had actually lived at San Francisco Zen Center for

249
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:34,400
about eight years and so they sent me

250
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:43,380
chant that they do at send center before every meal so here it's not just

251
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:50,640
a single person doing it in silence but it's actually the whole group of people sitting in the dining room read

252
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,240
this chant I won't chant it but I'll read it

253
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:03,419
um we reflect on the effort that brought us this food and consider how it comes to

254
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:10,380
us we reflect on our virtue and practice and whether we are worthy of this

255
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:19,880
offering we regard it as essential to keep the Mind free from excesses such as greed

256
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:27,600
we regard this food as good medicine to sustain our life for the sake of Enlightenment we receive

257
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:34,020
this food first this for the three Treasures

258
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:41,640
next for the four benefactors finally for the beings in the six realms

259
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,740
may all be equally nourished

260
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:52,860
so I'll read this one again you can find this on the San Francisco

261
00:29:52,860 --> 00:30:00,179
Zen Center website we reflect on the effort that brought us

262
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:06,679
this food and consider how it comes to us we reflect on our virtue and practice

263
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:13,919
and whether we are worthy of this offering we regard it as essential to keep the

264
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:21,059
Mind free from excesses such as greed we regard this food as good medicine to

265
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:28,020
sustain our life for the sake of Enlightenment we now receive this food

266
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:34,020
first this is for the three Treasures next for the four benefactors

267
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:41,179
finally for the beings in the six realms may all be equally nourished

268
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:51,000
and this person also gave me another version of this that from tiknot Han

269
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,700
who's a was a renowned

270
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,880
Vietnamese zen teacher

271
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:08,419
and it has a somewhat different ring to it

272
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:14,580
this food is the gift of the whole universe the Earth the sky and the work of many

273
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:19,799
beings may we be mindful and so be worthy of

274
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:29,039
receiving it may we transform our unskillful states of mind and learn to eat in moderation

275
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,940
may we take only foods that nourish us and prevent illness

276
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:41,299
may we practice so that all people in the world will have enough to eat

277
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:48,200
we accept this food that we we may realize the path of understanding and love

278
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:55,799
and I'll I'll read it again I'm not exactly sure where this is on the web but probably if you

279
00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:01,520
look at tiknot Han and food blessing you can find it

280
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:09,059
this food is the gift of the whole universe the Earth the sky and the work of many

281
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:15,779
beings may we be mindful and so be worthy of receiving it

282
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:22,940
may we transform our unskillful states of mind and learn to eat in moderation

283
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:29,640
may we take our take only foods that nourish us and prevent illness

284
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,220
may we practice so that all people in the world will have enough to eat

285
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:41,720
we accept this food that we may realize the path of understanding and love

286
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:54,059
so I felt very happy that this person sent me these these two chants and um they also sent me their version

287
00:32:54,059 --> 00:33:01,140
they [Music] um you don't necessarily have to use the exact wordings here but you might

288
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:07,500
put together one that that works for you what struck me when I read these

289
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,899
um Not only was it acknowledging that it

290
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:19,039
that it comes from many beings

291
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:26,760
but it points to uh howied how much we eat you know that

292
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:33,840
it's like learning to eat in moderation so oftentimes I know for myself oftentimes

293
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,840
if I'm really hungry I just will overeat because it's just it's good food it's

294
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:47,340
really wonderful it's nothing really wrong with that but there is some value in learning to just

295
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,980
just eat what sustains the body

296
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:59,898
um and helps keep the Mind clearer than it can be if we

297
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:06,480
over indulge um there's a pardon here about food that

298
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:13,740
nourishes us and prevents illness so eating healthy food eating food that um

299
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:18,858
is nutritious and doesn't um

300
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,460
doesn't negatively impact our immune system

301
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:33,240
and then finally there's in particularly in the second one there's um we accept this food that we may realize

302
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:38,398
the path of understanding and love so seeing that

303
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:46,020
we can have higher intentions than just having one more meal that the intention

304
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:52,378
behind eating is so that we can

305
00:34:52,379 --> 00:35:00,660
develop we can develop understanding and love understand greater uh

306
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,160
cultivate greater wisdom

307
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:13,440
so that's that's it for me uh

308
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:20,880
I really appreciate all of the

309
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,599
um I not only appreciate appreciate everyone who's makes the food that I eat

310
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:34,740
each day but I appreciate all of the teachers that I've had that

311
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:42,000
have taught me the values of

312
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,859
yeah of living wisely earning a living wisely eating wisely

313
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:55,920
and cultivating gratitude and loving kindness so

314
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,640
thank you all

315
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,079
so do you have any questions or comments or something everyone just take this

316
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,839
microphone I know it seems crazy but there actually

317
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,060
are a couple of people on the on the YouTube channel okay

318
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:28,380
um thank you for the talk I was just thinking of when you're um talking about uh the mindfulness and the appreciation for the food how I was thinking across

319
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:35,040
uh other religions or cultures it seems like food is kind of a um a thing that takes importance and

320
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:42,420
whatnot and I was thinking of like maybe Native American culture and and sort of using all the food that you have and I

321
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:47,520
know like in Catholicism and there are certain days where you don't eat uh certain types of food or whatnot but

322
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:54,900
it's just interesting how that kind of um uh is found kind of a commonality

323
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:01,380
yeah yeah thank you yeah yeah that those are are great observations I mean that

324
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,480
it isn't just it isn't just Buddhists that are into this that I mean food is

325
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,420
you know fundamental to life and and uh in

326
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:20,540
in some ways very fundamental to community and connection and one of the

327
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:26,040
one of the things that I enjoyed when my parents were alive were um

328
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:32,760
no matter what was going on in the family when we sat down together to eat a meal like for Thanksgiving or

329
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:38,339
Christmas or something that there was just a sense of happiness

330
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,780
and connection that came from that

331
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,520
okay well um unfortunately I'm not close to the

332
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,099
computer so I can't tell whether there's any questions in the in the chat

333
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:05,880
so I think I'll just uh end there thank you and uh

334
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,740
may you enjoy the rest of Labor Day
