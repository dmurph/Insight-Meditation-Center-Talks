1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:06,120
so happy to be here and in uh preparing

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,880
for the meditation today um at the

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,199
um I want to kind of create an image for

4
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:23,279
you or an um imagine that

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,039
you you in in the you have two Neighbors in the home you live in one on each side

6
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:37,440
two sets of neighbors and they both have uh children about the same age and you've grown up with these

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,840
children you've known when they you known they were babies you've been a babysitter for them and you known them

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,680
when they were younger kids and and sometimes they came over to your house when the parents couldn't take care of

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,920
them and um and the parents didn't take care of

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,559
them very well there was no love in the home and a lot of conflict and a lot of yelling and and

11
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,680
um and maybe neglect of the

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,560
children but they would come over to your house and play and feel safe with you and the only place they really felt

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:22,159
safe and comfortable and and uh the only place they had someone who believed in them and uh who showed them that they

14
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,759
were lovable and and you loved having them come over and because you were between these two their two homes the

15
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:34,880
kids felt like they were free to come over to you whenever they wanted to you had invited them and they'd often come

16
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,079
and play and go there as a refuge but as they became

17
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:48,159
teenagers and um at some point uh there was a huge conflict between them they

18
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:57,079
both felt hurt and and offended or um violated by the other and uh they were

19
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:03,439
arguing and bordering on fighting and the T the tension and the hostility

20
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,759
between them uh was intense partly because they were both uh responding to

21
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:15,800
each other in the way that they had learned to be in Conflict growing up in their homes and uh it was escalating and it

22
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,519
didn't seem like it was going to go anywhere good but coincidentally because of

23
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,280
their trust in you they both came over to your home at the same

24
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,440
time and they uh so you invited them in and sat down and you could feel the

25
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:40,120
tension the hostility the that between them and kind of they wouldn't look at each other and but you loved them both

26
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:47,080
you cared for them both and certainly you were not going to take sides in the dispute you were going to help them

27
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,720
settle their quarrel in some way or reconcile in such a way that if they had disagreements and had different points

28
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,159
of you or something that they would um settle down and see each other in the

29
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:05,720
with the love and friendship that they had for so many years and um and sure enough just

30
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,440
because they're sitting with you and you were able to be calm and impartial uh listening to both accepting

31
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,280
them both they both calm down and you saw as they calmed down they relaxed

32
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,319
that they started looking at each other and you could feel that there was the the old love they had between them was

33
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:31,560
kind of there but the tension was somewhat still there but as that did ipated you

34
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,959
realized that now it became even your your involvement became even more

35
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,480
important that now even sometimes they would talk about other things and get distracted from their conflict and you

36
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,799
felt that now now it's even more important that you're present for them that you're present and they can feel

37
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,920
that you believe in them you trust them you think that uh you have confidence in

38
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,560
their ability to be honest to talk honestly what's going on and to find a way

39
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,280
way so in the same way when we sit to meditate uh we are the person in the

40
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:15,000
home in between in between all the different aspects of ourselves and uh and we need to be

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,359
impartial we need to trust and have confidence in ourselves and our

42
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,639
capacities that we can find a way and have this kind of confidence and trust

43
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,840
and love and in ourselves so something in ourselves can relax deeply and as we

44
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,960
get calmer in meditation the Mind might easily drift off into thoughts of all

45
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,639
kinds maybe no longer any kind of sense of conflict with ourselves or challenge

46
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,960
in the world and it turns out that this is even more important time for us to

47
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,600
stay present more important time to receive our breath receive our Body

48
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,479
Sensations to just be with ourselves and so with that as an image

49
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,860
for our meditation let's begin so to

50
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:13,520
[Music] um assume a meditation

51
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,918
posture maybe with a

52
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,560
presence with whatever posture you're doing you have a

53
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,440
presence that you would offer the neighboring teens

54
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,680
that they felt that you were there for them that you were going to listen and

55
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,919
hear and feel and and view them with the

56
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:47,199
kindness the care the believing in

57
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:55,720
them and so to sit here with that posture and maybe gently close your

58
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:04,319
eyes and to prepare yourself to Center yourself

59
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:11,120
to be able to offer this caring presence to take a few long slow deep

60
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,440
breaths just big enough that is comfortable for you remains

61
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,639
comfortable relax and settle on the

62
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
exhale

63
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,160
and if it's easy enough extend the exhale a bit so there's more time in

64
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:06,719
which to release in the body settle in the

65
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
body

66
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:46,960
and letting your breathing return to normal but continue on the

67
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,080
exhale to settle

68
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:02,479
into being centered here in your

69
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,400
body so there's stability the kind of stability where

70
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:16,879
you don't lean forward or pull back stability that allows you to

71
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,000
maintain an open impartial

72
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:31,240
presence not taking sides in anything

73
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,440
relaxing the thinking mind or maybe as you exhale

74
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:08,160
allow the thinking mind to relax and maybe it could relax because

75
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:16,079
of your kind way generous caring way in

76
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:21,839
which you are present for your mind for your thinking

77
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,120
mind that you believe in yourself that you can in

78
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:36,000
fact return to

79
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,120
a to becoming

80
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,800
whole that you can in fact settle the mind to touch

81
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,440
into some of the best qualities of

82
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,120
yourself peace and calm

83
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,279
settle into a way of being that you're not operating with a

84
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:16,279
view that anything is wrong about yourself or anything is wrong about your

85
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,720
inner

86
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:31,040
life maybe if there's tension it's just something that can relax

87
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,160
under the warmth of your caring

88
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:04,519
attention and then if it's comfortable for you to imagine that the breathing your

89
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,880
breathing is at the center of all of who you

90
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:22,160
are and that if you can touch that center with care acceptance

91
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,160
impartiality as if that Center can do no wrong

92
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,639
that you just can love and care and make room for listen

93
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:46,000
deeply to yourself through this essential feature

94
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,240
of your life that kind of Nexus meeting point of

95
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,480
your life in your

96
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
breathing

97
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
for

98
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
for

99
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
for

100
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
for

101
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

102
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
for

103
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
for

104
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

105
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
for

106
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
for

107

for

108
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:28,880
and if you find yourself somewhat calm and relaxed but your mind mind is easily

109
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,960
drifting off in thought think of this

110
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,919
time as a time that it's most important for your heart for your breath your

care that you might want to

119
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,158
offer to neighboring

120
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
gids

121
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

122
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

123
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

124
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,679
so then as we come to the end of his sitting

125
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,600
to turn your attention your thoughts your

126
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,320
imagination to the people around you in your

127
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,840
world in your household or in your neighborhood your

128
00:25:51,120 --> 00:26:00,600
community the wider provinces and counties States Nation Nations the

129
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:08,200
world as if your your accepting heart your impartial

130
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:15,440
heart cannot doesn't take sides with anything because you know that more

131
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,960
valuable than taking sides is to be a refuge for all

132
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,600
people to be someone who's safe for all people

133
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:37,320
so that the deepest places of tension holding attachment and

134
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,480
hurt for others can be in the presence of

135
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:50,760
someone who supports its relaxation who supports its

136
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:59,279
release not taking sides when we offer our care and love

137
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:07,880
has a good chance of allowing something deeper than the conflict to heal to

138
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,480
relax the Buddha said make yourself safe for all

139
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:22,158
beings may all beings be

140
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,279
happy may all beings be safe

141
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:35,080
may all beings be

142
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,200
peaceful may all beings be

free

145
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,080
thank

146

you

147
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:48,440
so hello and welcome to this fifth talk on the Buddha's teachings on

148
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:54,760
quarrels and I today I broadcasting this giving this talk from Spirit Rock

149
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:02,559
meditation center and um here here together with uh Quan Yin the great

150
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:09,159
embodiment of U bodhisatwa of compassion which seems appropriate for

151
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:16,120
the topic we're talking about this week and

152
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,559
um once when I I met shinen young talking with him he was one of the Great

153
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:33,519
Elder vasna teachers in the United States brilliant man very

154
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:39,200
creative and as a as a Buddhist teacher and

155
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,960
um he once created a program to teach mindfulness to teenagers I believe some

156
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:52,480
of them were troubled teenagers and um and uh I was really

157
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,480
struck by the the principle by which he

158
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,919
taught these teenagers mindfulness first what he would do is they were going to come to him for

159
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:13,039
the I guess training and mindfulness and he asked them to bring uh whatever was their favorite

160
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:20,080
music and they would come with their favorite music and and they would listen to it a big part of the the session with

161
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:27,600
him was listening to that music and he would not teach them any mindfulness what he would do and he

162
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,840
wouldn't teach it directly what he would do he would at ask them questions about

163
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,200
listening to their music and um questions about the

164
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:46,080
experience of being with their music uh what their mind does when their music there listening to music so I don't know

165
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:53,480
exactly what his questions were but I can imagine that he might ask for example when you most enjoyed your music

166
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,799
how did how did you feel and what was a quality what was how do you characterize

167
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:04,519
your attention when you were most enjoying your music and there were time were there

168
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:10,679
were there times when you kind of lost track of your music that you got drifted off in thought what was that like for

169
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:17,039
you and what was what was that the quality of your being at that point and

170
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:25,120
and being distracted from the music and and as he asked those questions it directed the teens

171
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,240
attention to ways of to pay attention inside of themselves which they maybe

172
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:37,200
had never occurred to pay attention to before and as they appreciated that maybe he was teaching them uh to

173
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,600
recognize the kind of attention they brought to all that and um and the principle that I

174
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:51,320
wanted to share with you that as he taught teens this way and asked them these questions he said the most uh

175
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:57,720
fundamental um principle that the facilitator had to operate with

176
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:03,320
was no matter what answer the teens provided for the questions they were all

177
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:10,279
accepted no question was questioned or not not good enough or wrong every

178
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:16,120
question was right every question was held as if right every answer that he

179
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:22,399
was practicing kind of an unconditional acceptance of each teen and their own

180
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:30,480
experience and how they reported on it and part of what they're learning in my fulness was the example of shinzen Yang

181
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,679
or people he trained to do this um and the kind of attention they brought they

182
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:42,480
created space and allowed each teen to be themselves and perhaps for some of these teens maybe the troubled ones

183
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,320
there had not been many adults in their life who just had that kind of unconditional acceptance or willingness

184
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,639
just to receive them as if nothing is wrong and so they

185
00:32:53,639 --> 00:33:00,480
um they um that's how they learn m fulness so this is also a principle for

186
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,720
us that we can practice this mindfulness this way and for ourselves and maybe in

187
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,480
learning to do this for ourselves that we can do no wrong it's just something else to bring a certain kind of

188
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:19,200
attention to and really see and make space for and uh I think shinzen brought a

189
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,960
sense of safety to the teens so the Buddha said make yourself safe for all

190
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:31,279
beings make yourself safe for yourself so that in the field of your awareness

191
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:37,360
your attention there's no criticism no blame that in a certain way you you can

192
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,799
do no wrong conventionally you might do something which is not healthy and

193
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:49,200
helpful and wholesome but there's something more much more valuable than

194
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:57,519
seeing it as wrong and that is this caring attention that holds it that allows something to settle to resolve to

195
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:06,080
uh process itself to let go because we believe I believe in you all

196
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:12,040
of you that you have the ability to heal to settle to drop into this deeper place

197
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:18,800
of wholeness that is inhibited or blocked whenever we're involved in

198
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,919
seeing ourselves as wrong and of course we do things which are harmful we do

199
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:31,280
things which we regret we do things that uh treat ourselves in ways that are not so healthy uh this is part of the human

200
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,839
life that we do this and not to accept it naively please

201
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:44,560
go ahead and keep doing that but there's a way of offering a kind of safety and attention attentive safety that allows

202
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,919
something to relax and we have access to something deeper within us deeper Wellsprings of well-being and

203
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:57,960
wholeness so when we come applying this to quarrels and disputes that if we're

204
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:04,800
engaged in quarrels and disputes um there is some deeper agenda or deeper

205
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,920
possibility that uh we might want to offer that we learn as we learn it

206
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:19,800
through this Buddhist practice as we learn to do this for ourselves we learn to enter into disagreements conflicts uh

207
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:27,240
in a in an approach that we're not looking to be right or to blame other people we're not looking to cond known

208
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,720
what's happened we're not looking to allow whatever is uh harmful to continue

209
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,800
but we are bringing a kind of an attitude a kind of a tension that uh

210
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:45,640
we're making ourselves safe for others so that people We're In conflict with do not feel our hostility do not feel that

211
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:51,160
we have blamed them or boxed them into a certain perspect uh perception of who

212
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:57,280
they are and and that uh they feel like they're now have to you know verbal box

213
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,880
it out with us to protect themselves at the same time offering

214
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:10,400
safety to others that way does not mean we have to give into them it's actually a to for us to give ourselves safety

215
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:18,040
means that we have the ability to hold our ground to be centered on ourselves and be able to say no no I can't go

216
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:23,400
along with that but we can do that without hostility without yelling without

217
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:29,560
arguments and to feel the Inner Strength that no one's going to push us over we're not going to agree to anything

218
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:36,640
that we don't want to do other people might do things that in the world that maybe we don't agree with but um we

219
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:43,280
don't have to agree then we can maybe stay as a person who is safe for all

220
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,680
beings and this goes along with the Buddha teachings that uh uh one of the

221
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:55,200
core ethical teachings that comes from a ethical set of precepts called the 10

222
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:02,560
skillful actions these are more important than the five precepts because the 10 skillful actions which are the

223
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,319
first four are the same um but these 10 skillful actions are the very actions

224
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:14,240
that people who are on the path to practice uh uh could use as a reference

225
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,000
point for how to live their lives the five precepts are just basic precepts of

226
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,960
living a good life we can do uh for practitioners we want to up the standard

227
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:31,640
we want to be more careful and these 10 skillful actions provide that and one of

228
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:39,720
them is uh we are to abandon malicious speech hostile speech

229
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:45,200
and I want to read to you the full explanation of the how how to practice

230
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,400
with abandoning malicious speech one abstains from malicious

231
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:58,560
speech one does not repeat elsewhere what one has heard here in order to

232
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,280
divide those people from these nor does one repeat these PE uh to

233
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:12,240
these people what was heard elsewhere in order to divide divide these people from

234
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,880
those So to avoid dividing people to not speak in a way that there ends up being

235
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,400
hostility between people or or suspicion between people or hostility in any kind

236
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,160
of way thus one is one who reunites those

237
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:36,359
who are divided a promoter of friendships he who enjoys Concord

238
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:43,960
rejoices in Concord Delights in Concord a speaker of words that promote

239
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:50,680
Concord so um so this the different this this

240
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:55,720
very important distinction between speaking words that divides people and

241
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:02,200
even if the person that you're talking about is not present if you speak in kind of malicious gossipy way about

242
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:07,359
someone about how they made a mistake and how terrible they are uh you are now

243
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:12,760
promoting a division between the the person you're talking about and the person that

244
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:19,880
you're talking to and that spreads and uh but to be a person who

245
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:26,960
doesn't have uh divide but maybe you need to talk about some of the difficulties and behavior of others

246
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,359
which is harmful or challenging you have to figure out the solution for but the

247
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:39,160
idea is to do so in a way that doesn't create divisions uh it might be with the

248
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:46,000
attitude I'm really troubled by this person's doing I think it needs to stop I can't go along with it but I want to I

249
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,480
have to figure out a way to talk to this person or find a way to deal with this that doesn't perpetuate the hostility

250
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,920
doesn't accentuate the Divide if anything can I address this issue in a

251
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,720
way that uh that shows my care or shows kind of an attempt to try to be friends

252
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:12,760
again and um the um um and so the

253
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,280
um um um so this is this is a kind of a

254
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,800
fundamental teaching the Buddha has for people who are on the path of

255
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,640
Liberation and uh because to to divide to be hostile to be malicious goes in

256
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:35,680
the opposite direction for people who are wanting to go the path to freedom to

257
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:45,680
compassion to care and um so um but that does not mean that

258
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:51,680
avoiding malicious talk the talk that divides to talk with in Friendly ways or

259
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,640
talk in ways that unite people doesn't mean that we're avoiding difficult conversations

260
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:05,200
um so the another quote from the Buddha this has to do with the monastic

261
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:12,720
community and this is a community that's has everyone has AG agreed to uh

262
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,000
Come Together live together by certain agreements that they're accountable for

263
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,240
so it's in that context that he uh has this rule for monastics or is this

264
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:31,599
guideline sometimes monastics have to reprove each other sometimes they have to talk to

265
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,640
each other and say you know what you did wasn't right or that's not how it should be or you may did something that was

266
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,359
harmful here and um and you know there's there's all these rules monastics have

267
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:47,760
hundreds of rules that they have to live by and um and so and they're accountable

268
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:54,440
to them and some are quite serious there's a set of five that if they break these rules uh that they're

269
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:01,119
automatically no longer a man Mantic and can never be a monastic again like if they kill

270
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:08,240
someone and um so here what the Buddha said how does a monastic reprove

271
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:14,160
another by speaking at the right time speaking what is

272
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,839
factual speaking with gentleness and speaking about what is

273
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:24,960
connected to Liberation and speaking with Good Will

274
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,880
so this is a high stand standard So speaking with friendliness with Good Will so if you don't have good will

275
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:38,160
don't reprove anyone don't confront someone about what they've been doing if

276
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,280
you can't have Goodwill for them don't do it at the wrong time when they're not ready when it's not going to

277
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:53,119
have any benefits uh be careful to speak what is factual don't interpret

278
00:42:53,119 --> 00:43:01,359
don't you know lead with with your feelings your attitudes as if that's the

279
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:07,960
truth speak with gentleness and then I love that speak with what with what is connected to

280
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:14,720
Liberation speak in a way that's connected to your own Liberation not in the opposite way speak in a way that

281
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:20,760
supports liberation of others and um and

282
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:27,400
uh uh and in the liberation of others you can um

283
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:33,040
the first step to that is to help people feel safe with you even if they're

284
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,800
attacking you hopefully just verbally there's something very powerful about

285
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:45,480
being a safe person for them so uh we will be in quarrels and

286
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:51,800
disputes conflict disagreements in this world of ours and uh there is another way than

287
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,920
violence there is another way than um uh hostility

288
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:02,480
and and uh divisiveness and I'll end with uh

289
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,599
another that I mentioned on my Sunday talk uh this week about the different uh

290
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:15,160
groups uh that are offering a nonviolent approach uh that trying to unite people

291
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:23,040
not divide people in the conflict in the Middle East and there's a an organization called Family

292
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:29,240
Circle and there about 700 members and these are people in Israel and Palestine

293
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:35,240
whose children have been killed in the Israeli over the years decades over the

294
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:42,319
Israeli um Palestinian violence and um and uh they get them to

295
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:50,040
come together because of their shared grief shared pain of having lost their sometimes very young children um one

296
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:56,520
person I read about uh his children was standing a Palestinian child was standing in front of the school imagine

297
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:03,520
school and was shot by um Israeli bullets the context of it uh you know I

298
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,640
don't know but still it was the killing of a child and very difficult but they

299
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:17,920
these parents come together to tr to um and become friends with each other across the Israeli Palestinian divide to

300
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,440
to find another way to find a way of Peace because they believe that there's

301
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:31,040
no solution in violence it just perpetuates the Cycles so let's not perpetuate the

302
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:36,480
cycles of any kind of violence including those that come out of ordinary disputes

303
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:45,079
and quarrels and let's find a way to bring safety peace and nonviolence so

304
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:51,480
that the best in each person's heart can grow can we have confidence that in at

305
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,599
the base of the of the heart the base of everyone's heart there is a a potential

306
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:04,359
for wholeness for love for nonviolence for care that uh can heal this
