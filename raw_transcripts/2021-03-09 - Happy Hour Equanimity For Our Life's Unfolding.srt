2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,080
be with you whether you're joining on zoom or on youtube

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,000
and um the theme for our practice today

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,640
is continuing to practice with um the fourth brahmavihara the

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:32,398
brahmaviharas are the practices of the heart heavenly abodes um first one being meta loving-kindness

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:41,040
second one being karuna compassion third one mutita vicarious joy and the fourth one

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,559
being up or equanimity and we've been going through all the brahmavihara since

8
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,840
the beginning of the year uh methodically and if this is your

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,480
first time at happy hour no problem whatever you need to know will be shared with you i'm

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:06,000
just giving some context here so the practice of equanimity or upeka

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,520
is a crown jewel of buddhist practice and it shows up on so many different

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,200
lists and as i was saying on friday there are ten different types of equanimity

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,320
and some of you might have been familiar with the seven factors of awakening

14
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,640
equanimity shows up there in a different way it shows up there supporting our awakening or

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,840
our being in the world and with brahma bihara as as these four fantastic

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:43,680
practices equanimity shows up as a way relationally it shows up relationally to

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,520
for us to practice with relation to ourselves in the relation to others

18
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,439
people we care about people we don't know all beings etc so it becomes a

19
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:04,079
relational practice in some way and um it's a beautiful practice it's um

20
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,560
the the near enemy of it as i mentioned and it's bear mentioning uh worth

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,000
mentioning again is aloofness or or indifference and

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,160
sometimes we might think of we might mistakenly think of equanimity

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:30,080
as not caring just uh being aloof indifferent but that's

24
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,000
the near enemy that's the masquerader it's what masquerades as equanimity

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
equanimity and again it's okay to fall into the near enemy or even the far enemy which

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,519
is the attachment and aversion that's the fire enemy so it's it's not a sin to for those things to

27
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,400
arise oh they arise you notice what's happening and you learn you learn from where the heart and the

28
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,440
mind is falling oh yeah i'm veering a little towards the right i'm veering towards the left

29
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,319
so yeah you learn by by actually you learn better about this practice by actually

30
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,760
falling into the near and far enemies and realize this doesn't quite feel like equanimity and

31
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,400
and seeing what is needed to to adjust your own practice so don't think like

32
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,840
you've made a mistake or it's a waste of time no it's whatever practice however it arises for you as as long as

33
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,440
you're aware and and you don't self-judge and you just kind of self

34
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:41,200
oh you're curious like oh what's happening here how do i work with this it's all good so one more thing to say

35
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,000
about equanimity before we start our practice together is that there is a sense of

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,959
care and equinimity there is a sense of care presence even warmth which holds

37
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,239
all holds everything that arises and passes with a sense of peace with a

38
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:09,280
sense of equipoise and stability so so we started on friday

39
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,799
with the neutral person traditionally that's where you start

40
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:21,680
this practice and then the second uh category that we extend to tonight

41
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,639
is ourselves so we're going to do equanimity for our own

42
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,759
condition in life and there are a lot of different potential phrases to use

43
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:41,120
i will offer a few today and um as many well many of you are

44

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:35,840
above and beyond what you give yourself credit for

112
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:45,360
opening up to the possibility of yes there is this possibility there is this

113
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,960
dimension of stability

114

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:17,840
that's deep within

117
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,559
feeling your abdomen lower abdomen feeling your sit bones

118
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:13,840
connected to the earth your shoulders dropping your head tall

119
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,720
it's not so much that you have to try to be

120
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:30,559
it's more that you notice that it actually is it's a part of you it's a part of you

121
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:36,158
to be stable

122
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:45,600
grounded spacious as if your heart shining is shining with

123
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,679
resilience stability

124
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
equipoise

125
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:09,840
your body grounded connected to the earth rooted

126
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:23,840
in ways that might even surprise you

127
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:43,600
but your breath ah the out breath just relaxes

128
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,400
lets go of any tightness tension

129
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:55,360
gets you even more connected to mother earth

130
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,360
the more connected and rooted you feel

131
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,679
the taller you sit

132
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:19,840
the more you can contain

133
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:46,400
just as the buddha statue many of them have the mood rather

134
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:53,919
the gesture of the earth the earth touching mudra the buddha

135
00:24:53,919 --> 00:25:01,840
touching the earth is earth be my witness

136
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,200
i am here i belong here

137
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,840
sense of stability groundedness

138
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:31,279
from this place of stability connection to the earth

139
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:43,840
not easily toppled over

140
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,919
from this place you can open up

141
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,840
from this stable platform of the body

142
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:25,840
opening up the comings and goings of your life

143
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:36,159
and not to be lost in thought still rooted in your body

144
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,840
feeling your feet your abdomen your sit bones

145
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:52,000
the contact points

146
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,640
and just as a well-rooted tree the winds can come and go

147
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:05,440
the leaves might ruffle but the tree is well rooted it's not

148
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:12,960
going to topple over so you can open up maybe to

149
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:21,840
one consideration in your life one comings and goings

150
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:27,278
not to be overwhelmed with too many just one

151
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:35,600
feeling your stability as you allow this consideration to be

152
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,840
held to be here

153
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,840
one challenge maybe not the biggest one yet

154
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,559
this can be here this consideration

155
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,000
like a wind that ruffles the leaves but there's stability in

156
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:17,840
the tree the trunk and the body

157
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:33,440
and with respect to this just as you feel your breath continuing

158
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,520
to connect with the breath reciting silently one of the phrases of

159
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,840
equanimity i'll offer a few options

160
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,158
may i accept

161
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,360
may i accept their rising and passing of things

162
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,200
with equanimity and balance

163
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:27,840
connecting this phrase to your breath in breath out breathe

164
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,080
may i accept the conditions of my life with ease

165
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:57,760
or whether i understand it or not

166
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:09,840
things are unfolding according to a lawful nature

167
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:22,880
may i be undisturbed may i have peace may i

168
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:33,840
accept the comings and goings of events

169
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,760
whichever version works best for you

170
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:28,399
or it could be worthless

171
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,399
with just a sense of holding

172
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:43,679
with care with presence

173
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:57,840
what cannot be controlled

174
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,158
there could be just a sense of equanimity and peace

175
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:58,559
spacious expansive beyond time and space

176
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,840
eternal

177
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,600
not so much ours

178
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:21,760
something we're sharing tapping into so in that way it is ours and not ours

179
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:35,839
the grace of equanimity

180
00:34:52,399 --> 00:35:03,839
the bird's eye or a cosmic view of comings and goings

181
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:21,160
whether i understand it or not life is unfolding

182
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:28,320
[Music] according to a lawful nature

183
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,838
may i accept and be heartbeat harmony

184
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:55,440
and flow with the unfolding

185
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:09,838
of events

186
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,839
and for the last moment of this practice period

187
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:46,640
may i be at peace with whatever a rose or did not arise

188
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:54,320
during this practice period holding it with spacious equanimity not

189
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:01,760
resisting not attaching

190
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,359
it was like this right now it is like this right now

191
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:15,838
things are like this right now

192
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:24,800
may all beings everywhere have profound peace and ease

193
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:43,090
in the midst of the flow of life

the benefit of the community anything you like to share or ask

232
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,359
yeah so there can be such a sense of stability

233
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:40,560
and heart opening to be with what arises and the sense of universality what i was calling this

234
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,319
sense of you know this equanimity or equipoise

235
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:51,359
it's both yours and not yours in a way there's a sense of universality that

236
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:57,359
that can arise with this practice in a way similar to practice of meta this this loving

237
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:05,359
kindness tapping into this beauty and and graciousness of generosity so

238
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:11,200
so how about we practice in small groups and we'll reserve some time

239
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:18,720
at the end for for reflections that might come up that might the wheels might be greased as you

240
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:24,960
discuss in small groups with each other which is really precious heartful practice

241
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:31,359
so for the practice today in in community the invitation i have

242
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:38,560

248
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:17,520

249
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:24,280
yeah so much wisdom and connection that comes out of group practice so

250
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,760

252
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:44,160
welcome back everyone so we have a few minutes

253
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:50,720
for reflections what came up um what do you notice oh and first actually

254
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:56,240
i'll respond to jamie's question who had

255
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:01,440
asked before we went right into before we went to the groups

256
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:08,079
can you comment on what you mean when you refer to things unfolding lawfully so this

257
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:14,000
is um the the the teaching of causes and conditions

258
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,640
cause and effect that there are laws of nature you can think of them both as

259
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:26,960
laws of physics laws of karma laws of you know for example in the simple way

260
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:33,200
if you if you are nice to someone the chances are they'll be nice to you if you're nasty to them if you

261
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:39,040
if you slap them well they won't be very happy so their lawful nature there are things

262
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:45,200
that life unfolds according uh unfolds according to lawful

263
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:52,319
uh according to a lawful nature both physics and and the physics of of how life

264
00:47:52,319 --> 00:48:00,319
works basically so that's the lawful nature it's not as if you would plant say a seed of a mango tree and you

265
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:06,880
would get a fern tree it just there are things unfold according to a lawful

266
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:15,040
nature in this this world it's not random so that's what that refers to jamie so

267
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,160
so now your chance

268
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:25,839
