145
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,360
thank you all thanks for your practice

146
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,480
so we started five minutes earlier today since i didn't give a darn it slice

147
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,399
so i stopped five minutes early too 30 minutes sit together

148
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:26,080
went by quickly at least for me so

149
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:31,120
so the couple of themes that i brought in uh for our practice today we first

150
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,760
started with as always with grounding with the breath with the body settling and sense of

151
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:44,320
kindness towards this body acceptance of this amazing body then we turned

152
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,799
to meta for ourselves simply with the four phrases of meta or

153
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:58,480
whatever your phrases might be and then we turned to appreciate

154
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,919
goodness someone's kindness to us recently in the past

155
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,878
and we let our hearts we invited our hearts to rejoice celebrate really

156
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:18,960
um feel the beauty the goodness of the kind act as a

157
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,079
way of uplifting appreciating kindness goodness

158
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,200
and i do wonder whether you felt an up uplift in your heart

159
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:35,118
i know that i was smiling just feeling this kindness this goodness from this this person

160
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:42,240
a young person in fact just just relishing wow goodness in the world goodness

161
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,440
shining this person and then from there turning to to meta

162
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,878
sharing kindness meta good will for this being

163
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,480
as our gift of generosity um

164
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,400
and then at the end turning again to ourselves or to both of us and then opening to all beings

165
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:11,040
so all these turns um many times you know we might start practicing and

166
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:18,640
maybe practice feels heavy or like a thud and then we turn to say appreciating

167
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:26,240
this body and maybe something opens up or we turn to appreciating someone's goodness and wow the heart just lights

168
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,560
up there's a sense of brightness in the heart [Music] and that lights up the rest of our

169
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:41,119
practice for them for ourselves for others so there are lots of helpful skillful means

170
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:47,680
that that we can use in this practice to cultivate to cultivate kindness to

171
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:56,078
cultivate good will to turn to keep turning our heart to kindness towards others ourselves

172
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:03,519
so we have a few minutes um [Music]

173

174
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:15,760
for the benefit of the sangha maybe your opening if there was an aha moment that helps others also

175
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,040
for their aha moments if there's something challenging you can bring it up how do i work with

176
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,880
this because if you have this question the chances are other people have the same question

177
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,040
and there's no wrong question here treat it all with kindness

181
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,200
as i sip my tea

182
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,839

184
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:23,320
for your practice radiant catherine

185
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:29,280
um hi thank you all right for the practice

186
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:36,720
um i'm in a moment where i'm i can feel like i'm

187
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,400
triggered into old habits hold old patterns that are really

188
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,000
deep ones and i kind of called the situation in because i want to work with them and

189
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,079
heal them um but i'm seeing that like part of that

190
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,119
pattern or habit is to really feels like the door is really

191
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,450
shut on self meta um and

192
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:11,119
[Music] the way that that is shut is through like disconnection as opposed to like i think

193
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:17,599
it's easier for me when i'm feeling like a big like fear or anger or sadness to like turn

194
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:24,960
love towards that feeling but towards but this is kind of like a dissociation

195
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,839
that makes it very hard to even stay focused enough to remember to to come

196
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:38,400
to or even remember what it feels like what self kindness feels like

197
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,880
so i think personally i'm just naming that because that helps like bring it back

198
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,800
because i can feel emotion coming up now um but i just wanted to name that in case

199
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,880
other people have that experience too and how to work with that yeah yeah thank you

200
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,920
thank you katrin and don't meet yourself just yet um thank you for bringing that up and

201
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,400
and just to reflect back what i heard you say was

202
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:13,599
some challenge with another person and you intentionally brought that in and you call that in uh to to

203
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:19,760
work with it to to bring some method to it to yourself to them and and then it became perhaps a little

204
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:26,480
overwhelming in in a way and and the old pattern habit patterns of of your mind came in i

205
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:33,200
was like wow overwhelmed okay i've lost contact i've lost contact with myself

206
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,560
because i'm hurting right now and yet this is so hard i'm so angry and afraid

207
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:44,640
and all there are like wait how do i connect here and and you actually naming

208
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,960
that and sharing that oh it's brought some connection yes it's like this and it's okay it's not as

209
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,520
overwhelmed when you actually say it out loud it's not as overwhelming as it seemed silently in your mind a moment

210
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:04,960
ago isn't that amazing and yes yeah so that overwhelm oh yeah it

211
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,240
it uh it comes down uh it comes down a notch and like oh yeah i

212
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,880
can connect with myself i'm here yes and there's and appreciating them the sense of uprightness that has spoken up and

213
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,640
shared this said this out out loud and another thing

214
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,400
i would suggest as you may know is is bow to this uh

215
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:35,760
you know what you've brought in to work with when it becomes a little uns unstable and then disconnect and just

216
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,319
bow to it thank you i will come back to you i respect you and now let me

217
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:49,280
put you aside for a moment and and stabilize with my hand with my feet just

218
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:56,160
just loving the connection i mean it doesn't have to be any more than that just like i'm here i'm here and imagine

219
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:04,240
yourself you're the buddha you're the buddha sitting under the bodhi tree touching the earth but you just touched the earth

220
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:11,520
ah mister has been my witness i'm here yes i'm here i'm here and that sense of connection

221
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,880
can to the earth can bring that sense of connection to yourself and the way back

222
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:24,400
into meta how does that sound yeah it feels good and it's helping me

223
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,920
with the piece that i that i think was making it so hard which is um to

224
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,760
actually offer compassion and love to the part of me that shut down out of

225
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:42,960
such a like out of care right that the overwhelm into like dissociation and even like

226
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:49,040
self-criticism like i s i can see again how like oh sweetheart like you're really doing your

227
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:55,920
best you're doing your best to to protect this tender heart and this overwhelm

228
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,800
um and that feels like the the way back in beautiful beautiful beautiful he said

229
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,160
beautifully felt exactly oh sweetheart thank you thank you

230
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,839
thank you and sweetheart you can relax it's okay yeah that's beautiful thank

231
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,480
you catherine

232
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:35,520
so yeah the reflections from today i see there's a question

233
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,359
uh privately is coming by something i taught actually yesterday morning on uh

234
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,680
youtube when i talked about not breathing into the nostrils that

235
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,280
that if you're doing if you're noticing your breath here at the anapanas but the

236
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,800
mindfulness spot uh notice it outside not inside

237
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,950
your nose and

238
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:09,760
[Music] and asking for a little more explanation

239
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,520
about that so so the problem again if you just practice a little bit here and there you

240
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,800
wouldn't notice if you're doing deep sinus breathing but if you keep practicing more and more

241
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,800
and more there's a sense of constriction in the nose they will become so

242
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:34,079
prominent that inside the nose it will feel like bricks and you and one will not be able to

243
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:40,480
breathe actually just one will feel heartless hardness what's called the earth element sense of hardness in the

244
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:48,560
face in the back of the nose happens so that is the problem with deep sinus breathing as a practitioner bad habit

245
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:57,760
so so time has come let's turn to practicing in small groups together

246
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,800
and the invitation is to [Music]

247
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:09,040
share kindness share kindness with each other this is an opportunity the small group's an

248
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,960
opportunity i mean now if you've been sharing kindness in your mind to yourself to others

249
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,480
now you have the opportunity to be kind to show up with kindness

250
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:27,280
to turn your heart your mind towards kindness and the prompt i'd like to give you a

251
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,960
prompt the prompt is um as you are showing up with kindness this is the

252
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,599
how the what is um if you'd like to share something about an act of kindness that has been

253
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,520
shared with you recently maybe what came up for you in your meditation tonight or or

254
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,640
anything else or you can also share silence and space with others

255
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,920
let's go reverse alphabetical order based on your first name

256
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:02,720
one person will say maybe just one nugget not a long monologue maybe just a minute

257
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:08,480
the other person will say just one more minute and then the next person another minute they'll come back to you and

258
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:16,160
you'll go round and round until the time is up and just speak from your own experience

259
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:21,280
not managing or or um

260
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:28,560
you know trying to control other people's experience let them be as they are even if they are with you in silence

261
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:37,200
let it be just as it is so going to create the rooms here

262
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:43,280
and um yeah take care of yourselves

263
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,880
take care of each other be kind be kind be kind i cannot

264
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,240
