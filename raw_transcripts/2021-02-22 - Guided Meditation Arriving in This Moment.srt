00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:08,160

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:19,760

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:28,480
so glad you're here with me so i don't have to sort of look at a screen by myself um i like to start my

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,040
sits with a pawn because i have found that i think

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,120
constantly every time i sit down to meditate and so i have trained myself

6
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:50,399
that if i'm going to think about something i want to think about the last thing that was that i heard or the last thing and if

7
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,440
it's a poem it kind of helps me allow the thinking

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,640
to help me settle more and so uh i'm going to start by reading this

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,320
little poem with you and um and then i'll read it at the end

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,840
before the bell so i'll read a poem ring a bell we'll sit i'll do a little bit of guidance

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:22,640
and then i'll ring the read the form at the end of a half hour so this poem is uh entitled blackbirds

12
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:30,560
by julie codwadler stop and this is what julie says

13
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,400
i am 52 years old and have spent truly the better part of my life

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,920
out of doors but yesterday i heard a new sound above my head

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,640
a rustling ruffling quietness in the spring air and when i turned

16
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:01,600
my face upward i saw a flock of black birds rounding a curve i didn't know was there

17
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,560
and the sound was simply all those wings all those feathers

18
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:16,319
against air against gravity and such a beautiful whining the whole flock

19
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:24,080
taking a long wide turn as if one body in one mind

20
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,879
how do they do that if we lived only in human society what a

21
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,160
puny existence that would be but instead we live and

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,400
move and have our being here in this carving and soaring world that is not

23
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:50,879
our own so that when mercy and tenderness triumph in our lives and when even

24
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,760
more rarely we unite and move together towards a common good

25
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:06,799
we can think to ourselves ah yes this is how it is meant to be

26
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,400
that's what we're going to think of remember that this is how it is meant to be

27
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:22,080
so whatever is happening in your sick this this we spent the better part of our

28
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,239
lives sitting but in this moment something might be a new

29
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,840
all right so let us get started here

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:46,080
let's find ourselves a comfortable place

31
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,000
when you're ready you can close your eyes

32
00:03:52,080 --> 00:04:01,840
just let whatever sounds happen to be around you just come to the foreground

33
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,480
here where i'm at i can still hear the uh resonance of the bell and

34
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,799
it's very faint i have a fan on i can hear that

35
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,959
i hear little creaks in the house

36
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,840
and i hear silence

37
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:37,599
see if you can just tune into what you hear without the judgment of it just

38
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,560
curing we're just sitting here hearing

39
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:54,160
allowing the ears to do what ears do on their own without our help we don't need to do anything

40
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,840
we can just notice

41
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,960
gradually you can notice the body sitting it's like shifting your attention from

42
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,039
the hearing to the body just sitting here the posturing

43
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,440
maybe noticing how heavy the body is

44
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,240
the skin and the flesh of the body just sitting here wherever you're at or lying down just

45
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,599
the weight that felt sense of the weight of the body

46
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,120
and if you sense that you're

47
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,840
maybe holding yourself up see if you can just let the weight of

48
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:07,039
your body be as it is release the belly

49
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,440
release the arms maybe the tightening of our torso

50
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,440
release our thighs and our legs and just let the weight of the body

51
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,919
be held by whatever you are sitting on

52
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,000
maybe notice the weight of your arms from the underside of your arms or the weight of your legs

53
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:49,840
from the underside of your arm where you philip moffat points to

54
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:00,000
you just hear this heavy body there may be a sense of hardness

55
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,639
you can feel the bones in the body the bones of the feet connecting with the softness of a

56
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,160
socks or carpet or

57
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,759
the floor you can feel that hardness even the sit bones sitting in a cushion

58
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,280
or chair you still feel the hardness of bone bones on the arms and

59
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,840
the body torso head

60
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:48,160
just arriving in this moment here and now preparation

61
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,720
for our sit the poem of being interested in whatever is

62
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,080
happening right now is a new experience the way it's

63
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,039
supposed to be

64
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,638
getting grounded in our seat here and now

65
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:24,720
and allowing the experience of this moment to unfold however it unfolds

66
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:33,440
could be thinking talking could be irritation unpleasantness

67
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,680
pleasantness it doesn't matter what it

68
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:46,720
is when you establish a sense of groundedness in this moment

69
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,839
point your view towards curiosity and interest

70
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,839
just sit with whatever devices

71
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,160
now you might notice the breath body breathing

72
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:37,839
you might also notice the mind just getting lost in a lot of thought

73
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,959
so use this anchor of this arriving in this moment it could

74
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:54,000
be the anchor of sound that helps you remember where you're at

75
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,760
it could be the anger of sitting here feeling the heavy body just sitting here

76
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,880
hard steady it could be the movement of breath in

77
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:19,839
and out up and down

78
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,680
whichever anchor works for you helps you remember to come back to this

79
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,839
present moment

80
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:43,279
we can steady our attention like in the poem so that we can

81
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:51,120
see something unusual see something unique

82
00:10:51,519 --> 00:11:01,839
and see something real and experience something for the first time

83
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,600
so we'll sit here and now maybe every so often just

84
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,839
drop in a little reminder

85
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,680
and trust that what you're seeing what you're experiencing

86
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:51,759
what you're noticing is all part of the process

87
00:11:51,920 --> 00:12:11,839
nothing to get away from of things something to be understood to be noticed

88
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
so

89
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
so

90
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
so

91
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
so

92
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,839
so

93
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
so

94
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
so

95
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
so

96
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
so

97
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
so

98
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
so

99
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,240
don't forget remember the sound

100
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,639
remember the body remember the stainless of the body of

101
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:49,279
the movement of the breath to anchor and keep your fear tethered

102
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:55,839
to now

103
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
this

104
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
so

105
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
so

106
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
so

107
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,840
so

108
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
so

109
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:16,640
allowing the moment to unfold however it unfolds

110
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:26,000
our little mantra this is who they meant to be

111
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:51,840
i just want to know that we know what is arising

112
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
so

113
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
so

114
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
so

115
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
so

116
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
so

117
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
so

118
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
so

119
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
so

120
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,840
so

121
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840
so

122
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:14,320
i'd like to read the poem again now that we've had 30 minutes of quiet

123
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:27,840
to kind of settle ourselves

124
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:37,039
i'm 52 years old and have spent truly the better part of

125
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:44,799
my life outdoors but yesterday i heard a new

126
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:52,840
sound above my head a rustling ruffling quietness in the spring

127
00:29:52,840 --> 00:30:02,320
air and when i turned my face upward i saw a flock of black birds

128
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,679
rounding a curve i didn't know was there

129
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:14,480
and the sound was simply all those wings all those feathers

130
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:24,399
against air against gravity such a beautiful whining whole fly

131
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:33,200
taking a long wide turn as if of one body and one line

132
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,760
how do they do that if we lived only in human society

133
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:48,799
what a puny existence that would be but instead we live and move and have

134
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:54,480
our being here in this curving and soaring world

135
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:02,320
that is not our own so that when mercy and tenderness triumph in our lives

136
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,720
and when even more rarely we unite and move together towards a

137
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,559
common good we can think to ourselves

138
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:33,840
oh yes this is how it's meant to be

139
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,840
you
