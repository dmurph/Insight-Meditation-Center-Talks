1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,799
welcome welcome back to our week of finding the supports that uh enable us

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,080
to cultivate samadi so we've been taking just a

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:21,160
little more time for meditation in these mornings and more time in silence and then also uh the opportunity

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,840
has been to practice stronger mindfulness throughout the

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,840
day and to investigate to discover what things

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,360
enhance and what things detract from a feeling of being settled in the practice

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,680
an ability to come to some state of

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,239
collectedness so we're allowing for not having to

9
00:00:53,239 --> 00:01:00,559
know not having to know when we'll experience anything particular in

10
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,200
practice including sady and not having to know uh not having to push ourselves

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,200
in that direction what we're doing is very simply and very steadily coming back

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,560
again and again to what we've been doing this week is focusing on the

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,040
breathing uh being very attuned being present with the inhalation and the

14
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,320
exhalation and using counting of the breath in the background or in the periphery of awareness to

15
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:41,280
support keeping the Mind steady keeping the Mind present or bringing the Mind back to

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,439
presence the other day I read this brief excerpt from the samadi suta that I'll

17
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:54,320
read again here wise and mindful you should develop immeasurable

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,560
concentration that is concentration based on immeasurable Goodwill

19
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:08,200
compassion appreciation or equinity so these four

20
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:15,599
qualities these Brahma vihara support the heart and mind coming

21
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:23,120
to a place that is set steady settled in coming to uh

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,800
Stillness and in cultivating somadi the suta goes on to say that as a

23
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,000
result of samati based on these forms of wholehearted

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,400
goodwi when wise and mindful one has developed immeasurable

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,920
concentration five realizations arise right within

26
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,599
oneself it goes on to list these five realizations and this morning i' just

27
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:59,959
like to highlight the first of them um as inspiration an interesting look at

28
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:06,200
what may arise as we cultivate samade as we do this practice of following the

29
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:13,319
breath and of perhaps counting in the background so here's the first

30
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,760
realization the realization arises right within oneself that this concentration

31
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,400
is blissful in the present and will result in Bliss in the

32
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,920
future so that's interesting first of all it's a realization so it's something

33
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:38,599
that will come with the practice we don't need to try to make it happen and in fact if we try to make Bliss happen

34
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:46,159
that's pretty much a guarantee that it won't happen that kind of striving um or pushing just is

35
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:54,000
counterintuitive but think about what the word bliss uh canotes for you or what it brings up uh for me it really

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,239
feels like kind of a steady glowing form of happiness or a

37
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,200
warmth it's not uh roller coaster ride excitement it's

38
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,760
really quiet and steady

39
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:20,759
so we can as we meditate we can be available to notice any kind of steady

40
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:27,360
happiness any kind of warmth that arises with the practice and we can

41
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:35,759
certainly appreciate the steadiness of of coming back to this again and again I mean it's wonderful that I've seen many

42
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:43,120
of the same names all week long and seen the same people in the afternoon sitting

43
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:50,120
that there's a steadiness of coming back to this again and again and sometimes we

44
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:57,039
can see as this what Gil was calling sweetness as this kind of bliss or kind

45
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:01,639
of steady warmth of happiness

46
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,960
arises and if that's not what's happening there can be some leap of

47
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,600
faith or trust or confidence that practice has worked so far in the ways

48
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,080
it has worked for you and that what we cultivate ultimately will grow so this

49
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:28,080
cultivation of samade will take us in the right direction it's going to take us towards freedom from dissatisfaction

50
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:35,600
stress and suffering we don't have to be so worried about what's AR what's already Arisen or that

51
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,400
we need something to arise the idea perhaps is to enjoy or

52
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:50,160
relax into what's already here and the way that it serves

53
00:05:52,080 --> 00:06:00,160
Liberation it's important um not to uh fall into treating this practice

54
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,599
as a grim kind of obligation or to get so hardened around it that we're pushing

55
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:13,400
pushing pushing um but instead to just relax see what kind

56
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,440
of uh qualities are there see when diffic difficulty is there don't shy

57
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,280
away from it meet it and appreciate that it's the mind showing us something

58
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,400
that's important to be healed to be seen

59
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:38,800
so simply noticing with kindness and appreciation whatever is

60
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,880
here and perhaps noticing a bit more today about what might develop in the

61
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:53,319
way of steadiness as we do the practice or as the practice does

62
00:06:53,319 --> 00:07:01,520
us so um settling into

63
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:15,960
meditation and the ways that you know bring you some relaxation some

64
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,520
ease understanding softening around things

65
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:29,919
that are present and are going to remain in this moment

66
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:43,680
bringing whatever appreciation is here for getting to do this practice in

67
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,360
this beautiful s of support around the

68
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:58,319
world of being able to come back again and again

69
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,759
and

70
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:20,960
grow appreciating whatever peace or calm is already

71
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:31,400
here even that the body is relatively still

72
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:40,569
encouraging the mind and heart to come to [Music]

73
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:51,040
Stillness and perhaps radiating or quietly whispering in the

74
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,200
mind appreciation for yourself for this

75
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,040
practice for all around you including this

76
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,560
s May our hearts and minds and bodies be well as we

77
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,920
cultivate these

78
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:33,320
practices may we enjoy the freedom from harm that's happening just in these

79
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,560
moments of sitting

80
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:58,079
together may we be peaceful

81
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:14,360
may we be free of suffering and appreciate the extent to which some

82
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,959
freedom is already

83
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
here for

84
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:11,240
gradually coming into the breathing to presence with the

85
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,800
breathing as it arises from the

86
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:27,040
quiet present as it courses through the body

87
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,800
and as it leaves the body following the entire out

88
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,279
breath appreciating the

89
00:11:51,880 --> 00:12:00,000
steadiness the reliability breathing in

90
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,079
and breathing

91
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:22,199
out if it's helpful to further steady the Mind by counting breaths or half

92
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:31,160
breaths one to 10 one: one Whatever method works for you in the peripheral

93
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,519
using the counting in the background to

94
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,730
support present awareness in the [Music]

95

here appreciating any quiet level of

104
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:10,520
[Music] Happiness even just the thought of

105

steadiness of the practice steadiness of the

breathing with some

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:22,000
appreciation perhaps appreciating any pleasantness that came with the comb

149
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:40,040
and radiating that appreciation to those around

150
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,560
us the steadiness of the presence of others in our

151

lives and how our well-being is so intimately

interl may we all be free from

theirs

00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:49,920
another appreciating the way we can be more and more free of

159
00:38:49,920 --> 00:39:00,040
suffering and radiate the wish to all beings around us may we all be free of

160
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:09,400
suffering may we care for one another to that end

[Music]

162

e

163
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:44,119
we can offer ourselves a lot of ease and steady calm

164
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:51,599
happiness in allowing ourselves these periods of time to be

165
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,599
untroubled to let the mind and heart rest

166
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,520
as we turn our attention towards this collected place of

167
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:10,040
steadiness and actually turn aside from

168
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:15,760
agitation busyness struggle consciously turning aside to

169
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:22,800
come to steadiness in this practice and there's such benefit too in

170
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:31,839
allowing ourselves to hang out with and appreciate any Pleasant feeling any feeling of

171
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:39,480
happiness it nurtures and reinforces our ability to come to

172
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:45,760
somadi to enjoy the freedom from

173
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,319
distraction and this learning that we can step aside from what is unhelpful

174
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:59,079
UNH wholesome unsettling and that's that's very

175
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:06,520
powerful actually leaning into or learning that we can turn towards what's actually helpful

176
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:14,000
what's Pleasant uh what's steadying and what brings somebody is a

177
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:20,960
superpower if you ever watched yourself as you took up a new sport or

178
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,800
skill um perhaps you noticed that tension didn't help so if you learned to

179
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,680
swim and you found that you were fighting or tense you'd learn that you

180
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:39,680
know you were more likely to thrash or sink or if you uh took up

181
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:45,839
skiing uh and the first time you fell you struggled mightily to get

182
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:53,200
up any number of skills that if we are fighting or for tense when we begin we

183
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,280
quickly learn that when we're able to relax it's so much

184
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:06,640
easier if you think of a hen sitting on her eggs she doesn't sit there and you know

185
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,760
urge the eggs to hurry up and hatch she doesn't fight with the process she

186
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:19,240
doesn't Peck at the eggs she just shows up day after day hour after hour and

187
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:25,240
nurtures the eggs with her body warmth we're nurturing this practice and

188
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,119
the steadiness of it in a similar way

189
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:36,240
so we'll we'll find that the practice will grow as we're able to take pleasure

190
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:43,880
in it as we're able to find something about it that we appreciate even if it's just a thought at

191
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:50,599
first today um as we practice again there's this opportunity to strengthen

192
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:59,040
mindfulness in daily life and perhaps one way today is to notice sources of

193
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,680
steadiness in you and in your life maybe from others noticing with appreciation

194
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:12,119
friends Partners colleagues who steadily show up who are there no matter how

195
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:18,119
things are going we very steady um and noticing what's

196
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:26,040
challenging what leads to a lack of subtleness what leads to upheaval is equally useful what the

197
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:33,440
things that show up that are tough are Pointers they are little Buddhas showing us the way that we need

198
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:42,480
to heal that we need to uh encounter ways we've conditioned

199
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,559
unhappiness so uh there's also the invitation to come back for a few

200
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:53,319
minutes at a time throughout the day to any sense of Stillness come back to the

201

breathing and to join uh the afternoon 20 minute sitting I'm offering on Zoom
