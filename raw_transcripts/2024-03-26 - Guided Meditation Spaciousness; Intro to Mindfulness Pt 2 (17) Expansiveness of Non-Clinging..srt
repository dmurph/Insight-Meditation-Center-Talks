00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:11,120
hello everyone and welcome and

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,640
uh so this week's theme is recognizing

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,760
the after effects or the benefits the experiential

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,160
benefits of letting go of release of non-

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,559
clinging and one of them is related to

6
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:41,000
a term that or an aspect of mindfulness that sometimes I like to

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,800
emphasize that being mindful is when we're mindful of

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,559
some we're giving room for that thing making space for it giving room to it

9
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,719
maybe we've all had some experience of being in a very crowded place where we

10
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,080
felt kind of hemmed in and then uh we go to some place where we feel like we have

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,880
lots of room and we can sometimes we call it bre having breathing room even

12
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,320
and uh and then sometimes within lots of room we can just relax and something

13
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:24,840
inside of us settles because when we're claustrophobic when things are kind of pressing against us um it's more

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,799
difficult to relax so part of uh mindfulness is to

15
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:38,280
make room give room breathing room to our breathing to our sense experiences

16
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,759
of in our body to our emotions even to thinking though that's

17
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,479
a little bit more tricky uh to give room for it is to not just give room for it

18
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:57,200
just to continue on kind of spinning out but making room

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,600
so that we're not fueling it anymore we're not not squeezing it out so if

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,039
we keep our foot on the gas pedal then the car will go faster and

21
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:16,599
faster but if we back off and make give room for the petal our foot is no longer

22
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:23,319
on the pedal and then the car slows down so it's like that we're thinking we

23
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:31,840
give room to it so that we're not uh perpetuating not not fuel in it

24
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,519
anymore so to assume a meditation

25
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,800
posture and there is a way of Sometimes using a

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,400
posture that makes us feel bigger so for those

27
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,920
sitting upright it's a sit a little bit more upright to sit a little bit more

28
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:06,799
maybe with the chest uh expand iive not pushing it outwards but uh letting it maybe by

29
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:13,080
pulling in the spine between the shoulder blades the chest comes out a little

30
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:20,239
bit or if you are um sitting in a with a back rest

31
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,360
sometimes putting a little pillow or something between the shoulder blades so

32
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,959
that again you get the same effect that something's being pushed out people who meditate in bed maybe can

33
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:38,159
do something a little bit similar um maybe there's something gentle that can be put between the

34
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,920
shoulder blades that allows the chest to expand a little more and also how we

35
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,159
what we do with the arms um you know that's an advantage

36
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:56,799
sometimes of meditating laying down is we can kind of open our our hands upwards have our eye hands to the side

37
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:05,480
sometimes and upwards and shoulders a little bit rolling back and it creates a little more sense of

38
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,879
bigness so we're beginning to feel our way into a sense of making

39
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:19,560
space having lots of room for what we're going to be with we have very little room when we

40
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,400
react to things and when we are bothered by

41
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,600
things so to

42
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:40,000
gently close the eyes and take some long deep

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,320
breaths with the in breath feeling how the body expands the

44
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Torso expands in some way rib cage

45
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,720
expands that we in a sense become

46
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
bigger

47
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:11,560
that sense of growing bigger on the in breath can

48
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,000
correct some fixed idea that limits us that keeps us kind

49
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,960
of shrunk or pulled

50
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,120
in feeling the lifting and expanding of the rib

51
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,919
cuge and and then keeping some of that sense of bigness or

52
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,600
largess and keeping it there as you exhale

53
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
relax

54
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,720
soften it isn't that the body is kept large

55
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:14,159
expanded with the exhale but the inner sensibility sense of our size can stay

56
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
big

57
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,800
and letting the breathing return to

58
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:50,199
normal and still as you breathe in

59
00:06:53,400 --> 00:07:03,000
to as you breathe in to feel the now smaller movements of

60
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,400
expansion in the chest in the rib cage maybe in the

61
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,280
belly maybe much more subtly in the back rib

62
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:35,000
cage and in and in the sensations of the rib cage

63
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:43,560
expanding maybe feeling there's lots of room for the

64
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,120
breathing to occur the breathing all the breathing

65
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,159
that's happening inside of the rib cage has

66
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:03,080
room the sensations of expansion and movement

67
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:09,080
filling contraction Letting Go

68
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:34,959
emptying then they continue with this settling process to feel the tensions you might

69
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,000
have in your face around the forehead the eyes the cheeks the

70
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
mouth if you have them there and as you

71
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,720
breathe imagine that you're making lots of room for those Sensations to be there

72
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,920
they're allowed to be there

73
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,560
spaciously

74
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:26,000
expensively and then as you exhale to let whatever tension you have

75
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,160
in your face relax relax outward into that

76
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
space

77
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,839
and then doing the same for the shoulders if you're aware of any tension

78
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,399
in your shoulders first see if you can readjust

79
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:23,160
the position of your hands your

80
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:31,320
arms to ease up a little bit of that tension

81
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,320
and then as you breathe

82
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:49,160
in to make room for whatever Sensations and feelings are in your

83
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:56,839
shoulder an expansive space spacious sense of there's room for those

84
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:05,920
Sensations to be themselves free of our judgments and

85
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,360
reactions and then on the

86
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:30,079
exhale to relax and soften the shoulders so the tension

87
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:39,600
expands into the space around them or dissolves into the

88
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,480
space and then on the

89
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:11,639
inhale to feel any tension or agitation pressure in the thinking

90
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,920
mind with the inhale imagining lots of

91
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:28,160
space there's room for your mind to be tense agitated it's

92
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,959
okay the inhale reminds you to have a wider

93
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,399
view of the space around the

94
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,760
tension giving

95
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
room

96
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:13,320
and then to relax the thinking mind soften the

97
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,440
thinking mind with the

98
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,800
exhale so the tensions

99
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:34,160
agitations dissolve evaporate into the space around

100
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,000
them and then to settle into the body experience of

101
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:10,519
breathing giving room space for the sensations of breathing as

102
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:17,880
you breathe in releasing letting

103
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:25,079
go as you exhale so that all

104
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,040
things expand relax outward

105
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,720
into the space around

106
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
you

107
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

108
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

109
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

110
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

111
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

112
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

113
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,039
whatever is happening for you

114
00:19:52,520 --> 00:20:01,519
now recognize it as such making room for for it to be

115
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:11,120
there taking the foot off the gas pedal making

116
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,240
space so we can relax

117
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:24,080
dissolve outward into the space around

118
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
it

119
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

120
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

121
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

122
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

123
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

124
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

125
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

126
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for

127
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
for

128
00:26:54,039 --> 00:27:00,240
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

129
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:08,080
to [Music] imagine all the space that's around

130
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,880
you beyond the edges of your

131
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:29,520
body that there is more space to hold all things your thoughts your feelings

132
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,720
your body in the spaciousness of the mind

133
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:43,000
that's as spaci as expansive and open as the space around

134
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:59,880
you and that any movement of tension of tightening up of grasping on

135
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,200
is a narrowing down a closing

136
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,240
in can even be claustrophobic sometimes when there's lots of thoughts and

137
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,960
feelings we're caught up

138
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:29,320
in and letting this simple awareness of all things

139
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,518
let that awareness be Broad and wide

140
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:45,279
spacious so there's room to be aware of other people in that

141
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:52,399
space we give other people lots of room to be who they

142
00:28:52,799 --> 00:29:00,039
are as long as they don't threaten us

143
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:07,720
or allow them to be in the spacious quality of the

144
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,799
art where it's a gift to be present for

145
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:25,240
others and making room from to be just as they

146
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,600
are they don't have to contend with our judgments our

147
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:38,279
agendas our preference preferences they can just be

148
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:45,159
there as they are and in that

149
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:54,158
spaciousness let there be a a channel room for Good

150
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:00,039
Will May all beings be

151
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,760
happy may all beings be

152
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,080
safe may all beings be

153
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,679
peaceful may all beings be

154
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:22,519
free and may my presence my

155
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:29,960
attention make room for that possibility

156
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:44,768
[Music]

157
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,360
thank

158
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,919
you

159
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,919
e

160
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,840
e

161
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:18,440
hello everyone and welcome and I feel delighted and have a

162
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:24,320
good fortune to for this theme this week to talk

163
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,840
about the symptoms of letting go

164
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:37,480
so the certainly we can become aware of how we cling and hold on tight and close

165
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:43,440
down and then there's opening up and the release of

166
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,600
clinging release itself that uh is part of the

167
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:55,240
possibility the potential of this Buddhist practice of mindfulness is more than just to relax

168
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:01,080
but to really find a sense of Freedom through through it one of the very

169
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,399
profound little sayings that comes from the Buddha kind of a summation of what's

170
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:12,080
most important he said nothing whatsoever is

171
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:18,200
worth clinging to he didn't say that nothing's worth

172
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:24,960
nothing is worthwhile at all he said nothing is worth clinging to the extra

173
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,760
that we do the holding on the resisting the pushing away that tightening up and

174
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:38,440
um and with enough clinging enough things we're attached to preoccupied with caught up in um the mind the heart

175
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:45,120
our very life can feel claustrophobic we can feel there's just too much going on just too much swirling

176
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,600
around sometimes it's so much that we can't get our bearing we don't even know what to

177
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,279
do and um I've asked people sometimes to notice the difference

178
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:03,919
between being CAU up in thought and then when they notice that they're in their

179
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,520
thinking and then they switch to being mindful of it this is what it's like to be thinking what's the difference

180
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:16,158
between those two states lost in thought and open and aware to what the thinking

181
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,520
is happening and some people report back that uh it they feel really small closed

182
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:28,280
in when they're caught up in thoughts that something almost goes dark becomes

183
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:34,398
Things become obscure but when there's this awareness of it the mindfulness of it there's an

184
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:41,200
opening there's a feeling of clarity and brightness that happens in the mind in our sense of

185
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:48,839
being and um and this points to how one of the symptoms of non- clinging is

186
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:54,000
space is room is a sense of expansiveness sometimes the mind can

187
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,040
feel very expansive sometimes a sense of awareness can feel

188
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,680
expansive sometimes the there can feel like as as if there's lots of room in

189
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:11,040
our body um like there's space lots of space for whatever arises can just be

190
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:18,440
there um in this ocean of space ocean of

191
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:24,920
awareness and so uh expansive state of being expansive state of awareness

192
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:31,640
expansive state of mind it is one of the symptoms that uh results of non-

193
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:37,520
clinging Letting Go release the kind of spiritual Freedom that Buddha

194
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,880
emphasized and so we can feel that we can begin tuning into it and the reason

195
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,680
for that to notice the symptoms of Letting Go symptoms of

196
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:55,359
relaxing is that um that reinforces uh our appreciation of that

197
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:01,280
allows us to notice more often and how it's there when we normally would have

198
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:08,839
overlooked it we would have not paid attention to it because the expansive state of being has no I don't know has

199
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:14,440
no monetary value you can't buy it um it's not about having some experience

200
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:21,160
it's not about our opinions it's not about our getting what we want or it's not about making ourselves

201
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:27,000
safe in a conventional ways but it's still it's people would

202
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,960
say it's Priceless it's invaluable um because in that

203
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,839
great spaciousness of Mind spaciousness of heart it allows makes room for some

204
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:44,560
of the most beautiful parts of who we are as a human being to flow makes room for some of most our beautiful

205
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:51,359
connections with other people to flow and when we lock down get caught get

206
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:56,920
tight and uh caught up in compulsions and addictions something closes down

207
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,960
something arrows something gets um lost in that

208
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,319
process so to notice the spaciousness to notice a sense of

209
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:14,920
expansiveness to make room for our experience and sometimes I've used that

210
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:20,560
as a kind of his own orientation for my practice the question how can I make

211
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,480
room for this and sometimes I wondered really

212
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:33,760
this too and then the mind says yes this too the practice mind says yes this too

213
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,359
make room for it and why one of the reasons to make room for everything make

214
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:47,040
space for everything to kind of hold it in the spacious mind is that the alternative is not good for us the

215
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,800
alternative makes the whole situ situation worse the alternative of closing down locking in resisting

216
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:59,520
tightening up getting narrow shrinking uh is a form of suffering is a form of

217
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:07,319
diminishing ourselves and so it's not the better alternative but being expansive

218
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:13,599
open um spacious with everything making room for whatever is

219
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,599
happening is just a fantastic thing to tune into and notice and

220
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:25,520
appreciate it can come with challenges some of the challenges are

221
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,680
that uh it can be frightening that uh there's a maybe a false sense of protect

222
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:37,720
of being protected if we tighten up and cling and resist and hold back but uh

223
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:43,839
we're not really doing ourselves a favor there's uh um and so sometimes we have

224
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:50,119
to deal with when we're more expansive and open it can feel like we're now more vulnerable it can feel like now there's

225
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:57,800
nothing protecting us but there was nothing really protecting us before if we're locked up in tense and have armor

226
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:06,240
on um we're actually harming ourselves and uh but to open up uh be be

227
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:13,079
afraid is one of the reasons why it's hard to do this but the art of it is to learn how to be

228
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:18,280
open um and not let the ordinary threats

229
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:24,520
around us that normally we closed down to let them affect us to let them touch

230
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:30,040
something for us to learn how not to react to them it's our reaction to some

231
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:38,160
of the things that are threatening things people say and do that's independent of any physical harm but um

232
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:46,480
that people say things to us then something inside of us locks up resists feels uh challenged feels

233
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,000
threatened feels hurt and sometimes that's reasonable but

234
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,079
sometimes it's extra it's not really needed and the and the D D that we're

235
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:04,359
that maybe we're think we're protecting ourselves from external danger um what

236
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:12,040
we really want to do is try to protect ourselves from the inner danger of shutting down closing up getting tight

237
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:18,560
so this idea of the expansiveness of non- clinging has its challenges um but uh it's a wonderful

238
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:25,640
challenge to have to explore and navigate um this new it's almost like a new territory learning a new language

239
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:33,359
and learning a new coming into to a new city and learning the territory it takes a while to learn how to navigate in it

240
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:38,400
but it's really worth it so one of the

241
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:45,760
signposts for freedom for release for non- clinging

242
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,359
non-grasping is a sense of expansiveness um sometime people call it

243
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:57,720
even uh a big mind since the Mind begs big or big heart the heart feels big our

244
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:05,319
presence feels kind of bigger and um and um to to appreciate

245
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:11,480
that to explore it to include it and not worry that it might be a sign of conceit

246
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:18,319
one of the reasons not to be expensive is some people are afraid if I do that then I'm too big I'm I take up too much

247
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:25,079
space for people and it's a sign of conceit or being domineering again it doesn't have to

248
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:31,920
be um it uh it might actually people won't feel us as being assertive they might feel us as

249
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:40,359
being now safer to be with more available friendlier Kinder so to

250
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:49,839
uh so if we let go a little we can maybe feel a little

251
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,319
expansiveness we let go more we feel more expensiveness let go let go of lot

252
00:41:55,319 --> 00:42:02,440
the sense of expansiveness can be quite quite spacious quite expansive maybe almost infinite in

253
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:10,280
feeling so um as you go through today uh you might see what it's like to

254
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:17,920
make give more room to your experience to whatever is happening can you make room for it can

255
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,280
you make more space for it can you allow it to be there in an

256
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:32,040
expansive receptivity or an expansive open openess um and then navigate what

257
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,359
happens as a result find your way with it become learn to be wise in that space

258
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:43,920
of an expansive mind expansive heart and um and appreciate don't don't

259
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:52,480
have a high bar for what expensiveness mean it can just be a little bit more than how you normally are or maybe it's

260
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:59,599
times when you feel most contracted that that's maybe the most interesting time to experiment given

261
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:06,040
this can I make room for being contracted can I make room for this

262
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:12,040
too so thank you very much and uh I hope

263
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:19,240
uh in the process of this that the this world of ours our shared world begins to

264
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:25,040
feel like there's lots of room and lots of space for us to be alive in to be

265
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,599
free in and to be ourselves in thank

266
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,240
you
