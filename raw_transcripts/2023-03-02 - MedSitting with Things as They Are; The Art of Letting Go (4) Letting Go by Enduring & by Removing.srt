1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,859
all right so let's go ahead and get started with our meditation together

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:15,660
just allowing yourself to arrive physically of course but also internally

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,199
for meditation

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,580
settling in to your posture whether you're sitting or lying down or maybe

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,099
you're even standing that's fine too

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,760
just having a sense of your body in the meditation posture

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,719
perhaps feeling the contact points here seed against the chair or the cushion

8
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:56,600
or whatever you're lying on your legs or feet against the floor

9
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,979
and just letting yourself feel that support

10
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,460
letting yourself be supported

11
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,159
and then sensing the straightness of the body sometimes really letting go into the

12
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:47,000
support gives kind of a counterbalancing upward release to the spine

13
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:54,720
letting the spine and the head just naturally Elevate upward

14
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,898
so that the body is both straight and relaxed

15
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,220
and seeing if you can tune into any sense of ease in the body

16
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:25,640
some part or area that feels comfortable right now

17
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,360
and maybe tying that sense of ease to the breath

18
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,940
so as you breathe in breathing into the ease in the body

19
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,920
and as you breathe out maybe letting it spread through the body

20
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:28,319
and if there are various thoughts happening in the mind that's fine they can just be more in the

21
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,519
background can bring into the foreground the sense

22
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,840
of the body and the breath

23
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:06,140
I'm tuning into any feelings of Stillness in the body

24
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,019
the body is a dynamic entity and there's always some emotion especially from the

25
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:19,560
breath there may also be a sense of Stillness at least overall the body is not moving

26
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,919
much

27
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,919
maybe feeling how the ease is related to the Stillness

28
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,639
so we may sense how the body provides

29
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,860
kind of a stable container for the breath

30
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,199
and also for various emotions or thoughts

31
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,380
the body can be the reference point the anchor and these

32
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:08,880
other things move around the natural seatedness and strength of the sitting

33
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,120
body

34
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:21,560
sometimes sitting is likened to being like a mountain

35
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,340
just there

36
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,360
while the wind and the Sun and leaves blow around the mountain just

37
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,740
sits there calmly

38
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:47,220
and then they sit you are invited

39
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:54,000
to remain with the body in this

40
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,639
Mountain state if you will

41
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,880
so that means not shifting around

42
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:14,280
not holding ourselves rigid but if there is some kind of discomfort in

43
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,800
the knee or the back or the hip or the shoulder

44
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,379
the first inclination would be to just let that be

45
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:30,620
like a little disturbance on the mountain

46
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,539
and just sit perhaps breathing through it

47
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,720
meditation teaches us not to unthinkingly react

48
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,519
and that includes automatically adjusting the body

49
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,399
so with complete ease smiling at the body just sitting if there's

50
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:12,320
some discomfort or an itch and how does the line deal with that

51
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,699
maybe there won't be anything so we need to create it

52
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:41,579
but feeling the deep rest of just sitting

53
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,880
still

54
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:15,680
it's always possible to turn the mind again toward the ease in the body

55
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,079
breathing into there and spreading that

56
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:53,579
and of course if there's a actual physical injury or a real sense

57
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:59,220
that there would be harm and of course it's okay to move

58
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:05,639
but we would do so slowly mindfully so I'm noticing the intention to move

59
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:14,100
and then gently moving and as we do so feeling how the whatever

60
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,660
pressure we were feeling slowly dissipates

61
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:39,260
it's also quite useful just to sit with things as they are

62
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:47,459
that is the practice to be with things as they are feeling your ears and the rest and the

63
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:53,959
beauty of chilling still

64
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,680
foreign

65
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,440
foreign

66
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:51,020
foreign

67
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,400
and if there is coming to be any sense of

68
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,080
inner Joy or happiness or

69
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:19,500
contentment it's fine to breathe into that and allow

70
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,120
it to spread into the body

71
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,460
acknowledging that sometimes happiness is part of things as

72
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,940
they are

73
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:58,820
feeling into any sense of peace

74
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:13,440
foreign combination of softness and strength

75
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:20,120
that emerge from just being with things as they are

76
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:28,140
if there's any hardness there will be Duke of there needs to be strength

77
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:33,799
so what is it like to have softness and strength

78
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:37,340
as we come to the end of this sit

79
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,320
perhaps taking a moment to reflect

80
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:50,940
how valuable it is for both you and for others to

81
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:57,659
have the sense of a mountain-like presence and posture

82
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:01,820
just being able to be there

83
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,820
sometimes what we encounter is Duke Eye and others

84
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,980
suffering in some way and in order to be helpful we have to be

85
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:21,120
able to be present sometimes their suffering is coming out in the form of

86
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,179
words or actions to us that are unwelcome

87
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:35,419
and again it's very helpful if we have some ease with being that

88
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:41,820
this kind of presence in the world keeps suffering from perpetuating

89
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:47,120
farther and it can even bring it to an end

90
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,720
and it's very well cultivated through our meditation practice

91
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:02,640
so it may be a day of softness and strength

92
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,720
in order that the beauty of the dorm room can be felt

93
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,280
[Music]

94
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,380
[Music]

95
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:05,279
okay so we're continuing with our series on The Art of Letting Go

96
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:14,700
seven practices that lead to letting go and yesterday we had the pair of using

97
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:22,799
and avoiding and today we have another pair that sounds like a big contrast like that

98
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:29,460
we have Letting Go by enduring and letting go by removing

99
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:35,700
so is there some active removal of things or is there a more passive

100
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:41,100
endurance of them and again we have some discernment about

101
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:48,299
that when do we hang in there and tough it out and when do we eliminate something that

102
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:58,080
is unwholesome or harmful so starting with what to endure

103
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,260
the teachings say what taints should be abandoned by

104
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,899
enduring here a person reflecting wisely Bears

105
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:16,980
cold and heat hunger and thirst in contact with gadflies mosquitoes wind

106
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:23,760
the Sun and creeping things and it also goes on to say various kinds

107
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,899
of pain we have so this one starts with various kinds of

108
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:37,799
discomfort after all we don't always have a choice in life about

109
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:45,840
what we have to endure and particularly with our body right these are about our body have you noticed how much of your

110
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,659
attention and energy go toward making things comfortable for the body

111
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:58,980
that's not inherently bad of course but it's also not so reliable and is it you

112
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:05,640
know that we're always going to be able to make it the right temperature and avoid

113
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,980
under and thirst and contact with things we don't want to touch

114
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:17,720
when I lived at Insight Retreat Center about 10 years ago

115
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:23,640
at that time there wasn't much control over the temperature in the building and

116
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:29,820
I really suffered when it was too cold and I tend to run a little cold and

117
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:36,299
um you know there were various mental machinations I could apply to that I

118
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:44,159
don't know if they really helped things like I'm supposed to be a good Buddhist and I'm supposed to just be mindful

119
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,880
um and then you know then the mind would just answer with no wait I need to care about myself and have compassion and it

120
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:58,740
should be like this and it should be like that um so I was enduring in a sense but there

121
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:05,820
was a little bit extra added by my mind let's say and eventually

122
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:11,760
I realized you know a very undramatic way that I was fine

123
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:18,299
actually I could handle the temperature variations and it really wasn't that big of a deal

124
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:25,799
so you know enduring and seeing the way the Mind tries to endure

125
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:32,880
but with a little bit of greed or aversion added onto it and then finally just settles down into

126
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:40,080
actual Equanimity um gives the confidence that this practice

127
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:47,059
of just being with something does actually work you know if if one actually uses mindfulness

128
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:53,820
it will eventually engender genuine Equanimity and not the false Equanimity

129
00:33:53,820 --> 00:34:01,380
of putting up with something and obviously it's not just grating your teeth and burying it that's

130
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:08,940
not what this is referring to it says enduring I don't know what other word we could use but it means actually enduring

131
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:15,060
in a way such that there's letting go and there is peace in the mind and body

132
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:20,580
just come to peace with how it is so these are practices that lead to release

133
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:25,858
and it's important as we go through the enduring process that we see how the

134
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:32,220
mind doesn't want to endure doesn't want to actually just have Equanimity and then it will eventually

135
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:38,700
settle down because there's duga in that extra that's added this is like the second Arrow teaching there is the first

136
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:43,919
Arrow of how it's not always easy for the body and

137
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,960
then there's the other ones we add on about I don't like it it shouldn't be

138
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:56,700
like this how can I stop it who's in who's responsible and how can I talk with them you know these kinds of things

139
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:02,280
um so life is definitely going to give you opportunities for this um

140
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:08,400
but we can practice with it deliberately also I remember one time

141
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,940
Gill coming back from a vacation he had been on where I think he was camping in

142
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:22,320
the mountains somewhere and uh by a mountain lake you know and those Lakes are often snow melt and you know I think

143
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:29,160
it was in the spring maybe and I said it wasn't it you know you didn't really go in the lake did you and he said mildly

144
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:35,640
it was cold for 22 seconds so clearly he had timed it

145
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:43,140
um so we can practice with this deliberately also at times in order to challenge our system

146
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:49,500
so um you know when we endure we get the chance to make the all-important distinction between unpleasant feeling

147
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,599
and wanted to go away those are different

148
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:59,820
and we contact also I said I'm looking at her mind we contact our relationship

149
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:07,440
to powerlessness you know how do you relate to having no control over something

150
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,540
that's actually a big one to work with so then you know one fruit of this is

151
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:19,079
that we gain the confidence that we can handle certain things which is important how is it going to be in the end when

152
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:25,859
you die you know when you get very ill and your body is not able to move or function properly

153
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:32,160
there may be very unusual feelings of that being able to endure them is good I

154
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,760
don't know it might be painful or it might not but it will certainly be very bizarre out of your normal Zone the

155
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,720
feelings that come dying so being able to endure that can allow a more

156
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:50,940
clear-minded death and then the the sutas also ask us to

157
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:56,820
endure besides the gadflies and the cold and the heat is uh it says ill-spoken

158
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:04,200
unwelcome words and those I know can be very hard to endure it's another area where we don't

159
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,240
have a lot of control though people say what they do even if we live our life

160
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:16,980
trying to be kind we can't guarantee that we're not going to receive ill-spoken unwelcome words

161
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:22,500
and you know how do we can we endure those or do we react and defend

162
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:29,460
immediately I know that's not easy the texts say that one of the best resources

163
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:35,640
for handling unskillful speech coming at us is mindfulness of the body

164
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,800
it helps I've found to literally put attention in the feet and stay grounded

165
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,079
if you can remember and another good way to do it is to expand awareness to

166
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,780
include the whole body and even the space beyond the body um

167
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:58,020
I remember venerable analio among saying that he was once in a conversation with

168
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:03,560
another Monk who was very angry that inalio had done some scholarly work

169
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:09,060
defending women having the opportunity for full ordination there is some

170
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:16,200
conservatism among monks that say that that shouldn't that shouldn't be allowed and and this one came and was very angry

171
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:23,220
with him and analio said he just sat there while the other monk attacked him in his work and he just focused on the

172
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:28,980
space between them and around them and eventually you know he didn't react and

173
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:36,180
eventually the other monk finished his tirade and left what else was there to do and so he he just stayed present with

174
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:43,220
it so it is important there are times when we will need to endure

175
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:51,300
so then there's also though the text also says that we can sometimes let go of things by removing and you know what

176
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:58,440
is it that we are supposed to let go of by removing generally they are unwholesome line

177
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,660
States so mind States agreed hatred and delusion we don't remove them

178
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:10,020
immediately though generally we would do it once we have investigated them enough

179
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:17,579
um there's a reason that this method comes fairly late in sequence I think we want to go with removing only when we're

180
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:24,420
very clear on what we're doing and how and why so basically we have to be careful not to mix a removal with

181
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:30,540
aversion which means it can be kind of an advanced practice it might be that we

182
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:36,300
have to endure for a little while and so that we have Equanimity and care when we

183
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:43,680
do remove um and also we'll see actually that removing can have a very gentle flavor

184
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,560
as well as a stronger one so we can maybe look at some examples

185
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:56,760
sometimes we do need to remove actively when the mind is in a really bad State like we would get a snake out of our

186
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:04,320
house but of course we'd do that carefully right um so if we can see and we're seeing was

187
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:12,180
the first method if we can see that the mind is repeatedly getting caught in harmful thought patterns you know maybe

188
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:20,880
we would try just having mindfulness at first and see if that works you know just noting anger or irritation but if

189
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:28,440
that doesn't work then there are other things we can try we can try redirecting our attention or we can try reflecting

190
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:35,339
on the difficulties that come when we have a wholesome line state

191
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:41,339
um or we could just kind of withdraw our attention from it that's kind of like the avoiding just waiting for the energy

192
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:46,980
to dissipate by being careful not to feed it it's a little bit like what an Alia was doing

193
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:53,780
and if all of that doesn't work then we have set ourselves up well to be able to

194
00:40:53,780 --> 00:41:01,260
firmly say to our mind know more of this no more of this and if we do that if we

195
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:08,960
do it too soon I think there can be a version but when it rises up out of genuine strength then it's compassionate

196
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,300
another teacher has said that we remove unskillful thoughts this way by saying

197
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,760
in our mind you will not get one more minute of my life

198
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:27,180
I mean do you have thoughts where they've had too many minutes of your life your life is valuable

199
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:33,720
why wasted thinking these terrible thoughts that are only harming you so it's like setting a boundary

200
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:39,960
you will not get one more minute of my life and there are other times you know when

201
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:46,020
removing can be so gentle we might get free of something by just applying

202
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:51,960
wisdom quite directly such that it dissolves there's a suta that

203
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:58,140
distinguishes it distinguishes using mindfulness to let something go and using wisdom

204
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:03,720
it actually sets up a series of conditions so first it says that maybe a

205
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,540
person just tolerates various unskillable mind States hardly even knowing that they're unskillful and it

206
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:16,740
says that that person is completely fettered I think about maybe how my mind was before I even knew the Dharma all

207
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:22,560
kinds of stuff ran through my mind and I never thought about whether it was skillful or unskillful or it was harming

208
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,660
me you're going to harm others I mean maybe I did sometimes but not a lot

209
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:33,780
so there's a lot of fettering there and then um there can also be the case where we

210
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:40,980
see with mindfulness and we see what's going on and we gradually are able to release through our practice of daily

211
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:46,380
life mindfulness that person is said to be on the path you know still fettered

212
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:51,540
like many of us but moving toward Awakening because there's mindfulness of

213
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:58,140
what's going on in the mind and then according to this suta there is a person who divests oneself from

214
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:05,160
unwholesomeness it's like it arises and it's just immediately quenched or maybe it's you know eventually even

215
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:11,760
doesn't arise so you know we're not always in such a clear wise state but it is good to know

216
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,400
that abandoning by removing can be just straightforward and gentle it doesn't

217
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,880
have to be some kind of a battle that's the the message I want to impart so

218
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,819
so we have Letting Go by enduring and letting go by removing and again there's

219
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:36,900
a matter of seeing which one is going to be effective we have to know something about what it means for something to let

220
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:44,819
go what does that feel like and then we can be then we can know whether a given method has worked and if if so great and

221
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:52,619
if not we might know have a sense of which one to try next maybe for those really sticky knots

222
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:58,260
we're going to need more than one actually probably we will so

223
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:03,300
we continue exploring this Art of Letting Go

224
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:12,020
and we'll continue with that tomorrow have a beautiful day or evening
