00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:08,040
hello everyone and welcome to IMC and this 7 a.m.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,480
teaching and was glad that inz could teach for me while I was gone on

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:23,000
Retreat and I'm very happy to be back with all of you and I very much thought about you

4
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,599
and this last week and I stayed focused on caring for

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:37,160
the treat that there wasn't much room for a second and I'm very

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,960
happy e

7
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,240
Okay so as usual when I've been gone for a while the

8
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,920
um I don't push all the buttons right so now I think everything all the buttons

9
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:19,120
and is set so

10
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,560
welcome and what I'd like to do this week uh is to go back to

11
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,560
basics and uh it's always a good idea to start over Come Back to Basics and build

12
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,920
the practice build our world from the basics so uh for the meditation at least what

13
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:49,640
I'd like to do is most basic is mindfulness of breathing and um and mindfulness of

14
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:56,400
breathing in the teachings of the Buddha comes along with three

15
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,440
steps number of steps but the three that I'll emphasize one is uh he says that as

16
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,959
one breathes mindfully and feels one's body one can calm the body calm the

17
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:18,879
bodily agitation and then he says that as we're breathing we can calm the mental

18
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,959
agitation calm the mind and

19
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:30,640
by implication it also is well let me say

20
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:38,760
it differently and the third thing he says that as we're breathing we can please the mind we can satisfy the

21
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,360
mind and one way that this happens is we can please the mind or satisfy the mind

22
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,000
or Inspire the Mind by a third form of

23
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,120
calming and that is we can calm mindfulness itself and calm the way

24
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,000
that we are aware as we know what's happening in the present we can know

25
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,720
calmly as we feel what's happening in the present we can feel

26
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:19,359
calmly the body and the mind might still be agitated but we can be aware of the

27
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,759
agitation with a calm awareness calm

28
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,199
mindfulness and this is the most B way to go back to to Basics not simply to be

29
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:40,320
with the breathing but as we're breathing to calm the

30
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:48,520
body the mind and then more deeply calm how we're

31
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,600
aware to such a point that it just feels good to be aware it pleases the mind it

32
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,160
satisfies the heart to be aware calmly

33
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,960
so to assume a meditation

34
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:11,400
posture an intentional posture so there's the regardless of what posture

35
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,520
you're in there's an engagement through the

36
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,120
body to be

37
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,479
present and gently close the

38
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,759
eyes and to connect to the B to the breathing more fully to establish a

39
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,160
connection to take a few long slow deep

40
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,000
breaths take a few long slow deep

41
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,360
breaths and relax on the

42
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:23,680
exhale in a easy way have a long slow

43
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:32,560
exhale to extend the time which you soften the body for

44
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:08,960
and then letting the breathing return to normal and for a few

45
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:19,080
breaths to allow the body to experience the sensations of

46
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:28,120
breathing maybe almost like a massage that the Torso expands and contracts

47
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,599
the belly expands on the inhale

48
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:49,039
and and if the belly doesn't expand on the inhale see if you can relax the belly

49
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:15,599
as you relax soften the

50
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:31,240
shoulders as you exhale soften in the chest

51
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,240
and maybe as you exhale softening in the face

52
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:16,600
and then as you exhale to soften

53
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:25,880
calm the thinking mind the energy or activation around

54
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,360
thinking let there be a soft

55
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,760
in letting go

56
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,640
a gentle calming calming wave through the body as

57
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,880
you

58
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,480
exhale almost as if the pull of

59
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,320
gravity gently

60
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,480
relaxes the muscles of the

61
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
body for

62
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:36,639
as you exhale or if you prefer the

63
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:45,079
inhale invite the mind to

64
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,839
Cal a calming wave through the mind

65
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:08,519
as if the mind too responds to the pull of

66
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:19,440
gravity to settle become stable quiet

67
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,959
and then as you exhale see if you can be

68
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:54,720
aware of the exhale

69
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,120
calmly a calm knowing

70
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,240
of the

71
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,240
body exhaling

72
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,560
calmly knowing

73
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:56,680
inhaling to know to be aware without pressure

74
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,319
without

75
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,880
strain each Act of

76
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:31,800
knowing a lightning lightning

77
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,720
up whatever heaviness

78
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,160
releases in The

79
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:02,040
Knowing using breathing or some other thing in the present

80
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:15,959
moment to be attentive to how you're aware

81
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:39,319
perhaps relaxing any sense of being the doer of

82
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,279
awareness if you're the can't do it

83
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:56,720
completely then be the allower of awareness making a room for awareness

84
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:09,480
to operate without being the Doer

85
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:46,680
perhaps each moment of awareness cannot be not to see it as the

86
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:52,480
end a punctuation of recognition of what is

87
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:59,360
with a period but rather the beginning

88
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:09,480
of an opening to a fuller recognition

89
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:16,959
recognition of what comes into awareness

90
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:57,080
calmly feeling what's happening not as the something to

91
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:04,120
conclude what's happening but as a beginning of

92
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,320
opening to what may arise

93
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:29,360
next to know and to calmly be available

94
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,480
to know what

95
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,760
follows for

96
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,080
what you're aware of may be

97
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:52,000
difficult but see if you can find a way to know the difficulty so the knowing is

98
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,640
calm tranquil knowing tranquil awareness

99
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

100
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

101
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

102
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

103
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

104
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,480
for e

105
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:45,799
in being aware calmly can you find a way to know feel

106
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:53,240
sense your experience that is satisfying for the

107
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,240
mind

108
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,000
that pleases your mind

109
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:37,840
perhaps because the awareness is very simple

110
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:47,679
ordinary not looking for anything special simply aware of what's

111
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,679
obvious awareness that's

112
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
peaceful

113
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for

114
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

115
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
e for

116
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,159
and and as we come to the end of this

117
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,000
sitting to

118
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:48,679
appreciate a sense of calm peaceful

119
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,080
knowing that teaches

120
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:02,240
us that agitation agitated

121
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,760
knowing will make the situation

122
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:17,480
worse that it's healthy and appropriate to remain with a calm

123
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:26,640
knowing as we address whatever challenges we find in this world

124
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:40,039
it's not worth abandoning a peaceful

125
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:53,880
mindfulness May our ability to be present calmly and

126
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:01,279
clearly support us to go into the world to work for the welfare and happiness of

127
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:07,880
all beings may all

128
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:14,360
beings be happy may all

129
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:22,639
beings be safe may all beings be

130
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:30,039
peaceful may all beings be free

131
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:40,440
and may we all contribute to this possibility

132
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:02,359
[Music]

133
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,960
thank

134
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
you e

135
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,639
so hello and welcome to this

136
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:25,559
Monday Dharma talk and for this week's series I would

137
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:32,120
like to go back to Buddhist basics the the very core insights and

138
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:38,200
understandings and practices upon which Buddhist life in the world is

139
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:46,360
built and um at the heart of Buddhism is addressing

140
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:53,440
suffering and The Core teaching that represents

141
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,120
this kind of direct clear eyed

142
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:06,320
seeing and working with practicing with suffering is the teachings on the Four Noble

143
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:14,000
Truth and uh classically it's called the described as uh the Noble Truth of

144
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,559
suffering the noble truth of the cause of suffering and the no Noble Truth of

145
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:26,480
the cessation of suffering and the noble truth of the path to that ending of

146
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,200
suffering and um and what I love about the way the

147
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:39,120
classic wording of this there are no pronouns in the wording of it so it's

148
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:45,559
knowing suffering wherever it occurs not chasing after it but if it's

149
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:53,039
in front of us if we're paying attention to the world we all account their suffering in ourselves and in

150
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:59,240
others and then uh understanding the causes of it

151
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,279
addressing the causes of it and one of the ways that Buddhism addresses the

152
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:10,480
causes which is somewhat unique to Buddhism is not necessarily fixing the

153
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:18,000
problems in the world but uh directly but knowing something about the root

154
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,360
cause of suffering that arises in the heart the Buddha called it a a dart

155
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:35,159
that's embedded in the heart that is possible to take out and so to um to discover what is it

156
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:40,919
that deep in the heart the the attachment the craving the clinging the

157
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:47,360
the dart that um as long as it's there that uh we will

158
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:53,760
suffer and this phenomenal capacity to take that dart out that no matter how

159
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:02,240
much we move the deck chairs and the Titan iic that the tanic will go down unless

160
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,399
and we better learn to swim we better learn to recognize these four noble

161
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:17,760
truths and how to work with them in our lives and um the um and so I'll be doing

162
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,358
this from the next four talks going through these four steps of the Four Noble

163
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:31,158
Truths but for today I would like to say that uh we have to be ready for that

164
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:37,599
that uh we shouldn't just jump into the four noble truths uh because it could be

165
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:43,398
misunderstood or understood the wrong way or because people are not ready and

166
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:52,679
so how are we ready for the four noble truths so that they are meaningful and impactful for us and maybe what I'll say

167
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:58,920
is not so that accessible but maybe uh it'll Inspire something for

168
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:05,119
consideration reflection for you so to be ready for these teachings

169
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,160
of the for Noble Truths there has to be Faith or

170
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:17,680
confidence maybe sometimes courage and um and what we have

171
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:25,000
confidence in what do we have courage about and that is we have to have

172
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,440
confidence that it's possible to pull the dart out of the heart it's

173
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:38,720
possible to feel to experience an end to what is

174
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,960
called dukka the PO word for translated usually as suffering which is not the same thing as

175
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:53,560
pain it's not the same thing as emotional pain but rather it's a form of

176
00:35:53,560 --> 00:36:01,640
distress a form of um uh a particular type of emotional

177
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:08,440
pain that uh has a cause it that can be eliminated be taken

178
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:15,520
away be let go of that it's a particular kind of distress particular kind of

179
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,440
suffering that has its origin in the reactivity in our own

180
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,599
minds and hearts so we're not trying to get rid of all emotional pain that would be

181
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:35,160
impossible but we are trying to find a way to meet all the pain of the world

182
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:42,200
with a heart that is not reactive that a heart that is not um caught up in

183
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:49,839
aversion or caught up in greed or confusion even and so to have faith that that's

184
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:58,760
possible to have confidence even courage that it's possible to find another way

185
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:05,480
than to be caught up in reactivity caught up in reactive distress caught up

186
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:16,040
in reactive hostility caught up in reactive um greed and and um fear to

187
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:21,480
what's going on here and now and that's a hard thing to have faith in it's hard

188
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:27,880
to have confidence both that it's possible and that it's worthwhile and it does some sometimes

189
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:38,040
take courage and one of the sources of this courage and confidence uh is to have enough

190
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,760
self-awareness to know how we make a situation worse for

191
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,200
ourselves to be able to track that as we encounter something in the world that

192
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:58,079
the very way in which we react is not required re if we react with

193
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:05,200
hostility is not really required to even if we have to act quickly and firmly

194
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,359
there's no need for hostility we can feel how that we deteriorate because of

195
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:19,318
it we add a level of emotional Pain by responding with hatred and

196
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:27,640
hostility uh with a lot of Courage we can see that uh if we react with conceit

197
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:34,560
with caught up in ideas of Me Myself and mine that uh it actually makes situation

198
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,839
worse it Narrows ourselves it limits ourselves it it divides ourselves with

199
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:47,640
others in the world and so know that there's an end of conceit end of

200
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:53,680
attachment to Me Myself and mine not that there isn't Me Myself and mine in

201
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:02,240
this world but it's the attachment to it which has caused so much suffering in this world someone has to learn not to

202
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:09,680
be caught by it someone should learn how not to be caught by hostility and greed

203
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:16,119
and someone should learn how not to be caught by fear and the Dharma the teachings of the

204
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:22,440
Buddha is that you're the one to do that work if you come to the Dharma that's

205
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:28,440
the offering that's the gift of the Dharma that's the in a sense the request

206
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,640
maybe of the Dharma heart is yes don't make it worse for ourselves because if

207
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:42,240
we do we make it worse for the world don't sacrifice the

208
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,319
good uh in addressing what is bad in

209
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:53,240
this world don't sacrifice what's healthy in you for

210
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:59,079
what's unhealthy in this world there are unhealthy things there are tremendous

211
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:06,240
forces of greed hatred and and uh delusion operating in this world but we

212
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:12,480
make it worse if we ourselves then respond with greed hatred and delusion

213
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,839
there's a world of tremendous clinging and attachment we don't have to be respond

214
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:26,720
we don't have to respond in kind the idea is definitely to respond

215
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,960
the idea is to be living in this world to address this hopefully they address

216
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:38,280
the suffering as I said the four noble truths do not have pronouns associated

217
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,680
with them the suffering of others is in a

218
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,920
certain way our own suffering and uh once we get clear and

219
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,560
and relaxed and have like go pull the dart from our own heart we're actually more acutely aware of the suffering of

220
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,200
the world but it's possible to be aware of it without

221
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:12,079
reactivity not to be passive not to do nothing but in order to be um an Agent

222
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:18,480
of Change there's a wonderful expression in poly that

223
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:26,000
um is a title in a sense of one type of person a role or way of living in the

224
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,599
world and um sometimes it's used as a name there are Buddhists who received

225
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:39,200
this from their teachers as their name but it's a wonderful kind of uh

226
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:49,040
um way of living and that's the word Santi Caro s a n TI which means peace

227
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:55,839
and Caro k k a r o means a maker so

228
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:03,760
Santi Caro is a maker of peace and um and how can we do this

229
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:11,720
being a become a maker of Peace for this world and one way is to never

230
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:17,000
abandon courageously avoid abandoning letting go of

231
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,680
forgetting the fundamental beginning of Buddhist

232
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:30,240
practice which is to have faith in confid confidence in it is possible to

233
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:39,640
come to an ending of distress an ending of Anguish an an

234
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:46,920
ending of reactive pain emotional pain it is

235
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,160
possible it is possible to find an abiding wonderful

236
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,920
feeling experience of calmly being aware

237
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,640
of this difficult world that we in and in that calmness some of the most

238
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:09,200
important and valuable and beautiful qualities of the heart can be with us to

239
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,839
address this world to meet the world with love with compassion with kindness

240
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:23,280
and care to meet it with honesty and directness and respect to respect all

241
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:30,640
beings so um these next uh days we will look at the four noble truths and

242
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:36,160
hopefully you come to a greater appreciation that um of how invaluable

243
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:43,599
it is to know the basic Foundation of where peace can be found

244
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:49,480
the simplest most direct route and least in the teachings of the Buddha and uh

245
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:55,880
and that you will have have faith in the value of the formable

246
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:02,800
truths that that you'll hear these with confidence yes no matter how little you can

247
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:10,119
practice them how little you can how little you can use them to see more clearly to that degree it's

248
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:16,800
beneficial and maybe you'll even have courage the courage to really take the

249
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:23,960
four noble truths all the way to their end that you too can find the end of

250
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:30,920
Anguish despair distress and the reactive pain that so many

people live in so thank you and uh I look forward to um coming
