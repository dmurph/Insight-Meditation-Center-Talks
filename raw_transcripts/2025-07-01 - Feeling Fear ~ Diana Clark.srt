1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,759
Welcome, welcome.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,880
It's nice to practice together, to meditate together.

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,840
So, I'm just returning from a teaching and meditation retreat. And for those of

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,960
you who haven't been on retreat, I'll just say that uh um everybody who participates has a

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,480
conversation with a teacher. usually more than one. So what that's the

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,360
retreats are in silence, but there's a particular time when you meet one-on-one with the teacher or in a group with the

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:47,600
teacher to talk about how your practice is going or questions you might have about the teachings or describe maybe

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,360
some difficulties or what's going well, this type of thing.

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,680
And it's not uncommon. I was noticing this. It's not uncommon for people who

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,960
are like maybe having a beautiful practice and they're unfold their their

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,159
meditation practice is unfolding and deepening in a way that we would expect.

12
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,680
That's, you know, not uncommon. But maybe they've like touched into a little

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,960
bit different experiences than they've had before.

14
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:29,600
for example, maybe just feeling settled and calm more than we usually are, more

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,840
than we can, maybe with just a a single meditation session. But you know, after you've been meditating, sit and then you

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,000
walk and then sit and then walk, the mind and the body, they can't help it. They just start settling down. And that

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,520
might feel unusual like, "Oh, wh what is this? I'm not used to feeling this calm

18
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,920
or this relaxed or this settled or this connected or this uh easeful. And it

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,920
might feel like am I still alive? You know, this feeling of maybe what we associate with vitality or passion or

20
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,280
something like this isn't there in the usual way or that that or we've become

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,879
so associated with just having this little bit of agitation. there's that thing I have to do, that thing I have to

22
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,400
take care of, this problem I have to solve. You know, the our life is like just one long to-do list. And when

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,400
that's gone, it can feel a little bit unusual

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,000
or sometimes what can happen as a this settling

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,760
happening then our sense of the body starts to be a little bit different.

26
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,840
It's sense our perception. Not always, but sometimes it can feel more spacious

27
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,599
and easeful and there's certainly we're in touch

28
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,120
with the body. We know what's happening, but it's less the anatomical body. It le

29
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,360
feels less like the body that's going to show up on a CAT scan or an X-ray or something like that. And it more just

30
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:09,280
feels like a collection of sensations that uh they're just there in some kind

31
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,080
of way. And for some people that feels like wait wait wait wait wait am I still here in the usual way or sometimes like

32
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,159
the maybe the head starts to feel really big or the pressure against the body starts to feel really strong or

33
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,360
something like that or maybe there's this way sometimes

34
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,200
there can be a feeling of energy moving through the body and uh in a pleasant

35
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,879
way usually but it's not our usual experience like oh what what's this

36
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:45,280
energy etic feeling that's going on. Some people report like a little bit

37
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,400
like their finger in a in a light socket.

38
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,519
It happens just to a small subset of people. But so I find in these uh

39
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,439
practice discussions that I'm having with all these practitioners that are on the retreat, I do a lot of like yeah

40
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:08,640
that's fine. It's absolutely fine what you're experiencing. But there's this way in which sometimes

41
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,400
there can be fear that arises when we're having new experiences. I'm talking

42
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:23,840
about them and meditation experiences that can arise when we're on retreat, but you know, just going to a new

43
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,320
uh any like new experience, going to a new gym, like okay, I want to look like I

44
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,240
know what I'm doing, but where are those machines that do the thing that I want? or where's those cardio machines that do

45
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,400
the things that I want or or going to a new grocery store and like oh where is

46
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,479
everything like I don't know this isn't like the usual one whatever it is maybe there's not fear at the grocery store

47
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:55,199
but just my point is there sometimes just when things are unfamiliar

48
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:03,199
sometimes there's a little bit of fear and so there's this way in which we can

49
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:12,800
practice with this in a way that can be a real support for our life that is maybe there's um

50
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,440
in the particular when I was talking about these meditation experiences there's a way that these meditation

51
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,120
experiences that I described are usually happening with this settling of the mind

52
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,199
and the body which generally is a pleasant experience.

53
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,560
It's nice to feel some at ease and some settling and some collectedness,

54
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:44,400
but then as I said, there can be some fear. And then as soon as there's a little bit of fear, it kind of like hijacks our attention

55
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:53,120
away from what otherwise is a pleasant experience. Might be a little bit unfamiliar, but it's pleasant.

56
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,520
And so one thing can we do and this is a practice is to just learn can we orient

57
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,240
can we incline the mind can we orient towards that which is pleasant

58
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,000
that which is feels like spacious or feels I'm using these words

59
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,120
collectedness or steadiness maybe there's a sense of warmth too maybe

60
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:25,280
there's a feeling like oh the heart isn't so constricted and tight or the mind isn't running around quite as fast.

61
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:32,880
So when the fear is just a mild fear and it's happening

62
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,080
at the same time there's something pleasant. This will be a practice. It's

63
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,120
not something we can automatically do. But a just to acknowledge both of these

64
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,800
things are happening. And can we intentionally incline towards the

65
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,759
pleasant and then our capacity to be with discomfort and unfamiliar just grows

66
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,160
will continue. So we're not ignoring the fear. We're

67
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:09,599
not pretending like it's not there. We're just not letting it take over.

68
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,880
But of course there are times when fear in other situations is stronger when

69
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,360
fear is really has a big pull on us.

70
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,919
And so what can we do then? What are some of the ways we can be with fear? Whatever ways it's showing up in our

71
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,440
lives. I'm generally not talking about the fear that's there with imminent

72
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,720
danger. You know when we see a car coming towards us right and we have to get out of the way. I'm not talking

73
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,160
about that. I'm talking about the fear that arises often from worries we have

74
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:51,440
about the future or the fear about you know our health or somebody else's

75
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,800
health or something like this. So when that type of fear is arising how

76
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,000
can we be with that in a way that feels like it's supportive with our life in a

77
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,280
way that again we're not pretending like it's not there. We're not ignoring it. We're not suppressing it and but we're

78
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:18,240
not letting it push us around so much. What can we do? We can investigate it. H

79
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,840
fear is here. What is fear?

80
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,919
Like what is the experience of fear? What is the sensations this collection

81
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:37,039
this constellation of experiences that we assign the label fear?

82
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:43,599
because I had a uh I was there was a time when uh I had just some medical

83
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,920
condition which my heart would beat faster. It turned out to you know be fine. I eventually just figured

84
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,839
everything out and got stuff stabilized. But before I knew that I'd be I remember

85
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:03,360
this in particular giving some talks not dharma talks but some talks in different settings and I would feel my heart

86
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,640
pounding. I'm like, I'm so nervous and like what can I do? And I was feeling like I why am I so nervous? And then I

87
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:17,120
could just see like my confidence kind of seeking sinking. Like I thought I was prepared, but I'm so nervous. And then

88
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,680
when I started to speak, my heart was pounding. And then I just thought like I don't know. I could just my sense of

89
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,200
myself started to all this doubt came in. Do I not know how to talk or give a

90
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,800
talk or what's happening? And it kind of did not go so well.

91
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,240
But it turned out to not be fear. It was just my heart having a faster heart

92
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,880
rate. So even things that we assign fear doesn't mean that they're actually fear.

93
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:54,800
But those things that were those collections of experiences that we're assigning fear, we can investigate them.

94
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:02,080
What is the bodily experience? Maybe there's pound, maybe the heart is pounding and going fast. But chances are

95
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,360
maybe there's like a clenching in the gut or sometimes for me there's like a

96
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,120
lump in the throat or something when I'm afraid. And also there can be a sense

97
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,720
like the body wants to move doesn't want to just stay there. It wants to do something. So there's this sense of

98
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,920
restlessness uh in the body. And we can also notice that there's this thoughts

99
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,720
like they um the the quality of them is like they have a certain pressure and they're going fast and maybe are blurry

100
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:40,880
and blurry what you know like not so distinct. And the content of them is all about

101
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,560
like what might happen. Not what's happening right now but what

102
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,160
might happen in the future. What's going to happen? Or it's like what does it

103
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:59,040
mean about me as a person? You can say when that little anecdote that I told about uh when my heart was

104
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,040
beating fast I started to have all like all this what does this mean? Does this mean I don't know how to give talks?

105
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:12,399
Does this mean that I'm not prepared? You know there's this way in which we our sense of self kind of gets uh

106
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,920
brought into it when often and that sense of self takes the form of thoughts

107
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,640
when we are having fear. So there's bodily sensations, there's thoughts about the future and thoughts about what

108
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,920
this means about us as a person. Usually those thoughts are they're not clear to

109
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,959
us. It's just a collection that's happening.

110
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:41,920
And the third thing that's often happening is there's a shrinking awareness. It's like, oh, we just come

111
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,160
so concerned about this whatever it is we are afraid of. We kind of aren't noticing

112
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,440
the bird singing or the sunshine or the feeling of the chair against our body if

113
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:01,519
we're sitting down or who's in front of us necessarily. We aren't noticing much else except what we're afraid of. And

114
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,279
there's this way that this kind of constriction it's kind of unpleasant as opposed to

115
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,320
just this relaxed openness and this relaxed awareness.

116
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,360
That's a third thing or this kind like shrinking awareness. And then a fourth

117
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,959
thing of course is all the aversion we have. We don't like it. We don't like

118
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,560
the bodily sensations. We don't like having those types of thoughts. We don't like the awareness being restriction

119
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,760
being restricted. I don't like it. Make it go away. What can I do to get rid of

120
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:41,440
it? So all this is in the mix when there's a sense of fear and we can bring our

121
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,279
attention to any of it. All of it.

122
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:54,519
The point is can we be present right now with the experience?

123
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,560
Because bringing mindfulness to any aspect is helpful. Because what happens

124
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,240
when we start to have this sense of fear, but we're able to just uh notice a

125
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,279
sense of confidence grows. It's like, oh yeah, this is

126
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:18,480
uncomfortable, but I can I can handle it. I can be with it.

127
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,920
And with this confidence, of course, the fear diminishes because implicit in fear

128
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,519
is the sense of I can't handle it. I won't be able to handle it. This will be

129
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,959
uncomfortable, terrible, horrible, be awful in some kind of way and I won't be able to handle it. Otherwise, we

130
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:43,279
wouldn't be fearful. Right? So there's this way in which confidence develops

131
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:50,480
by just being mindful as best we can of any of these aspects of the fear. Bodily

132
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,800
sensation, thoughts, shrinking awareness, aversion. There's four things. You might find something else

133
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,120
that's happening to you. It sounds, you know, like, oh, that

134
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,399
sounds like a good idea. But it's not always so easy to do, right? When we're

135
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,519
in the midst of fear, of course. Of course. And that's why when we have

136
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,800
fear, when we notice we're having fear and really mild, unthreatening

137
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,720
situations, just mild because we're in unfamiliar situations, it's helpful. Can

138
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,120
we just tune into that fear? Or can we tune into any pleasant experience that's

139
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:40,560
happening with it? That also builds confidence a way in which increases our capacity to be with the fear.

140
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,920
So notice how I didn't say

141
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,920
do whatever you can to get rid of it which is our usual response right to

142
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,360
fear like the we have this aversion. we don't want it and then we're maybe we're

143
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,279
trying to like solve some problem or figure it out or get mad at it or lash

144
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:09,519
out at people, lash out at ourselves. I'm a terrible person. I shouldn't be afraid of this. You know, logically

145
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,279
there is no reason to be afraid of this.

146
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:21,519
There's this way that uh maybe wanting to avoid it or make it go away. So this

147
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,199
is aversion which turns into avoidance or turning it or this sense I I have to

148
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:33,920
fix it. Both of those, the fleeing and the fixing, the wish to flee, the wish

149
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,639
to fix, both of those turn out to just be things in the mind usually. Sometimes

150
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,160
we're jumping up and actually doing things. But yeah right right now I'll

151
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:53,519
talk about what's happening in the mind that there's this way in which we are like in

152
00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:00,880
uh injecting more and more thoughts into the thinking apparatus. We're already

153
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:07,279
having this thoughts about well what does it mean about me as a person and things about the future. So some ways

154
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:13,120
we're disconnected from oursel and then the way in which we try to fix or flee

155
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,120
the situation turns out to be more thoughts. So then we are just in our

156
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,240
mind with lots and lots of think thoughts and we're disconnected from

157
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:31,759
what's actually happening. What's actually happening probably

158
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:38,720
uncomfortable but not actually threatening. If it is threatening, then do whatever

159
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,759
you can to, you know, get out of uh harm's way. Absolutely. Right. Of

160
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:50,240
course. Don't know when the car is coming, when the bus is coming straight towards you, don't think about, oh, how

161
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:58,560
does this feel in the body? Of course not. So is there there's this way that the

162
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,640
aversion actually perpetuates and often increases

163
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,760
the fear because it's adding to that element of

164
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:18,240
thoughts. That's an aspect of fear. The more aversion, the more fear.

165
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,319
Less aversion, less fear. They go together.

166
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:33,280
This is really helpful to keep in mind that the more that we're trying to push it away, the stickier it gets.

167
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:40,160
This idea of the Torah baby, right? This uh I don't remember the story exactly, but this is what I do remember is that

168
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,600
there's this sticky uh something sticky and then you want to get rid of it and

169
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,760
you push your hand towards it and it like, oh, it's uh um I can't get rid of it. So then you put the other hand and

170
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,679
then oh no and then both hands get stuck and then you know the left foot the right foot and then you're right you're

171
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:04,799
just completely stuck with this stickied thing fear in fact I would say

172
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:11,200
even all experiences are the same this is such a key

173
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,480
um key recognition but of course you don't have to take my word for it please

174
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,400
don't just take my word for it find this out for myself explore this

175
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,039
what happens if I just if I orient towards my bodily

176
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,880
experience maybe it's unpleasant but it's happening right here in this moment

177
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,799
I'm taking um energy away from the thinking disrupting the momentum of the

178
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:48,080
thinking maybe even orient towards intentionally orient towards a neutral bodily experience

179
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:55,039
towards something that's there that's happening but uh isn't uh fueling that

180
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:04,919
and you'll discover as the aversion goes down the fear goes down I'm yeah

181
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,440
there's also this way in maybe some part of what the these thoughts are the way that we're judging ourselves thinking

182
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,840
that we shouldn't do this so just note that too like in this collection of thoughts there's this

183
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:24,200
whole bunch of um that are turn out not to be so helpful.

184
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:32,080
And there's a poem I like to read here that uh of course it's by Rosemary Tramer. She's one of my favorite poets.

185
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,240
I read her poems often. And uh the name of this poem is called

186
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,679
Moose Musculus, which happens to be the Latin name for mouse.

187
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,320
This is Moose Musculus by Rosemary Tummer.

188
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,559
Today, fear is a mouse that scuttles between thoughts and feeds on whatever

189
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,760
it finds. Nibbles on my certainties, gnaws the

190
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:08,960
coating off my circuitries, and pulls the stuffing out of each moment.

191
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:15,360
Those arts droppings in the hallways of my mind. I thought it was worse when fear was a

192
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:22,000
tiger, a badger, a wolverine. But the mouse of fear finds its way into

193
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,080
everything. Makes nests inside my minutes, discovers

194
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,520
passages into my inner walls, then scratches against them at night.

195
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,720
It never goes near the traps I've set. No, it scampers around them. Its soft

196
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:48,120
feet pattering its smart its small dark eyes noting everywhere I go.

197
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:56,559
I love this line there. Those are its droppings in the hallways of my mind.

198
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,159
This way that you know just finds its way in. And I'm pointing to you how a

199
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,080
lot of this is in our mind. And so can we orient towards something

200
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:16,320
else? But I want to unpack this a little bit more about some of these thoughts.

201
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:23,280
So the there's a thoughts often are about the future as I said

202
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:30,400
an example like what what will happen to me maybe in general or specific

203
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,600
like we might have like these vague notions of unsettledness like uh am I

204
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,960
going to be okay in the future? Will I be all right

205
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,320
in the future? Will it turn out okay? What what will it go wrong? go poorly,

206
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:53,039
go badly, what might go wrong or maybe there's this way and on this on

207
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,039
our for our physical well-being, our emotional well-being,

208
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:06,799
maybe even our survival, right? Will I have enough enough money? Will I have a

209
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,000
place to live? I mean, these types of things in terms of security or

210
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,280
relationships or possessions, right? Of course, we have these types of fears.

211
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:26,080
Have this uh this fear that we won't be okay. We have this fear that we won't be

212
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:34,720
happy, that there won't be well-being. This is normal.

213
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:41,360
Humans have this. But is fear. So having those then

214
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,880
reacting with fear. But fear tends to push us around and

215
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,240
try to convince us that we should distract ourselves or that we should I

216
00:22:52,240 --> 00:23:01,679
don't know some avoid our things. But what is it that helps

217
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:09,200
increase the likelihood that there will be well-being, that there will be security, that there

218
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,960
will be happiness. We have this fear that there won't be

219
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:22,400
but what can we do that will increase the well happiness well-being

220
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,679
and that is cultivating qualities of the heart

221
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:34,159
cultivating qualities of the mind those that are helpful and skillful and

222
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:40,480
useful of course we know this I mean dharmat

223
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,120
talks are all about this so often. But there's this way in which we like Yeah.

224
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,559
Yeah. I know that mindfulness would be helpful. Yeah. Yeah. I know that

225
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,159
cultivating some warm-heartedness, some mata or loving kindness or some

226
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:05,360
compassion is helpful. Yeah. I know that generosity helps uh support a sense of well-being,

227
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,720
helping others, helping ourselves or Yeah. Yeah. I know that equinimity is a

228
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,400
good thing to actively cultivate and like we all hear about this and yet we

229
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:24,320
often aren't doing it in a way that's kind of be impactful

230
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:31,200
in a way that uh really helps create the foundation for us to have well-being and

231
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:38,159
the happiness in the future. There's this way in which because it's

232
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:45,360
an we aren't putting the investment in now that can help ensure a future that will

233
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:52,320
have bring some ease and well-being so that we'll have less fear about the

234
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,919
future. Because when we cultivate these

235
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:05,840
beautiful qualities, they bring happiness. They do. They bring a sense of well-being.

236
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,880
Whether this is mindfulness, which is what we're doing here. Sometimes I've talked a little bit about meta practice.

237
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,960
Maybe I'll bring some of that in. But equinimity or um generosity or

238
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:27,799
compassion or some of these this old this whole uh host of inner qualities.

239
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,320
So this is how we take care of the future instead of just having fear about the

240
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,600
future is to invest in these qualities.

241
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,320
Paying attention to our mindfulness and daily life. Can we bring some kindness

242
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,760
to our interactions to others? Importantly, can we bring some kindness

243
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,440
to ourselves? There's this way in which the inner

244
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,360
critic just kind of like just running the show so often pushing us around. But

245
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:09,520
what would it mean to say, you know what, I'm really gonna work with the inner critic

246
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,039
in a certain, you know, like in a committed, diligent or intentional way

247
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:21,039
or I'm going to work with mindfulness in daily life, not just as part of a meditation practice or I'm going to work

248
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:27,840
with cultivating some warm-heartedness so that it becomes more and more the

249
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:36,400
orientation or the um maybe the inner mood food or something like this

250
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,640
because there's a way in which when we do this then the future starts to unfold in a

251
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:50,159
certain way differently and even if some of those things happen

252
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:57,039
of uh well will everybody like me and will I be uh okay

253
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:04,640
even if some things don't go exactly how we wanted them to and let's be honest how things do go exactly as we want them

254
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,559
to, we'll be okay. We'll be okay.

255
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,799
So, I'm not saying that we don't have to take care of our livelihoods and plan for the future. I am not saying that. Of

256
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:24,000
course, we have to do that. But can we do that as a way of care

257
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,520
instead of fear? And is there a way that this uh when

258
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:37,360
these all the worries that tend to have such a

259
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:44,400
big impact on us and influencing so many decisions that we make?

260
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:51,279
Is there a way that we can create the conditions in which those worries just start to diminish and instead we're just

261
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:56,640
focusing on cultivating our inner qualities and noticing the relationship

262
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:04,240
that we have to the present moment just tuning in. Are we meeting right now this

263
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,559
experience with openness? Are we meeting this experience with

264
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:17,520
curiosity, with mindfulness? Are we meeting this experience with

265
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:24,240
kindness? As best we can, as best we can. I like to slip that in

266
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,440
there because it's so easy how the inner critic can like, oh yeah, I'm not open

267
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,799
or mindful or kind. And there was that time when I got really irritated with

268
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:40,640
the driver and who was going 25 miles an hour in the 50 m per hour zone or

269
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,840
something like this whatever it might be. So as best we can

270
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:54,360
and so this is something that actually makes a difference.

271
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:04,240
Cultivating some of these qualities really helps uh the us have a future

272
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,760
that doesn't that the not only does the future different but

273
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,440
our worries about the future start to diminish

274
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,799
and there's this way that we have a some some people might have like an

275
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,240
investment portfolio like okay you know I want this to grow as I age, you know,

276
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:34,000
this type of thing. Often that's associated with money, stocks and bonds or whatever. But is there a way that we

277
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,960
can also have an investment portfolio for our inner life too? Can we invest in

278
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:48,440
mindfulness as we do here or warm-heartedness?

279
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,960
And there's lots of resources. It's there is an embarrassing amount of

280
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,960
resources on audiodharma.org as well as you know there's so many apps

281
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,080
and books and YouTube videos all these kinds of things so

282
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,640
I have to wait

283
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:28,480
excuse me sorry about that but what would it be like to just say you know what I am going to invest in something

284
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,720
whatever feels like I don't know feels rich for you whatever your intuition

285
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:41,039
suggests or something like this and the way to have then will there'll be less

286
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:48,799
fear in our lives and I kind of like this idea that uh I I

287
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:54,000
was talking about how aversion increases

288
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,039
fear aversion towards anything but aversion towards spirit, for example. But what if we bring warm-heartedness to

289
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:06,159
our experience? Warm-heartedness is the opposite of aversion. And so these

290
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,440
unpleasant experiences just go down as we bring warm-heartedness, loving

291
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:18,000
kindness, compassion, openness, even curiosity to them.

292
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,279
So this way of considering the way that we are just in our daily life as a

293
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:30,159
support for our futures as an investment for our future also so there's less

294
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:36,159
fear. So maybe I'll just

295
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:44,080
read this poem again because there's a way in often that we're just not aware the impact that fear does have in our

296
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:50,799
life. our our fear about the future.

297
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:56,799
So this poem is Moose Musculus by Rosemary Tramer.

298
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:03,279
Today fear is a mouse that scuttles between thoughts and feeds on whatever

299
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:10,720
it finds. Nibbles on my certainties, gnaws the coating off my circuitries and pulls the

300
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,399
stuffing out of each moment. Those are its droppings in the hallways

301
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:23,840
of my mind. I thought it was worse when fear was a tiger, a badger, a wolverine. But the

302
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:30,000
mouse of fear finds its way into everything.

303
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,600
It makes nests inside my minutes, discovers passages into my inner walls,

304
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,559
then scratches against them at night. It never goes near the traps I've set.

305
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:49,360
No, it scampers around them. Its soft feet pattering its small dark eyes

306
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,640
noting everywhere I go.

307
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:02,000
So making an investment into wholesome qualities as a way to not only in the

308
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,679
present moment diminish the fear but also take care of those thoughts about

309
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:15,559
the future which are so often laced with fear. So, thank you.

310
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,640
With that, I'll open it up to see if there are any comments or questions

311
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,720
about uh what I said here tonight. I talked about like wholesome qualities,

312
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,679
but I didn't really go into depth about any of them. So,

313
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:42,399
my apologies about that, but chances are you know a lot about them.

314
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,600
Yeah. Can we We'll use a microphone.

315
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:05,120
Thank you, Jim. I um I was just wondering if you could

316
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:13,399
um repeat what you said about cultivating

317
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:19,358
um was it wholesomeness or was it that whatever was skillful helpful that the

318
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:26,000
things that that if you cultivate them help with reducing the fear one piece of

319
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,638
that again and what those what that is what does that look like when you're meditating or what does that look like

320
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,760
otherwise? What does that mean? Yeah. Yeah.

321
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:45,040
So mindfulness if we bring mindful to an experience of

322
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,638
fear as I was just talking about then we'll notice that there's bodily components and mental components and

323
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:58,800
aversion and this but there's this and let's say this um so we notice that

324
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,119
there's this constellation and then there's this aversion to it but if we bring mindfulness to his mindfulness

325
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:11,680
isn't aversion And the aversion is is fueling the fear.

326
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,960
If we bring in something that isn't uh aversion, then it the fear goes down. So

327
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:26,079
that's one thing in which in the present moment when the fear is there, we can work with it. But not only that, just

328
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:34,160
cultivating the capacity to be with fear in an example um helps us to meet

329
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,920
everything in the same way. And then our life unfolds in a way that's not being

330
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,320
dictated by fear. And these qualities help create

331
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,000
more openness, more

332
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:58,960
ease, more happiness. Does that make sense? It's a little bit ciruous. Yeah, I could

333
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:05,079
see why you were asking this question. Thank you.

334
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,640
Does anybody else have a question comment?

335
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,839
And maybe I'll just throw in something here too. If we look at our fear, it's so much about the future. So I could

336
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:25,760
have just done a talk about how to take care of your future, cultivate these

337
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:32,160
wholesome qualities, openness, warmth, mindfulness, compassion.

338
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,560
I could also done a talk of like how to meet fear in the pre present moment. It's the same type of qualities very

339
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:44,079
often. Mindfulness in particular,

340
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,520
loving kindness maybe. Yes. Yeah. Can we can we use that microphone

341
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:56,720
please? Uh you were talking about um having um

342
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,920
negative experiences maybe fear um negative thoughts and pu we want to push

343
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:11,680
them away. Um, it's true and but I wonder because when

344
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:18,240
I have negative thoughts often what I do is bring myself back to the present and

345
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:24,000
is that the same as pushing the pushing them away or you know that was well

346
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,599
maybe I'll ask you a question. When you say come back to the present what what does that mean? Oh I might focus on my

347
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:35,920
breathing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I would say that's not the same as pushing them away. Like like you're aware the

348
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,760
thoughts are there, chances are, but maybe they're more in the background and the breath is more in the foreground or

349
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,680
something like this. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. pushing them away is a way in which what

350
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,359
I'm talking about is like a it's I'm going like this with my hand like a shoving them down and repressing them

351
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,400
and there's a way in which uh a thought can come up and we just immediately

352
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,440
distract ourselves and the distracting turns out to be enormously effective

353
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,680
that we like oh I'm no longer have that but what when we're just turn towards the breath that's just bringing to the

354
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:17,280
present moment experience and the thoughts don't disappear.

355
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,880
They just they come back. They come back, but maybe they're less authoritative or not pushing you around

356
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:32,320
as much or and not even as troubling or bothersome. They're might be unpleasant, but they don't have as much

357
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:41,160
momentum or I like this word authority. That's going to give to Bill here.

358
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:51,200
So if if I really dislike fear, I I can handle just about anything else. Um

359
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,240
rejection, loneliness, disappointment, that's all fine or I can work with that.

360
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,280
But I really don't like fear. Um it's very uncomfortable for me. But but when

361
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,839
it comes up and if if I'm fearful of someone

362
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:14,000
then it's I I don't just look at the fear

363
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:22,720
that's too uncomfortable. So I kind of do a little side step or jiujitsu move. Um put my attention

364
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:30,960
somewhere else. So, what I've done a couple of times that helped was to do loving kindness practice for many people

365
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,760
that I know. And um and then I put it off as long as I can, but after I've covered everyone

366
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:46,480
else, I'll do loving kindness for the person I'm fearful of. And um you know,

367
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,320
it helps a lot. You just feel better afterwards. Excellent. Much less fear,

368
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,720
actually. Excellent. It's one of these wholesome qualities we can cultivate is loving kindness. It's kind of a trick. I

369
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:05,440
I don't feel like I'm cultivating something worthwhile in me. I'm just, you know, kind of doing what I can. But

370
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,960
but it does help. Yes. Right. Opening the heart, softening the heart. And it's

371
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,079
also right. It's the anti-version. And it's the aversion that kind of really

372
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:23,440
fuels and make the fear bigger and bigger. It's interesting to me that you started by saying I really don't like fear. Just

373
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:31,440
being honest. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I don't think anybody likes fear. It's uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable.

374
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:38,079
But maybe I'll just offer one thing also is that if you wanted you could just be with the bodily experience like oh what

375
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:44,079
what is the bodily experience of fear? And then just to be with the body experience and let the thoughts just

376
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,680
kind of take care of themselves and just be with oh yeah the a beating heart

377
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:56,480
feels like this lump in the throat feels like this something like that. When is fear? That's advanced practice Diana but

378
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,838
I'll work on that. Yes I will. Thank you. Thank you Bill.

379
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:16,720
Um, would you say there's uh like counterpoint

380
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,880
emotions to fear kind of like

381
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,960
like when if we dig around in our fear or like engage our fear

382
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:36,240
kind of mle through it able to like embrace embrace and just be one and

383
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,280
be okay with our fear? Would you say that there's like counterpoints

384
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:49,200
that are cuz you call it like a negative emotion like the downsides of been with

385
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:57,280
fear? Oh, I'm not sure. I don't understand the word counterpoint. I guess what I'm saying is that maybe fear isn't so bad because there's probably

386
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,960
something on the other side of it. Oh, very nice. Yeah. Yeah. I would think

387
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,960
like maybe joy or maybe even ecstasy.

388
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,880
I see. I'm not sure. I think I think if we look at it in that way that this

389
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,200
maybe fear is not, you know, really such a bad thing. Very nice. Yeah. But sometimes logic

390
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,800
isn't always available to us when we're in the middle of fear. Like think like, okay, there's something good on the

391
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:34,720
other side of this. Sometimes that uh doesn't help us. But I I appreciate what you're saying. Do you do you have a

392
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,880
You're saying joy. Do you is this has this been your experience? I don't know. I was just thinking about

393
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:48,480
why you're talking. I guess my thought is you know that life is only so long.

394
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,680
Like an emotion like this can be horrible. It's pro, it might be

395
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,960
actually something really really good because

396
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:07,119
if if we can like engage our fear or kind of accept it or mle through it or be mindful of it somehow that you know

397
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,640
the it'll probably kind of just kind of turn into something

398
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:19,440
positive. Yep. I would agree. I would agree. And I think in that sense it's just an emotion.

399
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,800
It's not like a It's not like a brick wall. It doesn't

400
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,480
have to be. That's right. It's just a collection of experiences.

401
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,160
That's all it is. But and they're usually uncomfortable. Maybe that's the part though.

402
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:43,280
Yeah. I was just thinking of like what would be a counterpoint. It was just kind of something I was thinking about or like you know o opposites. Yeah.

403
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:50,240
Well, I would say I started talking about how sometimes there's fear when we're in some unfamiliar territory.

404
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,440
Sometimes there's a way in which on the other side is fear is uh more

405
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:01,200
confidence. It's like oh I learned something here and now oh something that I was afraid of I'm not afraid of

406
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:07,200
anymore. And so there can be some and with that can be with confidence maybe

407
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:14,880
some happiness or you know ability to I don't know there's all kinds of things that can come from confidence but joy

408
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:22,280
too. Yeah. Like oh I made it. It wasn't so bad. you know, maybe something like that.

409
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:31,599
Thank you. Okay, so we're at the end of our time.

410
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,800
So, thank you very much and I wish you a

411
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:43,318
lovely rest of the evening and safe travels home. Thank you.
