1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:08,960
so good day everyone and welcome to our sunday morning sitting

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,440
and as we begin this sitting i would like to evoke

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,800
i believe it's an important principle not only of buddhist meditation that we teach here

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,840
and but also of the dharma the teachings of the buddha

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,000
that you know certainly i think have been an

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,520
important part of my practice life and that is the principle

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,640
of simplicity that um

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,239
even though sometimes the dharma the teachings might seem complicated if that's the case

9
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,120
the hope we have is that their purpose is to point to simplicity

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:07,200
perhaps sometimes we're complicated because people are complicated and so to explain

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,799
to point back to a simple way of being a simplicity of being a simplicity of

12
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,000
freedom that sometimes we meet the complexity

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,479
with complexity but to keep in back of the mind you know where is it pointing to

14
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,000
that is simple the simplicity of

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,360
non-clinging the simplicity of just being with the experience with

16
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:45,040
clear vision with clear seeing it's kind of like turning our gaze

17
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,240
upon whatever is happening and having that gaze

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:58,880
be easeful relaxed at peace with what we see the gaze

19
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:06,079
itself our wisdom might see the complexity of the

20
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:14,560
situation or wisdom might tell us what should or shouldn't be done

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:24,000
but not to confuse or entangle the wisdom with the gaze

22
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,440
wisdom with clear seeing and to have this foundation of

23
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,840
simplicity as a simple presence

24
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:46,400
within which wisdom can operate so to take

25
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:56,560
assume a posture that is appropriate for you

26
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:04,080
in allowing your body some ease some simplicity

27
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,840
of being hopefully where there's not much

28
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,239
struggle physically to be present

29
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,720
a posture that allows the body to be still

30
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,879
for this duration

31
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,480
and if there is no such posture then it's fine to do this meditation

32
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,720
as a form of walking meditation back and

33
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,400
forth and then giving some care

34
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:58,840
to settling into this posture maybe moving the body a little bit

35
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:06,159
rotating swaying back and forth maybe even lifting the shoulders up as

36
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,439
high as you're comfortable and then letting them relax

37
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:20,720
and settle and then gently closing the eyes

38
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,800
and feeling the foundation under you the solidity

39
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,840
the hardness the firmness that supports the weight of your body

40
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,479
such a simple everyday phenomenon that we live with we navigate through

41
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:58,639
and which in meditation we rely on to help us settle in

42
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,039
the pull of gravity the weight of our body

43
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,000
is something we yield ourselves in that in the place where the body

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,960
makes contact with that support feeling the ground feeling grounded

45
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,840
there rooted

46
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:39,840
and then further up maybe to soften the belly relax your belly

47
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,919
sometimes when you soften relax the belly let it hang forward and down there's a little bit

48
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,080
more of a foundation a base a groundedness

49
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,360
in the lower torso

50
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:11,039
and then softening in the chest softening around the heart

51
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:27,600
as you exhale relaxing the shoulders softening the shoulders

52
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,479
releasing the shoulders to the pull of

53
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
gravity

54
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,800
and then also as you exhale to soften the muscles of your face

55
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,360
the jaws maybe by having the mouth

56
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,520
just open a teeny bit more than it is maybe the lips are still touching but

57
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,240
the teeth little bit fall away from each other

58
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:34,560
relaxing the cheeks and the muscles around the eyes

59
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,840
letting the eyes eyeballs rest in their sockets

60
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,800
and then softening relaxing around the forehead

61
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,520
the temples and even if it doesn't relax easily

62
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,879
maybe on the exhale can be some softening around that area

63
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:27,840
even if it's just the softening of the way we hold it that we're aware of it

64
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,839
and then behind the forehead between the ears the area of the brain

65
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:48,399
feeling whatever sensations there might be there of energy agitation pressure

66
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,519
contraction hardness

67
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,839
and if there's any of those things then on the exhale softening

68
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:09,839
the brain relaxing that energy

69
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,800
and as you do so

70
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,839
quieting the thinking mind

71
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:45,760
and notice whatever is simple about being here with a modicum of

72
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,360
silence where there's nothing to figure out or attain

73
00:09:51,360 --> 00:10:05,839
or do but to rest with some ease in the simplicity of this moment

74
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
uh

75
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:43,440
and then within the simplicity of the moment to

76
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:52,880
center yourself in the body breathing with whatever way it's easy for you or

77
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:00,800
right for you for awareness to be aligned attuned

78
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:15,839
to the body breathing

79
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,240
and no matter how complicated the mind gets with thoughts and ideas

80
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:30,880
keep returning to the simplicity of breathing breathing here

81
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:42,320
and see how simple you can become so simple perhaps that

82
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,680
desires fall away aversions fall away

83
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,560
expectations fall away

84
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,480
ideas of what is should be and shouldn't be fall away

85
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,040
simplicity where in which everything is allowed to be just the way it is

86
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,600
and we gaze upon it kindly

87
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:30,160
we breathe with it breathe through it without getting entangled

88
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,800
just here sitting breathing

89
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
knowing

90
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:53,839
being simple with how things are

91
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:48,799
if you've wondered often thought chances are that that's a more complicated world

92
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:55,039
concerns than the simplicity of just being here

93
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:01,840
being here alive being here breathing

94
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,840
as if that's enough for just these minutes

95
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,880
and that and then as we come to the end of the sitting

96
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:24,640
maybe using your imagination a little bit and imagine what it would be like

97
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,679
to maintain a simplicity of being

98
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:37,440
a kind of radical simplicity with a kind and clear gaze

99
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,840
of what's happening not needing to understand not needing to

100
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:53,760
fix not needing to explain not needing to defend but to really just be

101
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:00,480
with clearly with what's happening with someone else

102
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:08,240
what is it like to sit quietly with someone on a park bench maybe it's talking simply and chatting

103
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,919
but offering just a simplicity of being

104
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:20,960
contentment and ease with being alive as if for a few moments

105
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:29,840
at least just to be alive is enough alive and breathing

106
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:41,039
and perhaps with that simplicity of being maybe our good will can be simple as

107
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,320
well the simple warmth and goodness

108
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,360
friendliness that doesn't have to be actively

109
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,840
expressed and doesn't have to be explained

110
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,960
but a good will and a generosity of spirit

111
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:12,640
a friendliness and a love a care that maybe is part and parcel of that

112
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,360
simplicity

113
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:27,600
and maybe staying simple to end this sitting

114
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:38,240
with tapping into whatever wish you have for others to live well

115
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,440
may all beings be happy

116
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:53,840
may all beings be safe

117
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,278
may all beings be peaceful

118
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:09,839
may all beings everywhere be free

119
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,800
and may it be that we contribute to that

120
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:35,839
and may it be that our practice contributes to that possibility

121
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,599
so a couple of announcements before i give the talk

122
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,880
the first is that um for those of you who are doing this 7

123
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:53,040
a.m sitting during the week for this week the sittings will start

124
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,240
meditation will start at 6 45 a.m in california time

125
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:05,200
so 15 minutes earlier than usual and partly to give more of you who come

126
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,560
a chance to experience sitting longer after all this time of sitting for half an hour

127
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,800
it's also a little bit easier to have um

128
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,920
maybe take in some of the teachings that we're doing on meditation would sit longer and really

129
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:29,359
settle into them and have more silence during the meditation and we'll do it for seven days including

130
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:35,359
saturday and sunday because i'm teaching a retreat and i'm integrating the

131
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:44,560
morning zoom teachings with the retreat as well and and

132
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,800
the topic of the retreat and also for the 7 a.m sittings are the seven factors

133
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:57,440
of awakening as a support for meditation practice and because i'm on retreat the closing

134
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,880
of the retreat next week is the time for this usual dharma talk on sunday teachings on

135
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:12,480
sunday so i've invited a wonderful dharma teacher that i taught with just a few weeks ago

136
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,640
taught a retreat from who's from south africa lives there and will teach from south africa

137
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:26,560
nolita and she was a really a wonderful wise and

138
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:33,680
kind caring teacher that brings a wonderful flavor

139
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:40,640
of to the dharma of of our own culture and um so i'm very

140
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:48,640
pleased that she'll be here and with our kim for our community and uh and uh just like uh

141
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,000
twarey who taught last week tori sala who had the idea that she wanted some

142
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,359
people on zoom to have a living audience to relate to

143
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,440
nalith i believe will do the same thing so probably on the chat or on the imc calendar at some point

144
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,760
there'll be a zoom link as well and so some of you might want to be there rather than on the

145
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,440
on the youtube um and a little bit supports to speak some

146
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:24,240
speakers because they get to see have some sense that there's people participating

147
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:33,440
so um

148
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,599
so for this sunday morning talk a little bit in the background or the

149
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:45,920
foundation of the talk is the idea that the dharma dharma practice points to simplicity

150
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:55,119
it's a very simple thing and it can be deceptively simple it can be

151
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,560
surprisingly simple what we're looking for we're looking for the freedom from

152
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,480
suffering the alleviation of suffering and and that's at the heart of what the

153
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:15,920
dharma the whole religiosity of the buddha is about and um and part of the reason why it's

154
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:23,520
useful to emphasize the simplicity is that people who uh many people will come to buddhism

155
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,839
with all kinds of expectations about what a religion is what they want

156
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:35,520
um that that is searching for something that's in a

157
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:42,160
sense outside of themselves and there's nothing inherently wrong with that and

158
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:48,400
it can be quite wonderful in itself to find a religious life or source that's outside of oneself

159
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,440
but the dharma of the buddha is in a sense found within ourselves and it's

160
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:00,880
kind of very simple way and and one way that uh

161
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:09,200
when characteristics of this or emphasis or this simplicity is the the practice of letting go

162
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,640
rather than acquiring more ideas more concepts building up

163
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,839
ourselves and our conceit there's a real emphasis on letting go

164
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:26,960
letting go letting go but letting go is uh people make it more complicated than it needs to be

165
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,079
and sometimes react to it negatively because on this means i have to let go of all my possessions or

166
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,200
let go of the people i love in my life the in the teachings of the buddha the

167
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,800
letting go is almost entirely or maybe entirely

168
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,400
having to do with letting go of particular mental states or mental activity

169
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,160
that's within ourselves not letting go of things of the world

170
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,240
so the primary letting go is letting go of our clinging letting go of the grasping or the

171
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,960
craving that we have the contractions that come along with some of the desires and aversions we have

172
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,960
and so um that's what we're letting go of and if

173
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,440
we turn around and really look at ourselves deeply we'll see we'll feel that the clingings

174
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:26,880
the cravings we have um are of way of self-harm the way that we're kind of hurting ourselves uh causing

175
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,079
pain and suffering to ourselves and in the buddhist analysis that's the suffering

176
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:39,040
that we have the most ability to do something about the suffering that we contribute contribute to through our clinging and

177
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:46,240
our grasping so that's what we're letting go now when we let go

178
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:55,119
um there are things that we abandon we impact clinging craving grasping

179
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:01,440
we abandon hatred aversion hostility and we abandon a certain confusion a

180
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,800
tendency towards confusion or delusion so there are things we let go of but

181
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:12,720
these again all internal things and there's not a search for something outside of ourselves

182
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:20,160
a search for god a search for some kind of cosmic kind of understanding or wisdom or

183
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,520
consciousness it's not a connection to something beyond ourselves

184
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:32,720
which is a wonderful thing that can happen our sense of interconnectedness to life and all that but that's not the heart

185
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:39,680
of the buddhist spirituality which is um maybe seems very simplistic reductionistic maybe not enough

186
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:47,280
in the fullness of life and um and that may be but still over and over

187
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:54,960
again the buddha pointed to this simplicity of letting go of greed hatred and delusion and

188
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:02,240
for the buddha that's the ultimate that's like that to do that thoroughly fully is this full message that he's giving

189
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,680
um for people who have other ideas of what they want their life to really be about

190
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:14,480
um then i think buddhism contributes in that it says or offers that whatever your

191
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,240
values are whatever way you want to live and be connected understand this life that we live in

192
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:25,839
even if you're like you believe in god or cosmic consciousness or you have your fundamental religious

193
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:32,560
belief is the interconnectedness of life all those ideas

194
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:38,720
what buddhism has to offer is please don't

195
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,720
don't use those ideas as a justification for greed hate and delusion

196
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:51,920
don't don't focus on those so much that you lose touch with this deep inner potential

197
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:58,640
to not have greed hatred delusion let that be the foundation and then you can do all kinds of other

198
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:05,040
things in a much richer more meaningful way but for the buddha it was really just

199
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:11,680
this this inner life that we're rectifying or freeing and then the rest of life comes

200
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:18,079
another way so there's something we abandon but the letting go is not just about what's

201
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:23,839
abandoned it's also about what is gained and this probably is not emphasized enough

202
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:29,760
in teachings of letting go letting go is kind of uh on the surface can seem like yes we

203
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,880
let go of something and then at the best where hands are open we're open-hearted or open-minded we're

204
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:41,680
kind of left without clinging to something but it's it's uh better than that letting go of

205
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,880
clinging grasping craving letting go of hatred and

206
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:54,160
and hostility aversion letting go of regrets and agitation sloth torpor

207
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:02,240
doubt letting go of all these things we gain something as a result

208
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:08,640
and it's kind of like um there's been a there's a dam that filled

209
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:15,680
with water and then the gate is one of the the gate uh is opened and the water begins to flow

210
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:21,040
out uh and flows out and fills the river below

211
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:26,079
and and that just flows and flows and flows and it's a wonderful thing to have the

212
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:33,680
water flowing and not bottled up by the dam so the same thing uh when we let go something begins to

213
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:39,760
flow something begins to move through us that maybe has been held back by the greed hate and delusion by the

214
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,520
clinging and grasping and there's the gain of what happens in that flow

215
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:51,200
when the when something has been released and let go that was covering over or resisting or

216
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:58,960
blocking something inside and so the

217
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:06,079
there's a number of things that open up when we let go

218
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:13,119
and have cultivated awareness and presence and and one of those things is the seven

219
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:20,000
factors of awakening that um when we have a deep letting go

220
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,079
it frees up a certain kind of energy frees up a certain kind of momentum in our life

221
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:33,839
that makes available to us much more mindfulness um a clear

222
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:39,599
this cleared distinguishing of phenomena clear seeing

223
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:45,440
which we call investigation sometimes in english effort

224
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:52,240
joy tranquility samadhi and equanimity

225
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:59,839
and these are not strange foreign ideas to human beings uh it takes maybe

226
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:06,000
it doesn't take that much an uh reflection maybe to see that they're they're accompanying us to some degree

227
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,680
maybe in small degrees here and there in our life in ways that we don't really appreciate

228
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:18,319
and so one of the ways the examples the buddha gave for this that and how these seven factors

229
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:24,400
awakening can arise is when um is listening to uh

230
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:31,839
the buddha at least giving a dharma talk a great teacher gives a talk and um it's uh it's very engaging and

231
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:36,960
compelling to really be present and listen closely and like what's being said is so important

232
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,800
so clear so profound that we're really there to find out what is this that's being said

233
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:48,480
and there's a fullness of attention that is

234
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:57,680
it's we're satisfying mindful but we're really the tension is really present to take in this experience and

235
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:07,838
maybe even with all our faculties not just cognitively with the mind but with our our hearts our body or all our senses

236
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:15,040
as as the thing the ordinary thinking discursive

237
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,839
conversational mind quiets down and we're just taking something in with

238
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:26,960
clarity there might still be some thinking involved but the thinking is very very simple and

239
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,319
clear that there there's more more clarity in the eyesight and the perception of

240
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:39,599
things and we see things much more clearly i remember i gave i went i went to uh i

241
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:45,359
had i've been to very engaging talk sometimes academic talks when i when i started taking botany

242
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:53,520
classes and i was really absorbed in the details of the botany class and would leave class and and and i'd come

243
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:59,680
we'll go out into the courtyard in this university where i went and i'd see everything so clearly

244
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:07,200
everything sparkled and was clear and bright and in a way that they hadn't been when i went in there's something about

245
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:14,160
cleaning the the filters of our eyes developing a clear seeing

246
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,200
that comes with really being present and not distracted by our thoughts

247
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,400
and then listening to a good talk there's there's some kind of aliveness and energy and alertness

248
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,000
it might even sit up a little bit straighter oh this is interesting what's going on here

249
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,200
and then there's also maybe some joy maybe you wouldn't call it joy at the time but

250
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,240
all the troubles fall away all the preoccupations of life all the way we're really right here

251
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,440
and it just feels so good and delightful to be with the experience

252
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:51,440
and also uh there may be listening to a dharma talk very reassuring a deep sense of

253
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,960
reassuring oh this makes sense this puts things into place this is the way forward

254
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:03,599
and something inside of us settles and gets peaceful and quiet and then there's a gathering together of

255
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:10,079
all the faculties we're really here in a concentrated way which means we're really present with all we have

256
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:17,359
focused on what's being said and what the meaning is and perhaps also

257
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:24,720
similar to tranquility it's so reassuring and so so clear what's being said that now i

258
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:33,200
understand there's an equanimity and a balance and now i understand that there's no value in grasping on

259
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,240
or pushing away or leaning forward or pulling back

260
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:44,559
there's value in just staying balanced and taking in the experience being present for the experience

261
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:50,559
without the usual reactivity with it and there's the equanimity

262
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:56,079
so with letting go uh the the and that kind of the gate of the

263
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:02,400
dam is opened it's the the water is the seven factors of awakening

264
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:09,839
and what's remarkable is that these are um can be seen almost as

265
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:17,839
qualities or aspects of awareness itself as we become more aware in an

266
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:23,440
unobstructed way it gets filled with these seven factors of awakening

267
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:30,160
the opposite of this according to the buddha is the five hindrances sensual desire

268
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:38,480
aversion lethargy and resistance agitation and regrets and doubt

269
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:45,680
and these have the opposite effect hindrances they hinder they obstruct

270
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,720
they cover over things and so um

271
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:59,040
it's like closing the gates of the dam and then the water builds up pressure behind the dam i block something and as we get

272
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:04,800
partly because with the hindrances the focus of the mind is to be preoccupied with something

273
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:12,240
and to be preoccupied in a contracted and narrow and tight way and so there's no room for the seven

274
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:21,599
factors of awakening to flow out into the awareness or be found in a clear form of awareness

275
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:26,720
so the buddha talked about letting go of the five hindrances

276
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:34,800
it isn't just letting go of them that's important but it's also how they create space or open the gate for

277
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:42,720
the seven factors of awakening to begin opening or peering or flowing into our presence into our

278
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,920
awareness and so we're gaining something as well

279
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,440
and uh and uh so the letting go of great hate and

280
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,720
delusion is not just about what we abandon

281
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:05,599
it's also what we gain in other teachings the buddha points to

282
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:11,440
the five the four divine abodes the four brahmaviharas

283
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:17,280
is what starts flowing when the uh gate has been pulled away from the

284
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,319
opened in the dam then there's so so there's mehta uh

285
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:27,599
karuna mudita and the pali words usually translated into english as

286
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,720
loving kindness compassion appreciative joy sympathetic joy and

287
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:38,400
equanimity and these are beautiful qualities of art

288
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:44,880
and uh they also are limited by our preoccupations there's no room

289
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,960
for love and care and compassion if we're caught up in things like desire caught

290
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,960
up in aversion doubt regrets and so to abandon those to

291
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:03,359
release those it isn't just a matter isn't that we have to then evoke this loving kindness

292
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:09,119
or compassion there's something about the heart that has space now to breathe breathing room

293
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:15,200
for the heart that tends to then give birth to

294
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:20,880
these beautiful qualities of heart there's space for them and if there's

295
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,920
space for them they flow and so part of practice is to abandon to

296
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:31,359
let go so that some of the best parts of our human life

297
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:38,240
can flow and have a chance to be present and so um

298
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:44,400
and so the simplicity of all this is that this is this core aspects of the buddha's

299
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:52,079
teachings is not exactly a religious teaching it's not exactly a um you know my

300
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:58,160
religion versus your religion it's actually teaching something which um just as uh

301
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:06,000
i'd like to think of it just practical psychology or practical uh spiritual practice that's available

302
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,319
to anybody regardless of what religion they are and there's a remarkable teachings from

303
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:19,200
the ancient discourse that points to this that i'd like to read

304
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:27,200
from the connected discourses of the buddha the book of threes and i think it's um

305
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,839
this course

306
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,040
71 i think

307
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:54,720
72 and so here a man comes to

308
00:55:54,720 --> 00:56:03,119
ananda the buddhist buddhist one of the chief disciples and asks in this question who's dhamma

309
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:08,160
dhamma is well expounded and dhamma is can be a word that's

310
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:15,119
synonymous with religion and in the ancient world it means teachings or religious doctrine or

311
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:22,799
something like that so whose religious doctrine is well expounded the question one question on who in the

312
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:30,640
world are practicing the right way the good way who are those people who are prac really practicing the good way

313
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:37,760
and the true way and then question number three is who in the world are the fortunate

314
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,599
ones and um and so the buddha then go uh

315
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:52,559
goes on and says that those who teach the abandoning of

316
00:56:52,559 --> 00:57:02,000
greed hatred and delusion um are the ones um

317
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:11,599
he says this what do you think is that dumb of those who teach the

318
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:18,079
abandoning of great hatred delusion well expanded or not or how do you take

319
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:23,359
it and the person who is talking to ananda says well the dhamma of those who teach

320
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:29,440
the abandoning of greed hate and illusion is well expounded and there are the religious teachings of those who teach

321
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:35,599
the abandoning of great hate and delusion that's well taught that's a good teaching

322
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:41,200
and and what do you think ananda continues are those practicing for the

323
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:49,280
abandoning of lust hatred great hatred and illusion practicing the the good way in the world or not how do

324
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:57,599
you take it those practicing for the abandoning of great hate and delusion are practicing the good way

325
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:04,799
and then are those who are practicing who are abandoning greed hate and delusion and really cut them out

326
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:10,799
really obliterated them to the end are they the fortunate ones and the man

327
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:16,319
says yes those are the fortunate ones so then there was that what he says next

328
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:22,079
is uh very nice the that's the householder the man who's asking questions for

329
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:31,359
of ananda says it is astounding it's amazing ananda

330
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:38,400
that there there is no that you have not extolled your own dhamma

331
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:44,799
nor any denigration of the dumb of others but just teaching the dhamma in its own

332
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:51,680
sphere so buddha ananda is not championing

333
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:57,040
the buddha's dharma or or dismissing the importance of other

334
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:02,880
people's dharma which is often what you get if someone says what's what's the best religious

335
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,319
teaching in the world some people might say oh mine is of course but rather than saying something

336
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:15,280
like that ananda is just offering this principle's idea about abandoning green hate and delusion

337
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:23,280
and then and then rather than making any claim about how wonderful it is he asks the um the person asking the

338
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:30,880
question is this well expounded is this the good way is this are these the fortunate people

339
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:38,960
those who practice it and the man admits that's that's the answer that i was looking for and so

340
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:44,839
um so this simplicity

341
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:51,520
of of this inner look and not looking

342
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:59,040
outside not looking for what's ultimate in kind of kind of religious way maybe not looking for metaphysical

343
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:04,319
claims of truth not looking for deep understandings of the nature of the

344
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:09,760
universe the world the cosmos the beginning of time the end

345
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:15,440
of time there's many answers that the buddhism doesn't answer

346
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:21,599
but rather to the heart of it is the simplicity of

347
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:26,960
looking within oneself and freeing oneself

348
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:34,880
of forces which limit us that block the flow letting those go

349
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:40,880
and then letting something beautiful flow that's there kind of like it's there waiting for us

350
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:46,079
though it's not really there it's not like a thing that exists independent of us

351
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:52,160
it's thing that exists with opening up with the freedom with abandoning with

352
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:57,838
awareness set free and

353
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:05,119
and so letting go both involves what is abandoned but also what

354
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:12,160
is gained and um and so we gain

355
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:19,119
and then and more often than not what the buddha talks about is

356
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:25,839
we abandon greed hatred and delusion and then we gain freedom in some places

357
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:31,440
he adds a fourth thing that's abandoned so there's four things

358
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:37,839
and this maybe is helpful the fourth one to keep in mind so that we abandon the great heightened

359
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:46,000
delusion and be sure to keep it really simple the fourth thing to be abandoned is conceit

360
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,319
create hatred and delusion and conceit and and then if we really let go of

361
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:58,799
conceit as well then having abandoned great hate and delusion won't give rise to conceit

362
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:04,640
look how special i am i'm i have the most wonderful teachings i have the most

363
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:11,280
wonderful practice i have the most wonderful attainment i'm the most fortunate one

364
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:19,200
if making making an eye out of it and building up the self is also abandoned and this is also a

365
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:25,200
delightful thing that uh opens the gates for what's

366
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:30,480
uh wonderful in us to flow out conceit is one of those things that closes the gate

367
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:37,920
blocks the flow in a sense so keeping it simple

368
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:45,280
appreciating the value of what we can let go of within that which blocks us and limits us and

369
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:51,359
appreciating what's gained as we let go and really feeling into that and

370
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:56,960
experiencing those gains and maybe in doing so becoming

371
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:04,640
recognizing the seven factors of awakening within us maybe recognizing them

372
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:10,480
in a very small initial way but slowly developing having them recognizing them more and

373
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:16,000
more and giving space for them and letting them really be a support for

374
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:22,720
this life of freedom a life that is free of clinging

375
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:30,720
so thank you very much and uh and may this week be one in which

376
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:37,280
you discover the value greater value in letting go in recognizing the seven factors

377
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:45,839
awakening in your life
