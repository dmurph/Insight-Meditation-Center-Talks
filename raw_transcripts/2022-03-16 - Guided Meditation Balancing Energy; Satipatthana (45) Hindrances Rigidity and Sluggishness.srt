1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,759
so good day everyone happy to be here

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,880
and um this being the could be could mark the

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,080
so uh end of our second year

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,880
of doing these youtube uh sittings and teachings together

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,359
thank you for these two years i appreciate it very much and um

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,559
i'll say a little bit more about that later for now i would like to uh for this

7
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:43,360
meditation um imagine that you're a passenger in a car

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,840
and the driver you notice after a while that when the driver gets excited about

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,960
the conversation you're having the driver pushes more on the gas pedal

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,719
and you go fast maybe someone's faster more maybe faster you and then you're comfortable

11
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,000
but when the conversation's not going in a good way and the driver feels challenged and

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,040
or feels discouraged about something or feels overwhelmed or feels like you know this is just

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,799
you know maybe maybe getting bad news or something

14
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,040
that uh the the driver pulls the pedal off the gas a

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,159
little bit a foot off the gas pedal a bit and the car slows down and maybe slower than you're comfortable on the freeway

16
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,759
and you see that in your trip constantly depending on the mood the attitude the beliefs that

17
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,880
how how the driver is reacting to the conversation

18
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,680
the pedal goes up and down and this car goes slower or faster

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,240
so we're this way as well that uh there are

20
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,759
forces within us they get us to put up put the gas pedal on our energy

21
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,399
and that we suddenly were energized and excited and and there's lots of energy and other

22
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,599
times when things happen to us that we we

23
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:21,040
remove the energy we don't apply or give energy to our life and we go slower we the energy sinks there's

24
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,720
a sinking feeling the classic this language of this is sinking mind

25
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,680
and an excited mind and so in meditation it's possible to be

26
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,000
aware of this movement from from the mind being somehow uh

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,319
not being not having a vital alive uh energy that keeps it kind of going in

28
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,440
a nice way the mind feels drained or subdued or

29
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,760
numb or you know sluggish or

30
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,319
you know closed down or the mind gets hyper aroused

31
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,159
and gets maybe from fear and anxiety regrets maybe some kind of

32
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:16,879
restlessness that goes on agitation and and so we can watch this in meditation

33
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,080
we could be the passenger in our own car and mindfulness allows us it gives a

34
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,000
chance to see this what's happening and to become sensitive to that movement of energy

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,400
that um from a kind of balanced energy to over energized and under energized

36
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,000
and sometimes it can be dramatic some some thought or feeling arises something that

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,040
goes on memory arises and it can go one way or the other quite strongly

38
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,360
i've had anger arise in meditation and boy suddenly i was like on fire with energy just thinking about something

39
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,439
that happened long ago and and so

40
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,920
and so it can be quite subtle as well little movements it could be that the mind wanders off a

41
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,239
little bit too much for your liking and so there's a little bit discouragement i can't do this this is

42
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,759
too hard and with that attitude you can feel the sinking of energy

43
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,919
and a little bit more less energy available to engage and so as we practice

44
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:31,199
we want to it's nice to become sensitive to the swings of the energy that go on

45
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,440
and maybe there's always a little bit of swings and and a little bit we can adjust for

46
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,639
it and simply being mindful of it is already an adjustment

47
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,520
so in this meditation perhaps you can do this

48
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,360
so taking an alert posture sitting upright

49
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,440
or literally and maybe lower your gaze to about 45

50
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,720
degrees to the floor and let your eyes becomes

51
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,400
relaxed let your eyes become soft without

52
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:21,919
looking anything in particular and then

53
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,479
if it's comfortable gently close your eyes

54
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:41,840
and become aware of your energy level become aware of how you're feeling

55
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:53,479
how much vitality there is does it feel like overenergized

56
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,319
under-energized just right

57
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:09,440
and whatever way it is for these moments it's okay let yourself be the way you are

58
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,280
just recognize it

59
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,800
and then gently take a few long slow deep breaths

60
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:30,800
maybe deep breaths and almost like expanding of the body expands into your

61
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,440
energy level

62
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:44,080
you feel into the energized body and as you exhale you relax

63
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,240
the body

64
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,840
letting your breathing return to normal and continue

65
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,039
relaxing the body there is a way of relaxing the body

66
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:23,680
that simultaneously gives a kind of a

67
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,120
good energy to the mind an energy which i

68
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,160
associated with clarity a relaxation that brings clarity

69
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,440
relaxing the face

70
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,960
relaxing the shoulders

71
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,879
softening the belly

72
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:18,080
and then letting your breathing return to normal and notice now

73
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:25,720
how is your energy level your vitality or

74
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,080
the ability to engage here and now

75
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,560
and is there some quality or some way you are

76
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,760
about sitting here to meditate

77
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,959
that limits your the energy that's available an attitude this is work and you don't

78
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,240
like to work attitude that is difficult

79
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,320
the idea that life has been hard and so you're

80
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,040
overwhelmed coming here so there's kind of giving up or letting go or

81
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,240
unwillingness it could be very subtle

82
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:36,760
or is it more the other side excited restless

83
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,600
over eager

84
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:55,839
racing ahead that energy of wanting or

85
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:02,120
energy of aversion that keeps us charged up

86
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:16,000
and if you're under energized

87
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,720
can you bring in some more energy to the practice

88
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:32,680
that helps bring clarity to the present moment clarity of seeing

89
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:41,160
and if you're over energized can you soften relax

90
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,839
and when it feels just right or close enough to write

91
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,959
allow yourself to then just be with meditation

92
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,200
be with the coming and going of the breath

93
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,880
what's happening now with your energy

94
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:08,240
and coming near the end of this meditation what is your energy like now

95
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,159
the energy of your engaging in mindfulness

96
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:31,919
what if any forces within you that tend to be deflating of your energy

97
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:39,039
and what forces within you brings too much energy

98
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:54,000
and to simply see it know it without needing to judge it or react to

99
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,720
it just for a moment here just see it clearly

100
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:11,840
and then this ability to see clearly what is is not a small thing

101
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:18,720
it's one of the great gifts that we can give the world so we see without the filter of our

102
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,919
attitudes beliefs without our reactions to what's

103
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:30,720
happening so we learned to have this clarity of

104
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:37,840
seeing of ourselves and then we learn to do it with others

105
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:46,000
to the world and may it be that our ability to

106
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,960
see clearly allows us also to seek kindly

107
00:28:53,520 --> 00:29:02,240
to see generously to see with care and compassion

108
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,039
being attuned to what brings welfare and happiness

109
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,080
it may it be that this practice that we do

110
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:21,919
it's always encouraging us to apply it to this world

111
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,840
so some way or other we're making a better world for all beings

112
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:37,120
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

113
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,440
may all beings be peaceful

114
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,398
and may all beings be free

115
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:57,279
and in particular may we spread this kindness and care and wish

116
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,840
to all the people suffering in the ukraine

117
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,840
certainly the ukrainians but i imagine it's for me it's

118
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,559
heartbreaking

119
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,559
what this situation must be like for many of the russians and soldiers

120
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,279
may they be safe and go home may they be happy

121
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:36,480
may they be free and find some way to not participate

122
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,240
in this violence that they've been sent to

123
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,158
they all beings live together

124
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,720
in friendship

125
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:06,559

make a difference in the world

152
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,200
and so so

153
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:03,680
where the topic is now the third of the five hindrances

154
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:11,280
and in english it's often called sloth and torpor and i suspect that a good percentage of you

155
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,040
don't use those words it's not in your kind of active vocabulary especially the word sloth

156
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:24,960
maybe it is maybe especially if you've been around this insight scene for a while and maybe you've picked it up

157
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,119
and it's not it's not so clear this is the best words for what the pali is

158
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,480
the the original buddhist idea where sloth and torpor came as

159
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:43,520
translations i don't as translations of these terms i don't know but it's been around for a long time so

160
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,720
it might have been the 18th century english translators who

161
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,880
chose a word that maybe had particular meaning for them

162
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,160
the word for um

163
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,920
sloth the pali word literally means rigid

164
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,960
or stiff and in a mind that becomes stiff or rigid or

165
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,760
not soft and pliable and the word for torpor

166
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,040
that maybe works but i like the word sluggish it's the tradition says that the second

167
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:32,079
one has more to do with physical the body and the first one more with the mind so the mind becomes rigid the mind

168
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,119
becomes um stiff or the or there's a sluggishness in the

169
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:43,520
body but you know where exactly where this stiffness and sluggishness is whether

170
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:50,960
it's mind or body or both um it doesn't really matter in practice we're just paying attention to how it is

171
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:58,320
and this is a movement of the mind when the energy level energy is not

172
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,320
alive and engaged in a nice healthy flowing way and so it's often considered associated

173
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,599
with a sinking mind a sinking of energy sinking of vitality

174
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:18,000
in the mind the next hindrance to forth uh is the act the arousal over arouse arousing of

175
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,040
the mind so what we're noticing here is the energy level the activity the engagement

176
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,119
level of the mind and that can be either it can sink or it can be over aroused

177
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,240
and there's many reasons for that in life in following

178
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:41,200
desire and aversion the first two hindrances uh if we're able success successfully to

179
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,680
kind of not be caught in the grip of greeds and and hatred and ill will

180
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,440
then some people's minds don't have the usual entertainment don't have the usual

181
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,040
fire that kept it going sometimes people are exhausted

182
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,839
from too much wanting too much anxiety too much um

183
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:11,119
aversion they're angry all the time and when we finally stop the greed or

184
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,720
the fear or the anxiety or the or the anger

185
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,960
sometimes we crash sometimes the energy level drops down and and some of it has to do with just kind of finally getting

186
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,960
to rest but some of it has to do with the confusion a little bit

187
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:36,000
maybe depression a little bit and not knowing where where to put the mind what to do and a little bit lost

188
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,680
and there's no good cause to be engaged in and want to have or want to make go away

189
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,440
and the person's never discovered maybe the natural vitality of awareness of

190
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,280
attention because the vitality of attention was always being fueled by greed and

191
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,400
aversion or sometimes by fear and so there's a huge adjustment

192
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,880
that can happen when those those caffeines of the soul i call them are not operating and we go through

193
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:16,960
withdrawals a little bit sometimes a sinking mind the mind gets rigid or or closed tight

194
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:23,680
or gets we get sluggish in some way or other is a response or a reaction

195
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,280
to our circumstances we might feel overwhelmed we might have too much stimuli

196
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,480
too much emotional difficulties and it's just so hard for our heart our mind to

197
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,680
manage and i know we believe we can't manage we have ideas that should be different and

198
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:46,720
we feel discouraged and we feel maybe that a lot of self-pity or a lot of self

199
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:53,520
doubt because i should have done better i made a mistake or something and um and so all these different

200
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:00,400
attitudes come into play around the difficulty of our lives and sometimes our lives are extremely

201
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:07,599
difficult they don't want to dismiss diminish or pretend it's not difficult

202
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:14,240
but one of the ways the mind responds to that is to get rigid is to get to numb

203
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,520
is to get closed down another way that we

204
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:25,200
we can get sluggish as a sometimes sluggish is resistance to what we don't

205
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:32,160
to do what we don't want to do sometimes it's just a sense of being deeply deeply worried and tired

206
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:39,599
and so like we kind of give up a little bit and um and so uh

207
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,520
this is part this this is part of the you know one of the ways in which the mind responds to difficulties and

208
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:51,200
challenges and it can be dramatic and very big it can

209
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:58,240
be very subtle as meditation gets clearer and more and more clear as meditation practice gets

210
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,000
stronger we can get sensitive to the more subtle shifts in this direction of

211
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,400
of um uh stiffness or rigidity of mind and

212
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,680
sluggishness and um and it can be very subtle it can be like

213
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:22,240
you know just just a little feeling that it's just too much to stay with a full

214
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:28,240
in-breath you know just like you know i've i did that before and and so there's the mind kind of doesn't

215
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,960
want to do it anymore there's a kind of a little bit resistance and so something shuts down

216
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,960
or it starts feeling that meditations become a duty we've done it for a long time it's just in the sense of duty and

217
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,680
one more time i have to do it and something inside gets rigid or tight or closed

218
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:54,079
or we've had meditations and they've been you know three days of difficult meditations and something inside feels so

219
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:02,640
discouraged that the energy level drops or tops away and there's a sluggishness and unwillingness of the mind to operate

220
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:09,680
and so uh this is all we could the hindrances can all be considered normal human

221
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,040
uh mental activities we're born with hindrances they come with human life

222
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:21,200
and it's not a personal failing to have them but it is a personal field of

223
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:27,280
mindfulness it's a personal place to discover and what's happening with us get become wise

224
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,800
about what's happening with us and so one of the tasks of mindfulness

225
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,319
is to start becoming sensitive to the movements of energy and for this

226
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:43,359
third hindrance how energy sinks the sinking mind or

227
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:50,800
energy gets frozen or tight or the mind gets rigid the heart gets rigid

228
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:58,160
and and then become wise with it practice with it wisely and one of the ways to be wise about it

229
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,280
is to make this 180 degree turn to really feel and sense this

230
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:09,040
more really kind of care for oneself by feeling well what this is rather than being

231
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:15,520
discouraged by our discouragement rather than being overwhelmed by our overwhelm or how we're shutting down and how we're

232
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:22,480
not practicing just right or something care for ourselves by turning attention just oh this is how it is now and feel

233
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,160
it and be with it and it's invaluable to feel and be with an experience

234
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,920
and partly because that's one of what one of the things we're trying to develop in this

235
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,520
practice is the ability to have clarity of seeing clear knowing clear feeling of

236
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:45,440
what actually is so we're developing it with the things that are difficult

237
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:52,319
we might also discover that some of the attitudes underlying this third hindrance

238
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:59,200
attitudes of shoulds or it's too much or it's been too long or it's been

239
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,560
uh you know i can't manage um i'm supposed to be better so there's

240
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:10,880
all these attitudes that kind of can uh can drain be draining for us to live by

241
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,720
and so we see those attitudes and to see them as attitudes this can be quite powerful

242
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,800
when the time comes when the meditation is a very clear and peaceful and settled

243
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:29,359
then it might be very subtle the movements of the third hindrance

244
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,720
but we can see it arise see it be born and because we're familiar with it from

245
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:40,640
all that kind of practicing with it for a long time then we see it just come arise the first

246
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:48,000
inklings of it the hints of it and then it might be possible to let go of it to abandon it

247
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,480
and this is really a good thing to do when the abandoning of it feels like uh it moves us to greater

248
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:01,680
health great moves us to a greater clarity and a good way of being and so

249
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,119
in this practice of the hindrances we want to be able to see clearly

250
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:13,760
and then if it's easy enough to let go and then appreciate the absence

251
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,200
and the helpfulness of the absence of this rigid mind or the sluggishness that

252
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,480
might arise so

253
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,480
the hindrances and so tomorrow we'll do

254
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,440
um we'll do

255
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:41,280
restlessness they will over energize the hindrance

256
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:48,079
and so forth we'll do doubt on friday and then doubt today afterwards we'll do a community meeting on zoom and

257
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:53,599
i look forward to meeting those of you who come to that

258
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,359
so thank you all very much
