00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,760
hello and welcome to this Monday

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:13,080
morning welcome to participating in

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:20,800
this Wern California 7 a.m. meditation and this wide community of people all of

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,400
you coming together so I appreciate that you're

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:34,760
here and attending so one of the principles of meditation

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,160
that's fairly well known is that we are practicing

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:47,480
mindfulness awareness and concentration for the purposes of going

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,640
from a more activated state to a calmer State meditation is often associated

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,920
with becoming calm going from a stressful state to

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:07,240
distressing and becoming peaceful but the story doesn't end

11
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,960
there the purpose of becoming calm the per purpose of becoming

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,720
peaceful is not meant to be for its own purpose it's a nice thing to do for

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,040
sure but it has a greater possibility purpose and that is that when we are

14
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,320
calms and centered on ourselves centered in our body centered in

15
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,360
our in ourselves when we're

16
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:41,840
peaceful and awake with all the senses in the

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,159
body kind of a tighten sensitivity then that is a a access

18
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:55,920
point that's an entry point or possibility

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,280
for a deeper form of intelligence creativity maybe some people would call

20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,879
it intuition maybe some people would call it a more more holistic way of thinking

21
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:17,480
or considering or being attuned to ourselves in this

22
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:24,879
world there's a possibility of a profound form of contemplation

23
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,840
consideration thinking that is the alternative

24
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:38,120
to thinking about the world not ourselves in a reactive

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,840
way reactive thinking is constricted and

26
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,800
narrow when we are not constricted not agitated not

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:58,200
activated then deeper sources of consideration of reflection is possible

28
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,920
within deeper sources of understanding some of the understanding might even

29
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,400
seem nonverbal deeper than

30
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,080
verbal so for this sitting with that idea in mind for this sitting if you

31
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:28,080
find yourself in conflict with anything while you're meditating agitated upset disturbed by

32
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:36,080
anything this meditation when you're in that state is not the time to think about it to solve it to

33
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,720
analyze it to review it instead as we're meditating if become

34
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:50,560
aware of how this is a activated state if you're critical of anything if you're

35
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,959
upset with yourself in any way simply consider it an activated

36
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:04,280
State agitated state more energized State maybe a constricted state where

37
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:12,640
the attention gets now narrowed onto the concern and see if you can relax deeply

38
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:21,079
relax it all not as a betrayal to it all but rather to relax deeply so when

39
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:27,199
the time is right maybe the end of the meditation then you can pick up the

40
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,520
concern and reflect on it contemp ated with greater wisdom with greater

41
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:41,160
capacity for kind of profound attention profound

42
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,639
intelligence and if you're not activated by anything even activated sometimes by

43
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:56,400
Fant good fantasies then we can just focus on breathing being simple here in the

44
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,560
moment so assuming a meditation posture

45
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:10,400
mindfulness begins in the physical activity

46
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:18,240
of placing ourselves in our meditation posture and taking some care and

47
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,000
attention to the little details of how we position our

48
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
body

49
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,800
and lowering the

50
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,919
Gaze maybe closing your

51
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:59,840
eyes and taking a few moments to feel notice become aware of

52
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:08,080
how it is for you to be breathing right now without any concern of changing

53
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:16,560
it a curiosity a discovery of how you are through how you're

54
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
breathing

55
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:42,520
and if there seems to be some tension in breathing

56
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:49,440
or overactivation with breathing very gently as you

57
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,160
exhale relax especially the end of the

58
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:03,680
exhale relax so the exhale continues for few brief

59
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,520
moments and as you breathe now with the

60
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:40,240
exhale with a gentleness throughout your

61
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,400
body on the exhale relax in your body in

62
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,280
the face the shoulders the

63
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
belly

64
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,120
and if as you're relaxing your body it feels good to adjust your

65
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:21,120
posture more you may do

66
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
so

67
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:45,360
and then as you exhale also to relax or

68
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,160
soften the thinking

69
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,200
mind the tension or activation it may be associated with

70
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
thinking

71
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
for

72
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
for

73
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:33,800
and and then settling into the body

74
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:44,959
breathing as if you're accompanying the body's experience of

75
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,360
breathing you're riding along with the movements of the body as you breathe in

76
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,880
and breathe

77
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
out

78
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:35,399
for and if you find yourself upset or activated by

79
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:43,839
anything about yourself your meditation about others about the

80
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:53,279
world Focus less or not at all on the content of the

81
00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:00,399
concern but rather on feeling how it's an activated state

82
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,480
maybe a constricted or pressure

83
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,839
State and so then as you're

84
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:20,720
exhaling relax the activation relax the

85
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:28,240
tension until you can settle back resting in the experience of

86
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,880

thinking any tension or pressure anywhere in your

system relax and as you

119
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,320
relax feel your way settle your

120
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,600
way into a way into a deeper piece deeper

121
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:49,200
calm maybe recognizing where deep inside you're the most peaceful

122
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,799
calist let everything settle

and then as we come to the end of this

129
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:50,840
sitting do once again as you exhale settle more

130
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:57,720
deeply maybe extending the exhale so there could be little little

131
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,919
bit more relaxation or relaxing so a little bit

132
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:07,919
more longer

133
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:20,919
exhale and in the longer letting go settling into

134
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:28,960
the quietest maybe the most comfortable

135
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,880
place deep within your

136
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:49,159
body and resting there the calest place

137
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:56,519
within considering the welfare and happiness of everyone that you

138
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:02,080
know having an attitude of wishing

139
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:09,039
everyone well even the people you have the most

140
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:15,880
difficulty with wishing them well happiness and

141
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,559
peace partly because you know then to for them to really have

142
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:29,440
happiness and peace they'll probably behave better

143
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,799
may all beings be

144
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,720

149
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,440
thank

150
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
you

151
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:26,840
warm greetings from IMC and on this Monday morning we begin

152
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:34,399
a new five-part theme and uh the the topic of this week

153
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,919
will be quarrels what the Buddha had to say about quarrels and

154
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:46,519
disputes and the overall kind of uh context for teaching this is that since

155
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:53,240
the beginning of the year I've been somewhat emphasizing or focusing on the

156
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,480
the teachings having the practice of uh challenges what are the things that what

157
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:06,360
do we do with the challenges in our lives and how do we be with them and practice with them and one of the big challenges is

158
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:14,159
the conflicts we have with other people and others in the world quarrels

159
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:21,360
disputes hostilities that exist that and so um so that's the topic

160
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:29,720
for this week and maybe it's somewhat topical that uh as world events take

161
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:36,639
more Center Stage uh it seems that there's no shortage of growing

162
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:43,039
divisiveness growing quarrels disputes that people are living with and

163
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,760
um and or worried about so taking a maybe a Buddhist perspective maybe a

164
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,039
different perspective than usual on this uh you'll find

165
00:31:54,399 --> 00:32:02,639
valuable and um so the Buddha addressed quarrels and disputes quite a bit uh it

166
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:10,080
seems that just in our world just like in our world that was a common phenomenon in the ancient world uh the

167
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,200
ones that sometimes came closest to him uh in terms of his context his his uh

168
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,919
was the fact that the religious communities of his time the different spiritual Seekers and practitioners and

169
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:30,279
and teachers that they um it was an active active environment of debates and

170
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:37,039
people would actively debate uh in order to uh conquer uh their their opponent to

171
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:44,760
defeat them uh one such person came to the Buddha uh once and said um you know to

172
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,840
challenge him kind of challenging him in this kind of competitive quarrelsome kind of environment of different

173
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:57,120
religious teachings and asked to maybe kind of in a belligerent way uh or

174
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:05,159
challenging way uh what is it that you teach and the Buddha said um uh I teach

175
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:14,159
that by which we have no quarrels with anyone in the world and um and just hearing that the

176
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:23,080
person was somehow Disturbed upset uh disgusted and uh left right

177
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,480
away just walked away maybe realizing that um the Buddha was not going to

178
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:36,080
engage in doctrinal quarrels and debates so but it's also a profound

179
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,279
thing that the Buddha said you know I teach that by which we are not in

180
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:50,159
quarrel with anybody in the world and um so the question is what does quarreling mean but to be but uh be

181
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,960
arguing with people that there's there anything we have to argue about and quarrel about is there another

182
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:02,159
alternative and when Buddha talks about um uh

183
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:10,158
quarrels uh one of the one of the primary ways he talks about it over and over again is in personal terms how we

184
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:17,240
can look at ourselves to find out the source of quarrels in ourselves what are the conditions that we live in within

185
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:23,638
within us our psychological conditions that bring us to a situation where we are quarreling and arguing

186
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:31,720
argumentatively with people in a hostile way and um and it's a little unsatisfying to

187
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:37,320
have the Buddha always pointing back to oneself because aren't some quarrels um

188
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:43,760
interpersonal we have to also find a way to engage interpersonally uh in order to work out

189
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,638
what's going on understand what's going on and um and if we don't we don't quarrel if we don't confront people who

190
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:57,079
are doing Injustice or doing something wrong are we just going to continue allow them to do that and we just go and

191
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:03,760
meditate and get calm and kind of uh check out in a sense and I don't think that's what the

192
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,800
Buddha is teaching uh he's not someone who checked out he was someone who his

193
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,880
own way he lived his life he was constantly showing up and meeting people

194
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,760
where they were at and engaging people and um but he did it with such great

195
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:26,280
wisdom and care that we're still his his teachings were recorded and we're still some of us are still finding ourselves

196
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:37,599
quite inspire ired by him so he was an Effective Teacher so um quarrels so uh many

197
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:43,680
there's a number of uh uh uh examples or records of different people coming to

198
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:53,400
the Buddha and asking questions like why is it that people quarrel and um and one of them um and so

199
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,720
I'll talk about a few of them this week but uh the probably one of the oldest

200
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:06,680
versions of this maybe from the earliest time in the Buddhist teaching career where it wasn't so greatly developed yet

201
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:13,920
he has a very simple series of uh layers within us that are that as the layers

202
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,560
get activate each other higher and higher into more activated States we end up

203
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:26,319
quarreling and um and so he describes these someone comes and says you know why do people quarrel and dispute so

204
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:32,440
much and so the Buddha then gives the the condition within us that has to be in

205
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:38,960
place in order for us to be in a ready to quarrel and then the question is well where does that come from or what is the

206
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,240
condition that and then the Buddha goes deeper deeper layer inside deeper layer

207
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:51,560
and one way of understanding these layers that the Buddha describes is that he's describing layers of

208
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:58,200
activation reactivation the way we get reactive and that uh the more activated

209
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:05,359
we are more reactive we become the more we're triggered to become even more reactive to get more

210
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,560
activated and as we get more activated one of the effects it has sometimes on

211
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,040
our attention is that the more activated we are the more constricted the

212
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:21,079
attention is the more it becomes focused narrowed on a particular concern

213
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:26,359
particular topic particular perspective we have for looking upon the world and

214
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:33,040
we might be looking at it through the world through the P perspective of only our hurt only our anger only our

215
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:42,680
hostility we might be looking at it to the perspective only that person is wrong and and um or that person is evil

216
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:48,839
or something and or I'm wrong or I'm Miss whatever and so that it'ss Laro and

217
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:56,760
narrow the focus the thinking becomes Tighter and more constricted so the Buddha when he starts

218
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,960
going through the different describing the layers going deeper and deeper he's describing layers to get calmer and

219
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:10,560
calmer more and more settled and if we understand it this way then we understand that uh the Buddha

220
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:18,839
keeps looking at this from the point of view of how we can practice with it and not so we can become calm the

221
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:25,440
point is not to become calm or peaceful and then just like not care anymore and just kind of go on with our business not

222
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,880
caring about the fact that people are harming us or harming others or that we

223
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:37,960
have differences of opinion or but rather that as we get calm enough and

224
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:44,599
centered enough then um we have available to us uh a a much more

225
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:51,319
intelligent creative way of thinking our thinking is not going to be caught up in the constricted way we're focusing on

226
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:57,480
something our thinking is not part and parcel of the reactivity that we have

227
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:05,760
and and uh and rather than reactive consideration of the conflict um we have

228
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,640
access to deeper Wellsprings of understanding wisdom sensitivity that

229
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:18,359
takes much more into account a broader wider field of concern and consideration

230
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:23,920
than is is possible when we're deeply relaxed then then we're very tense and

231
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,200
everything's gotten constricted so in this earlier descriptions of the

232
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:36,079
Genesis of of quarrel the personal Genesis of it inside of us

233
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:43,359
um the Buddha says that uh the uh that in order for quarreling to be present

234
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:49,400
the immediate condition and for this in this teaching he's doing there's other teachings so don't take this as being

235
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:56,200
the final word or the only word maybe it has to do with the particular person he was talking to that he described it this

236
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:02,040
way um but the principle is what I want to emphasize here not the accuracy of each

237
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:08,040
of these points so The Bu Buddha asks you know someone ask the Buddha what's the you

238
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:15,200
know from where from where does quarreling come what is the condition from which it comes the Buddha answerers

239
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,400
it comes from liking and not liking having preferences about things we like

240
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,839
something we don't like something we prefer one thing we prefer something else and um if we can realize are

241
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:32,160
quarreling our disputes or arguing and argumented we might have a chance then

242
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:38,960
to notice that underneath that we have a strong preferences small strong things we want to have and not want to have we

243
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,920
like we don't like and then the question is where does that come from within us and we drop

244
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:53,240
down another layer and as we drop a layer it becomes a little bit calmer State and then from there it says that

245
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:59,560
in order to have preferences or liking and not liking the condition for that is

246
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:06,079
desire and now not all desires are wrong not all liking and disliking is wrong

247
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,839
but as we but they are activated States and so we notice that as we relax the

248
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:18,319
liking and not liking we notice we have a preference we have a desire uh desire not for one thing over

249
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:24,640
another but we have some deeper form of Desire that is calmer than the activated

250
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,760
state of acting on liking and not liking and um and where does desire come

251
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,920
from and the answer there is that it comes from and um uh things being either

252
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:44,280
Pleasant or unpleasant that um the um uh the experience of

253
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:50,400
pleasantness or things are something are comfortable or nice for us to experience other things are not nice or

254
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:57,599
unpleasant uh to be able to kind of be present for that level of pleasant and unpleasant is a calmer more open state

255
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:05,760
of awareness so quarrels is very constricted attention uh liking and not liking is

256
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,960
less constrictive there's more move movement and attention and it's more open dropping further the idea is just

257
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:19,000
having simple desire and aware that we have desire then we're not caught up in the object of Desire the object what we

258
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,359
like and not like and so we're more settled and relaxed we see we have desire if we relax the desire we see

259
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:32,240
that we're operating in relationship to things being Pleasant and unpleasant there's nothing necessarily

260
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:39,079
wrong with Pleasant or unpleasant but it's a what's nice about it is that we're much more settled when we're just

261
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:44,680
tuning into the direct experience Here and Now of how things are Pleasant and

262
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:50,680
unpleasant and then where does pleasant and unpleasant come from and then the Buddha says it comes

263
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:57,400
from sense contact just kind of the the sense feelings that we have in our body

264
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:03,960
uh there's sense contact from that there's Pleasant and unpleasant from unpleasant Pleasant unpleasant there

265
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,640
becomes desires from desires there becomes liking and not liking

266
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:16,160
preferences and once we have liking and and and preferences then there are we can get quarrels when we can't get what

267
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:22,040
we want it's a very simple maybe simplistic discussion but uh the

268
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:28,400
important point I want to say is is moving down through the layers and coming to a place where if we can just

269
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,400
be aware and a relaxed open present moment awareness mindfully present for

270
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,319
the sense contact just the the open awareness to sense contact as they come and

271
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:46,480
go then we don't have the constricted mind then we have this greater

272
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:54,880
sensitivity and from there we can tap into what the Buddha called um uh the uh

273
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:01,400
contemplation or thinking from the womb from a deeper Source within a generative

274
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:07,760
gestational Source within that is not a reactive way of thinking but something

275
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:16,040
that doesn't come from reactivity but comes from a deep wisdom deep inner source of con consideration of openness

276
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:21,760
sensitivity and from that place we can now consider the conflict that we have

277
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:28,040
with other people from a very different perspective than if we do it from uh

278
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,559
caught up in the argument and yelling at people so the Budd the reason the Buddha

279
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:38,880
focuses on on self uh really take a deep look at

280
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,960
ourselves is not to dismiss the fact there's conflict but that's where we can do the

281
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:50,520
most important work sometimes to come to a place where we are ready to enter into

282
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:57,119
the to discuss the conflict with someone in the best state of mind the best state of heart is possible

283
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:04,079
and um and so this is one of the reasons why meditation is so useful if meditation helps us to

284
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:10,640
deactivate uh we're diffusing ourselves um and um disarming ourselves

285
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,800
from our the kind of intensity of the way we're angry or upset that uh is not

286
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:23,280
going to cause anybody any good and we're trying to not deny what's happening or deny ourselves but then

287
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:31,680
come in from the best place possible so that's the beginning and

288
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,440
um thank you very much for being here and I hope that this discussion this

289
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,640
week on quarrels will make our world at least the local world around us a more

290
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:50,920
peaceful and um um and

291
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:57,880
um and compassionate world thank you
