1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,200
all right good morning good day

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:13,040
um it's great to see uh the chat messages flowing in and so feel a sense

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,200
of connection with you

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:27,400
all so this week I will be with you um for this 7 a.m.

5
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,200
I want to say a few words about uh the theme I have in mind uh for this week's

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,280
um both meditation and um uh dared and

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,039
I'll short uh I'll speak about the dared uh later on um but I want to offer

8
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:03,360
some uh guiding words about um uh the meditation this

9
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,720
morning and some of you may have been on the two we Retreat that just

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:17,799
finished and we were exploring uh the breath and so this week and I wanted to

11
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:25,600
kind of expand uh our meditation by exploring the overall uh

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:33,520
inner kind of um inner Dynamics or inner dimensions of

13
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,880
our being and the metaphor I use is as if we're exploring

14
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:47,000
nature and a opening to the nature within ourselves that's

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,079
embodied that involves uh various um aspect of mind

16
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:58,439
and heart and I might be using some of the

17
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:05,280
nature metaph Force for us to explore this and we'll be starting with the

18
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,840
First Quality and that's embodied um that has a sense of a

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:20,720
grounding for us and will build uh a kind of a progression uh over this next

20
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,519
over the course of the week um in this next few

21
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:33,599
days and so hopefully I we'll be able to discover something within and that this

22
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,800
nature within ourselves and

23
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,800
so let's begin I'm going to start with the sound of a

24
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,800
[Music] bell riding along with the sound of a

25
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,720
bell to arrive

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,360
arriving arriving

27
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:19,720
here opening to the felt sense of arriving

28
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:27,400
here maybe the sense of space is

29
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:34,000
palpable the outer space and the Inner

30
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:46,519
Space and arriving now this

31
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,439
moment I'm reminded that in Chinese after

32
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:05,599
often here and now has an

33
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:12,519
emphatic expression this

34
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,319
place this

35
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,160
moment arriving at where we are

36
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,199
and how we

37
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,360
are without demanding things to be

38
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,199
otherwise maybe feeling and sensing the overall sense of the

39
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,360
body sitting lying

40
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,680
down or whatever posture you're taking right

41
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:36,240
now if a few long deep breaths allows for deeper sense of arriving and

42
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,319
connecting with Here and

43
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,319
Now inviting a few long deep

44
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,919
breath and as you breathe

45
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,639
out settle down

46
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,720
here

47
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,880
deeper a sense of a mindfulness may become a little more

48
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,880
continuous

49
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:43,009
with moment to moment meing with our [Music]

50
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:55,000
experience and there may be a sense of a heartfulness whatever this word might

51
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,919
mean to you you don't have to figure spr

52
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,199
out for me there is just a sense of

53
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:18,560
opening and easing up in the heart

54
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:27,280
space maybe the chest torso

55
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,240
becoming available

56
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:12,240
the momentary experiences are always available to

57
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,080
us are you available to the moment

58
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,880
what's the felt sense of a being available to

59
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:58,720
you there may be a global sense of relaxation and ease

60
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:17,959
the sense of a body resting down or resting back

61
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,839
gently turn your attention to the lower half of the

62
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:54,519
body if you're sitting maybe feeling and sensing the

63
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:00,360
pelvic pelvic floor connecting

64
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,000
with the Earth underneath

65
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
chairs

66
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,800
couch and if you're lying down and

67
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:28,079
standing gently turn the attention to where the body make the

68
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,160
contact with with the Earth

69
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:48,160
underneath and sensing the firmness of the

70
00:10:52,120 --> 00:11:00,320
bones in this body there is a Earth element

71
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,800
in the

72
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,639
body that is firm

73
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,639
solid

74
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:27,120
heavy like the sit bones rooted on Earth

75
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:45,880
feeling and sensing this earthy body resting on

76
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,560
earth like oders in the

77
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:21,959
riverbed what's the felt sense of the earthy body for

78
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:37,320
you you don't need to think about it trusting your own felt

79
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,040
sense maybe it's a

80
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:05,320
silent the Earth element in the body is a relatively

81
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:17,800
steady still and quiet

82
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:38,120
releasing the momentum to try to figure it

83
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,920
out trusting your F

84
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:03,440
sense sitting like a mountain

85
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,839
within there may be a sense of [Music]

86
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:21,839
grounding grounding in the Earth element in the body

87
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:50,600
so fortunate that this body naturally can

88
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,040
ground releasing the body

89
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,120
to the gift of

90
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,839
gravity sitting like a

91
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
mountain

[Music]

119
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,360
so thank you everyone for your practice and uh

120
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:07,600
I feel the kind of quiet and silence here and it's

121
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:16,200
nice I want to offer a few words about um what uh I was thinking about sharing

122
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:25,600
this week uh in terms of a darad and so uh there is a short

123
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:32,919
sutta in samik AA the poly Canon that has been rather alive in

124
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:38,919
me and this is Samaya

125
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:47,919
22101 and those of you who are interesting looking it up and the sua has a few very

126
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,360
interesting similes and the Buddha used uh to kind

127
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,440
of describe some of the uh overarching

128
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:10,519
characteristics of how we cultivate and um develop uh various um capacities and

129
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:17,480
skills and uh like many of the short sutas the Sam nikaya sutas usually are

130
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:24,600
rather short um they often start with uh quite

131
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:33,760
a um dramatic or um kind of empathe and uh empathetic

132
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:39,240
kind of uh statement and unlike uh so kind of like

133
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:47,760
all the other sutas in many other sutas in saman nikaya this sutta also started

134
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:56,320
out with um a um emphatic statement about destruction

135
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:04,679
of the thingss so some of you may have heard this uh phrase uh which often is kind

136
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:10,919
of um related to um Awakening Liberation

137
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:16,919
ending Dua and uh gil on this Retreat that just

138
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:25,120
finished also used the word sting or removing of a sting in the mind that

139
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,639
kind of block us to see things

140
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:36,760
clearly and so it opened up with uh this

141
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:46,519
statement I say that the destruction of the tins is for one who knows and

142
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:53,480
sees not for one who does not know and does not

143
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:03,760
see I'm going to pause let the word settle I'm going to read this again see

144
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:11,960
it's just just kind of um feel what the effect of this statement for you I say

145
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,398
that the destruction of the T is for one who knows and

146
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:25,240
sees not for one who does not know and does not see

147
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:41,320
I kind of feel the power of this statement sometimes I would get goosebumps reading it I didn't have it

148
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:48,960
today um and then um like many of this short

149
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,760
sutas you follow on by saying what is it that one sees and

150
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:04,200
knows um that LE Le to this uh this way of being and so it is seeing the arising

151
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:11,599
and passing away of the five Aggregates so this week I won't talk

152
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:18,040
about the five Aggregates and because this is a quite um ex um um quite a

153
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:24,920
teaching um on in its own right so what I will be doing is to offer just a few

154
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,119
words about this um um but then focus on

155
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:36,240
the cultivation and development aspect of what the suut is talking

156
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:45,079
about and so five Aggregates are uh kind of ways that the Buddha is pointing at

157
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:51,760
um how some of this major humanly processes that are uh in the body mind

158
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,079
and heart that we tend to get entangled in them

159
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:06,880
and the Buddha is inviting us to really know and see this humanly processes in

160
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,760
the way they are and that they are impermanent and they're not something

161
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:22,920
for us to grasp in or clean um and yet

162
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:32,079
um in this kind of logical intellectually it's not so hard to

163
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:38,160
understand we all know our body changes our mind changes and uh we have all this

164
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:46,359
different processes are constantly changing but just knowing

165
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:56,200
this you know doesn't always seems to take us out from our cleaning to this uh

166
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:02,040
humanly process thees and that's in in the body mind and

167
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:09,640
heart and so I want to just kind of pause right now right here to reflect

168
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:16,680
about back what is this knowing and a

169
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,359
seeing and so in the meditation this morning I was using a

170
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:34,800
phrase again again that is felt sense or feeling and sensing our way

171
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:44,280
in and for me this phrase often uh as pointing to uh the aspect of dropping

172
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:51,520
out of maybe conceptual overlays our ideas about what our

173
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:58,160
experiences are but rather letting this um embody

174
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:07,000
a capacity to feel and sense what's here and maybe in fact we kind of

175
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:14,920
release a lot of this layers of ideas and conceptual

176
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,400
overlays and yet um this kind of a knowing and the seeing are not always

177
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:27,240
easily available to us and I uh was a flying home this uh

178
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:33,880
last last uh weekend from a training Retreat and I was uh sitting in the

179
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:39,599
airplane in the evening time and the flight was taking off and I was wearing

180
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:45,440
a sunglasses um after a while and I

181
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,040
noticed just right around the wing outside of the window formed this kind

182
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:58,319
of rainbow color um uh kind of layer and

183
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:04,960
it was you know quite miraculous uh just kind of seeing it and

184
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:13,240
being with it it was very beautiful I was just kind of paying attention to this for quite a long while

185
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:20,720
and then at some point I kind of realized oh I was wearing a sunglasses so I took my

186
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:27,040
sunglasses out oh it was kind of a brown and a gray

187
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,560
all of a sudden you know the whole rainbow color layer just

188
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,780
disappeared and that was a that was a little moment of like

189
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:45,319
[Laughter] disappointment um but this is kind of uh

190
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:52,960
the way that often times without cultivation and development with our of

191
00:39:52,960 --> 00:40:01,480
our heart and mind we can be related to our world through a lot of different

192
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,920
kind of filters uh Concepts ideas views beliefs

193
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:15,760
that may be formed a decades or lifetimes and not realizing that we're seeing and knowing

194
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,920
through this and so this felt sense allow us to

195
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:31,078
drop in um in a much more kind of deeper immediacy of know KN and feeling our

196
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:41,760
way and so in the sua the Buddha went on by saying that this kind of knowing and

197
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,960
seeing is um will become available through kind of

198
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:56,560
wholehearted and proper cultivation and development and without cultivation and

199
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:04,720
development uh we will operate in kind of a habitual ways of relating to our experiences

200
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:10,480
through this kind of a filters that distort the

201
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:18,960
reality and so in this sutta the Buddha um kind of took a turn you know he did

202
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,960
not elaborate on the five Aggregates and but um he pointed

203
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:32,599
out how we may have to really give ourselves to a cultivation and

204
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:38,480
development and the cultivation is and and development that the Buddha point

205
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:46,119
out in the sua is the 37 uh wings of Awakening some of you would know you

206
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:52,480
know it includes the four foundations of a mindfulness for right effort and I'll

207
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,240
say dot dot dot all the way to seven factors of Awakening and and eight noble

208
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:07,280
and um the Noble eight-fold Path and it's so it's a through this

209
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:14,000
cultivation and uh again this week we're not going to elaborate on this 37 wings

210
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:22,319
of Awakening um many of you know um various aspects of this and I take that the

211
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:27,839
Buddha wasn't saying that you have to just you know do all of this but

212
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:35,160
uh there is a set of specific cultivation and that we must engage in

213
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:43,880
for us uh to begin to open up to this different way of seeing and

214
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:51,839
knowing and in fact in the susut the Buddha

215
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:57,839
said uh if someone develops their mind and heart anyway

216
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:05,640
uh in this way you know one of the 37 wings of um Awakening one of those

217
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:13,400
lists um even if they didn't have the wish to awaken it'll happen because this

218
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:20,280
it's the nature of this cultivation and the development it's very natural uh for

219
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:30,280
this um way of knowing and seeing that is undistorted to become accessible and

220
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:37,880
available and so this is a very kind of you don't have to wish that we will kind

221
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:44,839
of destruct the Anda um but instead if we give ourselves

222
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:50,559
over to the cultivation in the proper way this will

223
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:57,880
happen and so that's very different from kind of a goal or result oriented go

224
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:05,839
culture and then in the rest of the suta I'll give you a teaser right now that um

225
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:14,000
the Buddha used three different similes to highlight some different aspects of

226
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,880
how we cultivate um and used the simile of a

227
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:27,119
chicken and eggs and the second simile is using this

228
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:34,599
the holding uh eyes and the last assimile is this rope

229
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:43,240
used to Anchor um a ship and uh we'll unpack this assimile

230
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:51,760
for for the rest of the week and um I think uh you have a little overview

231
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,160
for the sua today and uh we'll end right here

232
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:06,119
so thank you everyone for your um practice and sharing this precious uh

233
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:14,119
practice space and so may you all have a wonderful rest of the day
