1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,080
so welcome welcome everyone and welcome anyone online watching

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,839
very happy to be here today my name is dawn neal and i'm a long time practitioner in this

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:23,840
i've been teaching for about 10 years and we're just going to sit together so

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,240
the invitation is to settle back

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,399
into a comfortable yet alert posture

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,039
it can be helpful to start with two or three intentional breaths

7
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,480
perhaps a bit deeper than normal

8
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,280
allowing any excess tension to flow outwards on the out breath

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,040
letting go on the out breathe

10
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:35,159
and allowing the breathing to return to normal whatever that is for you today

11
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,720
taking a moment to establish awareness establish mindfulness

12
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:59,840
in this body noticing the details of your posture

13
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,200
noticing sensations

14
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,640
warmth or cool

15
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,760
tension or relaxation

16
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,400
perhaps allowing acknowledgments of sound

17
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,599
and acknowledging any energy left over from what it took

18
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,120
to get to your meditation spot

19
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,840
and allowing the heart the mind to rest

20
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:22,080
to settle into whatever meditation anchor primary

21
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,720
object

22
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,239
feels most hospitable

23
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,000
perhaps the sensations of the body

24
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,480
especially the sensations of breathing

25
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:22,720
allowing thoughts of then were there to fade to the periphery

26
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,840
and settling into here into this

27
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,160
this moment

28
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,240
allowing your awareness to become intimate

29
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,080
with the felt sense at this moment

30
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,600
allowing sounds to come and go

31
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,160
sensations to come and go

32
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,840
creating each arising

33
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:49,479
what's this breath like this moment

34
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,840
inviting awareness to suffuse through the entire body

35
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:01,638
inviting the body to soften relax

36
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,080
if a sensation or sound or thought pulls the attention

37
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,879
away the suggestion is to gently

38
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,319
kindly acknowledge it

39
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,680
and allow the attention to settle back

40
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,680
riding waves of breath or sensation

41
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,599
or the general felt sense of being here

42
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,840
now

43
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,000
from time to time refreshing the awareness

44
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:25,360
noticing mindfulness perhaps re-emerging

45
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,920
or perhaps continuous and steady

46
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:38,279
either way appreciating the awareness of this moment

47
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,040
uh

48
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,440
for the last five minutes or so of this meditation

49
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:44,120
the invitation if the mindfulness awareness feels steady

50
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,519
is to take an internal step back

51
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:58,880
allowing everything to come and go

52
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,440
in a broad skylike awareness opening up

53
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:15,398
noticing whatever appears and goes away again

54
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,919
and in the last moment or two of this meditation

55
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,399
noticing any calm softness

56
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:36,720
perhaps a touch more attention or clarity or mindfulness

57
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,720
appreciating any benefits of this meditation

58
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,200
noticing taking it in

59
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:08,480
and then with that in your heart and mind calling to mind

60
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,240
the other people and other beings in your life

61
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:20,720
here in this room near your home

62
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:31,679
your neighborhood anyone get your own contact with

63
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,840
and see perhaps if it's possible to

64
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,278
generate the intention the resolve

65
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:53,480
to meet them with kind receptive appreciative awareness

66
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:59,840
to share the goodness of this practice

67
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,200
as you move through your life

68
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,709
[Music]

69
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,679
so welcome everyone morning

70
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,400
so i'm gonna start this talk with a story this is from the kind of fables um

71
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,000
the myths of early buddhism called the jataka tales

72
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,119
and it is the story it's sort of a story within a story

73
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,800
there's the buddha who is in a retreat with

74
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,240
several very senior monks and during the retreat

75
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,920
four or five of them experience full awakening and

76
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,119
before he comes to speak with them after they break the silence they're talking

77
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:46,800
and each of them was doing a different practice so some were meditating on the four

78
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,839
elements that some of you have heard about others are

79
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:59,280
practicing with breathing or different aspects of their experience like their senses eyes ears

80
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,960
nose taste and their experiences of awakening are

81
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,079
different and they're confused by this and they ask him when he comes

82
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,000
and he tells them this story that

83
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,880
in the distant past the king of varanasi had four princes

84
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,160
and in conversation with these princes

85
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,599
a certain sort of very unusual tree came up

86
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,640
and it was like a king sukka tree in pali but that would

87
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,040
roughly translate as a what do you call it tree right okay so it's kind of goofy whatever it

88
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,480
is and um he describes it a little bit to them and

89
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,520
they're all fascinated by the idea of seeing this tree

90
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,119
but you know princes are busy and you know even though they didn't have iphones they had full schedules so one

91
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:07,040
at a time at different times the charioteer took them to this distant forest

92
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:13,920
to see this tree and eventually maybe six months later a year

93
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,480
later they're in conversation again and this tree comes up and each of them describe how they saw

94
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,760
the tree and one says well it was kind of like a charred stump with just these

95
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:32,560
little green specks on it little buds and the other goes no no no we saw something different we saw

96
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:40,240
a tree with flame-like leaves all over it and yet another one said well

97
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:47,359
no i saw a brown tree with big whumpy fruit and then the last one was like no this

98
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,200
was like a shrub with these gorgeous flowers all over it and the

99
00:37:53,200 --> 00:38:00,240
king just sort of looks at the princes and said why didn't any of you ask the charioteer

100
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,240
about what kind of conditions were at play around this tree that's the same tree

101
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,440
it's in different seasons with different amounts of water

102
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:18,560
and i like this story because what the buddha is pointing to by telling it to his monks is there are all these

103
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:26,079
different kinds of ways that awakening can show up and that practice shows up

104
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:34,560
and the experience can look different depending on how we're practicing

105
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,560
of the big awakening but also the little awakenings of awareness too right

106
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,160
so tonight i'm going to talk about one of these methods one of these practices or today this

107
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,560
morning i'm going to talk about one of these methods which is recognizing the many many different

108
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,720
forms that mindfulness mindful awareness or awareness can take i'm using those

109
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:06,320
terms synonymously so this is what the buddha calls the third

110
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,400
foundation of mindfulness and kind of shading into the fourth if that's not familiar to you you don't

111
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:20,640
have to track it but it's quality of our minds and quality of how we relate to what's in them basically

112
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:26,240
and just like the whatchamacallit tree awareness can show up very differently

113
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,320
depending on the different conditions and depending on what's being observed

114
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,920
whether it's breath or sound or emotion

115
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,119
can feel different it's kind of like um old landscape

116
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:49,839
painters understood this very well like the quality of light happening in a day

117
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:56,400
you don't notice it as much if it's just a cloud this sky right but if there's clouds

118
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,160
trees rocks houses fields the quality of light becomes apparent

119
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:10,520
through what it strikes the same is true of awareness and what we're aware of

120
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,000
so part of broadening and maturing

121
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:24,880
awareness practice mindfulness practice is recognizing all of these different forms that awareness can take

122
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,160
and i'm going to describe them as different experiences but but in

123
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:36,560
reality they all shade into each other they all overlap they're like a continuum even

124
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,839
and they're all good i'm going to go through them progressively but there's no need to

125
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:47,520
rank them because any complete moment of mindfulness is an opening

126
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,520
and a possibility into waking up

127
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:59,920
so broadly in the next few minutes i'm going to describe mindful awareness as

128
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,599
the tree with the buds with the weebs with the flowers and with the fruit and then i'm going to talk for

129
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,400
a few minutes about the forest so

130
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,920
moment-to-moment mindfulness is like those little buds on that tree

131
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,839
one breath at a time one sensation at a time

132
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:30,880
noticing each one in its particularity as it comes up and as it goes away

133
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:37,920
most of us begin to notice this process when we first start sitting meditation

134
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,000
and it can feel a little bit like labor to bring the mind back to it right

135
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:52,160
we can also notice another example of this is sensations which broadly might be

136
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:59,200
you know back pain for example like a spot in my back but when i really look closely it's all

137
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:07,119
these scintillating little star-like sensations coming and going and there's not actually a border around it

138
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:13,200
but just moving in and out coming and going

139
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,960
sometimes with moment-to-moment mindfulness little bursts of many moments in a row

140
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,240
will happen this sometimes happens when sitting right it feels like it's going easily

141
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,319
flowing that's a certain kind of momentum and there's another kind of momentum too

142
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:38,319
which you may have noticed which is throughout your day or maybe innocent

143
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:45,760
a little bit of awareness will just pop in without you doing anything at all

144
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,880
it just arises

145
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:58,560
another form of this like simple level of mindfulness

146
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,960
is something i call wholehearted presence or open-hearted presence and this is where

147
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:13,119
everything is more of a wash it's the completeness it's just the sense of being present here and now

148
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:20,880
so there's not any particular object of attention rather there is um

149
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,960
just a sense of being here and

150
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,240
in daily life this can manifest as

151
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,680
a tuning mindfulness when there's more going on to rather than trying to track for

152
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:45,760
example i'm not going to try to track my breathing when i'm driving right i'm focused on driving

153
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,560
it can also mean noticing like for example

154
00:43:52,560 --> 00:44:00,319
when i am walking with a friend just oh here i am walking with my friend

155
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:05,680
it's being present at the very simplest level it's

156
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:11,599
also the capacity to simply be with whatever is going on

157
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:17,119
right so if intense emotion is arising for me

158
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:23,078
being with that just being with it

159
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,720
so um there's a way of

160
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:34,240
lensing in and out between these two different forms of moment-to-moment

161
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,440
awareness i remember like i sat a long long

162
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,560
retreat actually two long retreats one at ims in massachusetts and the second one in

163
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,920
burma and when i got back my awareness was attuned

164
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,599
to all the little changes in each moment very subtle well shortly after that i started

165
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,720
volunteering as a hospital chaplain i felt like i'd been

166
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,640
i was a violin that had been thrown into a frenzy dance floor it was just like

167
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,000
and it's because i hadn't yet learned to pull back open the lens of awareness

168
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,640
and just take in the whole wash of what was happening and as soon as that happened it felt

169
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:26,078
quite easily so there's this focusing in and pulling outwards

170
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:33,040
sometimes this um simple meeting of mindfulness as it is

171
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:40,480
can just be like a brightening or perhaps like a gong striking

172
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:46,400
just richer flavors and food right

173
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:54,000
and moments of clarity can arise inside of this kind of like shooting stars when we get those meteor showers

174
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,599
i went up to a local bihara a few years ago this was pre-coveted and was hanging out with some of my

175
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,960
friends there and we were lying in this field at night looking up at the stars

176
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,319
and every once in a while a meteor would go by right

177
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:15,520
but then just like when mindfulness momentum builds we started getting more

178
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:21,680
and more and more of these one after another one after another

179
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:28,880
showering through so when continuity of mindfulness builds

180
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:36,240
these shooting stars can happen more and more often and every now and then no matter how often they happen

181
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,839
a bigger star might come through a bigger meteor oh

182
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:47,040
insight can happen at any minute

183
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,960
so second level of attention if you want to imagine the tree again

184
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,880
perhaps the tree leafing out this is the step back

185
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:08,640
in awareness so there's this massive difference

186
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:15,200
when there's even the slightest difference between an experience and the knowing of it

187
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:21,119
i was walking with a dear friend recently and she had started a mindfulness practice

188
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,240
kind of recently and i asked her what have you noticed what's different and she said

189
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:32,640
it's so huge when i'm stressed i can just notice that i'm stressed

190
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:38,880
right that distance no longer being hooked into the story that the stress is making but just like

191
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:45,520
oh stress okay or oh relaxation great

192
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:56,480
stephen covey has been known to describe victor frankel's understanding

193
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:02,319
as in this quote that he found in a library stack somewhere roughly it states

194
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:09,920
between stimulus and response as a space and within that space there's a choice

195
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,318
and therein lies freedom right

196
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:24,640
one of the things that can really help make space is a sense of humor and the practice playfulness

197
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:31,839
and i used to think i was kind of cheating by doing this um on long retreats i would sort of invent

198
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:38,160
these things so i'll tell you one like there was this one retreat that i was just really caught up in resentment

199
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:45,119
about something for the life of me i have no idea what it was anymore but that grudge was just kind of

200
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:50,160
weighing on the mind and pulling it in and eventually the mind made it into

201
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:55,839
this little troll like this little squat you know with ears and hair coming out

202
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:01,920
the ears and just really hammed it up and made it silly and imagine the trolls stomping back and forth as being the

203
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,040
grudge and that created enough distance from

204
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:14,640
the experience to be able to hold it lightly and eventually it just went away right

205
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:20,160
like i said i kind of thought i was cheating about this until um

206
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,680
i heard joseph goldstein talk about playing kind of atari with his thoughts

207
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:31,520
and like shooting and letting them kind of explode and disappear

208
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:37,520
so there's all these different ways of being playful that can help create this

209
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:44,640
second level of attention the knowing we're aware the knowing that we're in an emotional state

210
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:49,599
right holding it lightly

211
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,280
we get to the flowering of awareness what in

212
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:02,480
the satipatana sutra the four foundations for awareness the four establishments of mindfulness

213
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:09,280
that's called full awareness and it talks about how a practitioner or a monk knows when

214
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:15,760
they're moving when they're reaching when they're eating when they're using the bathroom all these different daily

215
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,960
activities it's um for us maybe

216
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,400
walking i know i'm walking reaching for the refrigerator door i know i'm reaching

217
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:33,359
right that's at the body level but this full awareness this mindfulness

218
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:39,280
of context applies also to other things like what kind of

219
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:45,040
practice is helpful in this moment for example

220
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,000
what's helpful now

221
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,520
then there's um the awareness of conditions

222
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:04,880
also foot phil fits into this this full awareness i'm describing nepali is

223
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:12,720
of satisfying the bigger picture so

224
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:18,640
what kind of practice is helpful when i'm driving maybe it's just driving maybe it's seeing

225
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:25,839
right or having a tough day maybe it's loving kindness

226
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:33,680
mindfulness of conditions is part of this as well and that could

227
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:39,359
be as knowing the effects of what my mind or heart is doing on my

228
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:45,599
body softening in the chest

229
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:52,720
relaxation or a quenching in the neck tension

230
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,440
but noticing the relationship between these things

231
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:04,319
noticing our kind of internal ecosystem the internal

232
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:08,880
system of interactions that's happening

233
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:24,000
then we get to sort of the the tree bearing fruit

234
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,839
which is another level of satisfaction mindfulness and full awareness lucid

235
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:36,640
awareness as it starts to shade towards wisdom or discernment

236
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:43,760
and this is discernment one level of this discernment it's the quality of the heart and mind at the

237
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:50,800
moment right it can be um the quality of awareness how spacious is

238
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:57,040
it or how contracted is it is there distraction or concentration

239
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:04,240
is there greed or contentment just as simple as that

240
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:10,400
sometimes too there's almost a spatial component to it for some people i know

241
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,520
where it's like the awareness can feel close in and intimate

242
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:21,920
or it can feel like surfing the sensations of the

243
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:27,599
changes in the body and the mind can be kind of floating

244
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:33,280
or very grounded vast like the sky or as tiny as a little

245
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:39,599
pinhole sometimes it even feels like

246
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:45,359
being immersed in reality like that fish swimming through water

247
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:51,040
suddenly realizing there's water there wow yeah

248
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:58,640
it can even feel like being steeped like there's no separation awareness inward

249
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:05,119
and outward so there's another kind of discernment

250
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:10,720
too which is perhaps more helpful even which is

251
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:17,359
discernment of what's helpful and unhelpful in our minds and hearts

252
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:24,720
what's helpful is that which leads to greater benefit for ourselves and others what's

253
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,839
unhelpful leads to greater affliction there's a few teachings in in the

254
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:36,160
ancient texts the pali canon where the buddha talks about this he teaches his son and

255
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:44,079
one of them and he just talks about a wise person and another a wise person is one who

256
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:50,240
acts for benefit for themselves for others for themselves and others and all

257
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:55,280
concerned an unwise person

258
00:54:55,359 --> 00:55:02,559
builds affliction and then themselves affliction in others affliction in both and for all concerned

259
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,680
and he the buddha suggests dividing thought and meditation

260
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:14,240
kind of along these lines on one side are the afflictive thoughts and on the other side are the beneficial

261
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:21,760
thoughts and he suggests keeping very close watch when there are

262
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,200
afflictive thoughts happening because there can be a cascade effect right

263
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:35,000
it talks about it being like a cow herd who keeps the cows away from the neighbor's crops very carefully

264
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:41,359
there's also when things are good noticing that too but appreciating it

265
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:46,000
allowing it to grow to extend

266
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:53,760
mindfulness in these contexts is sometimes described as a gatekeeper who is guarding a walled city

267
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,359
and the buddha was alive in the bronze age so there were more like i think individual

268
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:04,799
towns or cities with protection around them and the gatekeeper

269
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:10,480
knows the way for the important messengers to go straight to the king he also

270
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:16,160
has discernment in recognizing who's coming in that the king's guards might

271
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,520
want to keep a closer eye on or in extreme circumstances

272
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,960
who's trying to enter that he shouldn't let enter at all and our minds can be like that too the

273
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:34,000
mindfulness the discerning quality of our minds can just be as simple as not now

274
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,280
or i'm just not going to go there right

275
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:50,400
helpful qualities of the mind are also balanced by awareness

276
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:57,200
kind of like a chariot tear keeps horses in sync that's how it's described in the ancient

277
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,838
teachings

278
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:13,440
there's a quote that jack cornfield i believe has said i believe quoting annie lamont the writer

279
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:19,280
saying my mind is like a bad neighborhood i try not to go there alone

280
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:24,960
right so these

281
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:31,680
helpful qualities of minds are sometimes considered to be like seven friends

282
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:38,720
this is a poem based on the early teachings of the first

283
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:45,599
ordained monastic women in the buddhist order and this book is poems based on that by

284
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:50,960
maddie weingast called the first free women

285
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:56,480
and in it this awakened woman because of these or their awakening poems

286
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:04,480
is saying i was forever getting lost until one day the buddha told me

287
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:10,880
to walk this path you will need seven friends mindfulness

288
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:16,880
curiosity courage joy

289
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:23,838
stillness calm and perspective

290
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:32,000
for many years these friends and i have traveled together sometimes wandering in circles

291
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,079
sometimes taking a long way around

292
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:44,240
oh my heart you don't have to go it alone train yourself

293
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:49,960
to train just a little more gently

294
00:58:54,160 --> 00:59:02,318
those seven friends are the seven factors of awakening that translation's a little bit different than the normal one

295
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:10,720
so gentle gentle attention helps in recognizing

296
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,078
all these different forms of awareness

297
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:24,240
so there's another broadening of this sakti sampanchanda this full

298
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:30,559
awareness which is to notice the forest around the tree

299
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:37,839
venerable annalio highlights how important it is to balance internal awareness which we talk about a lot here

300
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:46,480
with external awareness awareness of other people living beings or life forms

301
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:53,839
awareness of our environment and he says the one of the reasons it's so important to balance internal and

302
00:59:53,839 --> 01:00:01,200
external is that there can be an over focus on the self an over self

303
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:06,720
absorption that happens if it all becomes about my experience

304
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:13,359
that can be balanced quite beautifully if we start noticing and practicing external mindfulness of others and their

305
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:18,559
experience so

306
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:23,920
while it can be helpful for to notice one thing at a time in this body that

307
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,920
tree that i keep mentioning it it's also helpful

308
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:35,519
to have the entire surrounding ecosystem in mind

309
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:43,359
in the hidden life of trees wallabong author talks about how trees actually

310
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:48,559
communicate through their roots with each other they send out signals

311
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:56,079
sometimes they're helped by the fungi beneath the forest floor they send each other nutrients warnings

312
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:04,400
they even help prop each other up quite literally when they're in this kind of symbiotic relationship

313
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:13,040
noticing others being present for others is another way

314
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:18,880
of building a symbiotic relationship a mutually helpful relationship

315
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:26,559
and this kind of awareness really draws on awareness of ourselves right

316
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:34,240
so i might notice a person's posture or expression and be able to infer a certain kind of

317
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:43,040
you know with humility with not lack of certainty a certain kind of perhaps awareness or emotional state or

318
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:50,319
gosh they look like they might be going through something maybe i should check on them like just so noticing with humility with the

319
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:57,200
possibility that you know i'm seeing this am i off here right i could be wrong

320
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:03,039
that is one way to start noticing external noticing people's body

321
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:09,680
movements is a much easier way like how they're walking if they're walking sitting

322
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:15,839
close or far but all of this can draw on the wisdom

323
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:21,200
the mindfulness that has been learned inside our bodies right

324
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:28,880
and that is tracking also internal and

325
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:35,440
external awareness those of you who are healthcare professionals or work

326
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:41,680
with people maybe therapists coaches whatnot we use this all the time checking in

327
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:47,760
with our own experience to get a sense of how to read the room it's like

328
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:53,440
a stringed instrument when a really heavy truck drives by and

329
01:02:53,440 --> 01:03:01,280
the building shakes the stringed instrument might hum in resonance right we're also humming in resonance

330
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:08,400
with everyone around us our nervous systems are the instrument our hearts are the instrument

331
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:20,559
noticing this provides space for something known as a non-complementary response

332
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:28,160
so this means for example i don't have to meet anger with anger

333
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:33,520
and my day job one of my my jobs as a hospital chaplain

334
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:39,520
and there are times where there might be a visiting family member that's very upset really angry

335
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:44,880
or grieving and there there's something so powerful

336
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:52,319
about being able to be with that person and feel that resonance without getting pulled into it

337
01:03:52,319 --> 01:04:00,079
it enables a sense of compassionate calm in meeting them and it can transform things

338
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:05,359
and help someone get further through their process or if they're upset it can help them

339
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:12,400
calm down very quickly because my instrument isn't caught in their instruments tuned i'm aware of it i'm

340
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:19,039
responding to it but i'm able to be with and each of this each of us has this

341
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:25,799
capacity um

342
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:33,680
also times when one's impact on others maybe isn't so

343
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:42,319
clear maybe i'm caught up in my head or i'm busy or i'm in a rush or something like that

344
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:49,280
and then we can notice how people are showing up in relationship to us

345
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:56,240
as a mirror to our own behavior lily tomlin talks about how

346
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:01,760
this famous quote people will forget what you said they will forget what you did but they

347
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:08,480
will never ever forget how you made them feel right

348
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:16,400
and we can often see it on people's faces in their bodies if something was a little off

349
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:22,559
it's important to say here too that this internal external awareness this

350
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:27,760
perceptions of other people is also precisely where bias can come in our own

351
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:34,319
filters so those can distort

352
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:41,039
the mirrors and they can also filter our perceptions including what we are even able to see

353
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:45,039
what's even able to be seen at all

354
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:53,280
and to how we see it like a number of you i sat a lot of home

355
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:58,480
retreat in the last two and a half plus years of this coveted pandemic

356
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:04,559
and i just remember on this one retreat it was during an informal time between sittings and i was like

357
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:10,799
walking through my apartment and the back wall of the apartment has a lot of windows on it and one of them

358
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:16,640
looks out onto a porch that my neighbor also has access to

359
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:22,160
and my eyes lit on a form on the porch

360
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:28,960
you know kind of brilliantly lit by the sunlight and almost before i could perceive what it

361
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:34,240
was there was a version and i could just because my mind was

362
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:40,319
quiet i could just watch the mind cascade through this story of oh my neighbor left that

363
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:46,960
stuff on the porch and then it like filtered the view of the neighbor too and it definitely filtered the view

364
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:52,640
of the object the really humbling thing about this is with the second look the object wasn't

365
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:59,200
what i thought it was at all it was conditioned by these attitudes in my mind they literally distorted what i

366
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:06,000
saw there are also people who

367
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,280
have described receiving an email when in an agitated state

368
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:17,440
and being convinced it says something not good

369
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:22,880
having the presence of mind not to respond to it going back to it later and realizing it actually said something

370
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:30,079
different the text was different than they read it to be the emotional state filtered the

371
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:34,880
information that much it distorted it that much

372
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:42,799
so one benefit of starting to notice awareness is notice when noticing when

373
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:48,240
there might be a little distortion at play oh i'm maybe i'm not in the best frame

374
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:55,400
of mind to be taking this in right now maybe i'll set it aside take it in later

375
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:05,039
so um internal and external awareness is where

376
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:12,160
we exercise some of our most important choices this includes what voices and

377
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:18,318
sources we amplify in our own hearts and minds that allow our own hearts and minds to move

378
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:23,679
in certain directions and it can also be

379
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:30,318
in noticing what we say or amplify and move on to others

380
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:36,080
right so um

381
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:41,520
the choices we make can be the difference between sort of cultivating trust

382
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:46,960
kindness honesty

383
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:52,640
awareness cultivating our sort of cultural and relational comments

384
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,718
as opposed to putting

385
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:03,520
agitation anger judgment fear

386
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:09,678
even untruths we run across without checking

387
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:16,159
we have the power to emit things that are more

388
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:22,318
wholesome versus things that cause more problems and agitation than the people we know or

389
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:25,040
don't even know

390
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:33,758
another gatekeeper story and then i'll be done here so

391
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:40,318
i don't remember if the story is in the sutas i think it may be sort of in the literature around the discourses

392
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:48,560
it's another gatekeeper and this gatekeeper is a friendly sort and

393
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:55,199
people ask him all kinds of questions and so one day one group

394
01:09:55,199 --> 01:10:02,560
kind of comes by and they're doing what they need to do to get them in the city and they ask say what are the people like here

395
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:07,840
the gatekeeper looks at them and goes well how did you find people in the town you left

396
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:14,560
oh they were awful greedy conniving couldn't trust them

397
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:20,719
always putting people down he just nods and he said i think you'll find people like that

398
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:28,640
here too next group comes by a few groups later

399
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:34,400
he gets the same question he gets this question a lot what are the people like here

400
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:40,640
oh they're kind trustworthy generous i feel blessed

401
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:47,520
to have them as neighbors back where i left i'm gonna miss him oh okay i think you'll find people here

402
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:53,440
much like that too right

403
01:10:53,440 --> 01:11:00,639
what we put out has a large impact on what we receive

404
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:08,560
so to recap the takeaway is that awareness can take

405
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:14,000
all of these different forms with different breadth and depth and

406
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:20,480
scope any of which all of which can be useful whether it's moment to moment

407
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:27,280
more of a general gestalt if it is more of a full awareness an encompassing

408
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:32,560
awareness or a discernment like that whatchamacallit tree and all

409
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:37,840
the fruits and blossoms and buds eventually mindfulness awareness

410
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:45,600
blossoms into that greater discernment and wisdom now this is not a project it's just

411
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:52,000
something to keep in mind you can trust the process as long as awareness mindfulness is

412
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,120
practiced as part of the path it will mature

413
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,640
into discernment and wisdom

414
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:10,320
so may we all awaken into healthy relationship with the way things are

415
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:19,360
and to the capacity to show up in ways that make this life and the lives around us

416
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:23,840
better in all different kinds of ways

417
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:30,320
so thank you for your kind attention we have just um two or three minutes if

418
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:38,239
anyone here has questions that you would like to offer thank you

419
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,000
comments are also welcome

420
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:59,920
john i just want to thank you um for all your words and all the of

421
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:05,600
planning and thought that went into them but also the way you manage things this morning

422
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:13,080
that's that's a very powerful teacher so thank you thank you martha

423
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:32,880
i just want to point out how much i appreciate the difference between the stimulus to

424
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:39,920
the stress there's that space and with that space a lot of times we get caught up with the stimulus and

425
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:47,040
ruminate and not knowing the space is there and that's why mindfulness is kicking in and

426
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:52,560
knowing the space creates the expansion that's when we can have a different response

427
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,600
and so that really resonates with me so thank you thank you thank you for

428
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:04,800
putting it so well i can tell you it really went in you haven't made it thanks

429
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:09,800
anyone else we have just a moment or two

430
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:21,840
behind you i loved

431
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:26,960
uh the gatekeeper at the end that you were talking about when people show up and

432
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:34,320
what they show up with and precise perspectives and perceptions that they take with them and project

433
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:40,000
into into their environment and just it's really important to remember that

434
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:45,840
and to be aware of that you know just to let go of those that are not

435
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:51,040
beneficial and so thank you for that i love the story

436
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:55,719
thank you hillary thank you

437
