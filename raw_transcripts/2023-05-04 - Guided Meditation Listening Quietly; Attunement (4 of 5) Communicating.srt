1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,878
good morning welcome

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:14,580
so and welcome to this 7 A.M Community the YouTube meditation community and

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,240
I feel it's delightful to come together this way and the repetition of doing this for us

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:29,699
such a long time makes it feel like kind of a homecoming to sit down here and to be with you all so thank you

5
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,520
and um so one of the metaphors that is used

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,980
sometimes for meditation is listening

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,640
and in fact listening is sometimes considered to be a profound spiritual

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,000
practice especially if we listen to

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,660
what is not a sound we listen to our hearts listen to what's inside

10
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:07,680
listen to The Silence that's here many years ago someone told me that I

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,000
think it's the the Catholic order of the benedictines they're kind of a description of their way of

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,119
life begins with a Latin word esculta meaning listen

13
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,600
and the Disciples of the Buddha

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,240
were called the direct disciples who listened to him were called the

15
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,820
listeners savakas and um

16
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:46,619
but to sit in meditation and think of that we're listening the reason why it's such a useful metaphor or idea is that

17
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:53,280
with listening we have to listen well we have to suspend our judgment suspend our

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,780
commentary suspend our projections onto a situation

19
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,740
we have something has to become quiet to listen well

20
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:14,060
and if mindfulness is a kind of listening to the moment

21
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:19,200
and close your eyes it's often listening to ourselves in some deep way

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,020
why do we have to suspend to listen well what are the commentaries what's the

23
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:32,180
noise of the Mind that we quiet and willingly quiet

24
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,440
wisely quiet because we are interested in

25
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:45,720
we put Great Value in what gets revealed when we are not having commentary not

26
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,860
preoccupied in thoughts and stories past and future and to have this stance of listening

27
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,739
also we don't interfere with the sounds that come our way

28
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:06,000
I mean I guess you could go and turn up or down the volume on this broadcast if you'd like but there's something about

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,080
sounds that come that in and of themselves they come without

30
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,780
blocking the sound or attacking the sound there's something

31
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,720
about the receptivity of listening that is um

32
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,200
profound aspect of mindfulness practice

33
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:40,040
so to assume a meditation posture to assume a listening posture

34
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:49,140
I think sometimes if we go into the forest and someone points out mentions oh there's a special birds singing in

35
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:56,340
the trees it's kind of faint can you hear it and I think the the posture that we take the sometimes

36
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,680
for that is lifting the neck a little bit out of the shoulders

37
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:11,000
lifting the head up a teeny bit almost like we're becoming a better antenna to hear

38
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:21,919
pulling away from the static in the mind to be quiet

39
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,759
gently closing the eyes and adjusting your hands so

40
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:36,918
the position of the hands is the best position for the

41
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:44,360
shoulders so the shoulders have some room to relax

42
00:04:52,199 --> 00:05:00,840
and gently maybe lovingly take some deeper breaths than usual

43
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:08,659
but not so deep that it's a challenge full our breaths

44
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,419
as you breathe in feeling the Torso expand

45
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:22,979
as you exhale feeling what releases and relaxes in the

46
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:27,680
rib cage the chest and the diaphragm

47
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,220
and to then let your breathing return to normal

48
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:54,060
and continuing to feel the gentle or not so gentle expansion as you

49
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,440
breathe in and relaxing the chest as you breathe out

50
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:23,460
as you breathe in feel the global experience of being in a body

51
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,860
so you can recognize where there's some tension

52
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,800
than when you exhale soften the tension in your body

53
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:09,440
feeling any tension or pressure agitation in the thinking mind

54
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,620
as you exhale Relax The Thinking mind

55
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,460
as you exhale her gentle gentle calming

56
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,479
of the Mind

57
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:09,500
and then centering yourself on your breathing

58
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,439
maybe the metaphor of listening to your breathing

59
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:22,879
can bring an interest and a non-interference to breathing

60
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,440
receptivity and a non-judgmental however you're

61
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:39,440
breathing as if it's something to Simply listen to

62
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,560
maybe listening from deep inside the body

63
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:30,860
as you exhale letting the thinking mind become a bit quieter

64
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:41,300
so there's a higher sensitivity in the body to listen or feel

65
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:45,140
the experience of breathing

66
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,000
listening to the deep in the body where breathing begins

67
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,279
or being sensitive and quiet to hear or

68
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:48,540
feel the quiet and

69
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:56,339
soft ground or basis

70
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:02,360
through which breathing occurs

71
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,560
a quiet place underneath or behind your breathing in

72
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:23,420
listen feel sense

73
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,260
deep inside

74
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,918
foreign

75
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,480
foreign

76
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,260
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

77
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:15,500
to consider what a good skill listening is

78
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:23,299
and many people what they most want is to be listened to to be heard

79
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:34,460
in their challenges and their difficulties to be heard to be seen to be known

80
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:46,220
and may it be that this practice that we do learning to be attentive and mindful

81
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,260
can help us become better listeners to the world

82
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:02,059
better listeners to our friends and family and colleagues and Neighbors

83
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:09,299
this practice that we do leads us to be interested in others

84
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:16,880
so that we can know them better and that this is one way

85
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,419
that we extend the benefits of this practice out into the world

86
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:34,039
May our ability to listen to others bring them happiness

87
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:41,658
bring them safety bring them peace

88
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,260
bring them freedom

89
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:53,039
in this simple practical way may we bring the benefits of this

90
00:28:53,039 --> 00:29:00,360
practice into the world for the welfare and happiness of all

91
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,100
by becoming better listeners

92
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,659
thank you

93
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:15,360
so continuing on the theme of Attunement

94
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:22,380
living in a tune to the suffering of the world suffering of the people we encounter

95
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:29,580
to be attuned to our own suffering means not to Simply experience it

96
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:36,000
in the usual way your experience in ways that are challenging for us

97
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,020
but to engage in a process where being attentive to suffering is for our

98
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,840
betterment and leads the betterment of the world and one of those ways is to be attuned

99
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,419
to suffering being in harmony with it to find a balance with it

100
00:30:54,419 --> 00:31:02,159
so we're using these uh This Acronym acronym touch which seems very nice for for compassion

101
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,399
that um to be to be compassionate means to be touched by the suffering

102
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:15,179
and this idea of being touched in some deep way it's kind of tender it's kind of loving it's kind of like

103
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:21,080
we get touched by the things that are important for us that we value that that move us

104
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:26,640
and then in return to touch others

105
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,580
in uh not literally maybe but to touch others with our kindness with our support

106
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:39,000
and sometimes it can be literally sometimes a gentle touch on the shoulder or the arm

107
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:47,778
can be so meaningful for someone who feels lost broken hurt isolated

108
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:56,159
to be to touch others is to know that they're not alone so to think about the suffering we

109
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,520
encounter to find a healthy way of thinking about it to be open to it

110
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:10,860
to be upright in the presence of it and today the eight the sea is to stands

111
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:19,140
for to communicate to take time to communicate with the people that were involved in that we who

112
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:27,480
are suffering who are challenged um and one of the reasons why this is important is that it's very easy to

113
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:34,559
encounter someone who's suffering and to um assume that they're suffering the way we

114
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,840
would in a similar circumstance and we project our own experiences our own

115
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,500
history our own fears onto the other people and then we

116
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:51,539
might miss them we might not understand what's happening there what's what's really going on

117
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:56,820
so to communicate is to find out a little bit more what's happening or what's this experience like

118
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:02,399
people are suffering don't necessarily appreciate at someone appreciate probing

119
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:08,220
questions that people are really trying to you know to do probe deep into what's

120
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:14,519
going on but simple questions very open questions or statements like oh that you

121
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:20,159
know just simply they say No this must be hard is an acknowledgment and recognition of

122
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,519
what's Happening that sometimes open doors for people to feel seen and

123
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,840
recognized that they're willing to share themselves more than they volunteer how

124
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:38,940
it's how it's hard the simple question like uh you know what's

125
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:44,159
the hardest part of this what's the most difficult thing for you in this circumstance

126
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:50,039
uh it can be eye-opening to find out someone might have maybe broken their

127
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:57,240
leg and um is now kind of has to stay home and rest their leg and

128
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,340
I don't know could be immobilized for a while and they're suffering and it's difficult

129
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:08,878
and and you ask them what's the what's the most difficult thing what is it what's so hard for you or what and they

130
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:15,960
say oh the most difficult thing is that I was really accounting on going to a graduation of a dear friend of mine this

131
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,720
was a culmination of so much of their life and such an important thing and I wanted to celebrate with them and now I

132
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:27,898
can't do it and you had no idea that that was the biggest thing that they that's causing

133
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:33,358
them some distress maybe for you the idea of being

134
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,878
independent is so important that you assume that what's difficult is now they can't denote on freedom and movement and

135
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:45,599
they have to depend on others so to find out what is going on for people and hang out with them and talk

136
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,878
about what's happening and learn more deeply as don't assume we know what's

137
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:57,320
going on it's a nice question sometimes to ask is

138
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:02,700
how might I support you with this or what are some ways that you can be

139
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:09,300
supported don't even promise you're going to do it yourself but what are some of the ways you find support in this kind of

140
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,760
challenge and some people find it helpful to be reminded with a question like that then

141
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,920
they think oh yes I forgot meditation is important for Me Maybe

142
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:28,140
This is a time to meditate or friends are important for me and um or you know whatever it might be

143
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:34,260
and um asking very simple questions or acknowledging what's happening with

144
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:40,020
someone is a active expression of compassion of caring for someone

145
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:47,400
and some people that's what they mostly need they don't necessarily need someone to fix them or do things with them but

146
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:53,640
just kind of sit with them and recognize oh that's what's happening I've been with people and I've been

147
00:35:53,640 --> 00:36:00,420
challenged by something who were really quick to want to do things and like let's go and do this and

148
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:07,079
that and that'll be make it all better and I just simply wanted to be quiet and be present and be with what's going on

149
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:15,060
and I would have valued having a friend who sat and just be we gently quietly talked about it and I could just ex you

150
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:23,700
know in the voice and my feelings and thoughts that I have so this ability to listen deeply

151
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,920
and listen in such a way and communicate in such a way that we're not trying to

152
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,859
fix people we're not trying to be the helper first and foremost we're trying

153
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:41,579
to be the person who uh understands to sees gets to know the

154
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:48,599
suffering we have in the world and um and the more we can be directly with

155
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:55,020
people to find out the deeper we understand what the suffering is if we read about suffering in the news

156
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:01,619
that's far away the other side of the world we can certainly have compassion for that we can certainly feel the pain of

157
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:07,260
that in some ways but the chances are that we're projecting a tremendous amount of our

158
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:15,000
own assumptions onto that situation so our imagination has come alive and some of the imagination might be

159
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,900
true enough but it's very different that we're on the ground being with people and seeing exactly the details of what's

160
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:28,740
Happening and um so this is enough communicating and seeing and learning more so when the

161
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:35,760
suffering is Far Away really take the time to read study look more deeply into

162
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,520
the situation get it so deeply that you have sometimes um a sense of what it's like for

163
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,220
individuals in that circumstance and because now with the with all kinds of

164
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:52,980
social media with news with the videos that's happening so easily often you can

165
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:59,579
see people being interviewed or people who are talking and saying how it is so that there's a deeper connection to

166
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:06,420
people to what's actually happening for them so finding ways to communicate finding

167
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:14,400
ways to listen finding a ways to speak speak that are open-ended that are caring that are that

168
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:21,900
are not and in rush to fix and to help and also be very careful learning

169
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:27,960
how to communicate that in our communication you know talking with people who are suffering we're not first

170
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:34,079
and foremost taking care of ourselves or or moving the attention of the

171
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:40,440
conversation to ourselves and you know a classic way of doing that it's a is to say something like oh I

172
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,660
know exactly what you're feeling I went through the same thing and then we start telling the story of what we went

173
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:51,119
through and maybe it's not the same thing we don't know actually what's going on with others

174
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,280
and it's a way of disconnecting an extreme version and disconnecting and

175
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:02,579
now the conversation is more about oneself and about the person we're with so when people the more people are

176
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:08,760
suffering you want to be very careful how much you talk about yourself and uh and sometimes talking about

177
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,420
myself is a way of caring for ourselves or trying to kind of assuage or calm down our our own

178
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:20,579
discomfort we have what's going on sometimes talking fast talking a lot

179
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:27,300
asking a lot of questions rushing to Solutions is more about taking care of

180
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:34,760
our own discomfort than is really taking care of the other person that we haven't learned to get to get to know yet

181
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:40,200
so communication is such an important and profound phenomena

182
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,420
that sometimes I think of the word sacred communication

183
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:52,020
that somehow the um when we when we communicate from the place of practice

184
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:58,980
from the depths of Who We Are then the communication goes better

185
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:04,500
and this is why something like meditation where we've learned to listen deeply to

186
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:10,920
ourselves can show us a place inside from which we

187
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,680
can listen to others with some depth and maybe even for some people in our

188
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:23,099
listening in our communication there our depths can touch their depths

189
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:29,579
and so that it's really something profound that goes on between two people

190
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:34,680
I've been in situations of being challenged some suffering in my life

191
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:41,700
and had conversations with other practitioners that turned out to not really be about particular suffering

192
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:47,339
where have I was having but somehow we dropped into some deeper place of where

193
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:54,000
we find the most value and importance in the practice and that being reminded being touching

194
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,400
into that that was like the best medicine for me in this situation that I

195
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,440
had and from that I had the resources and the ability to be open to be upright

196
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:11,700
to be present for the challenges I had foreign so communicate

197
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:16,920
um so think about be open

198
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,880
be upright communicate and then tomorrow I'll talk about help

199
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,980
the last uh part of the acronym touch

200
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:34,140
and um so what's important here is that the

201
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:40,200
helping comes after the first four so that rather than thinking we have to

202
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,200
help first and foremost first and foremost we want to prepare ourselves to be ready to help

203
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,960
and and thinking openness uprightness and

204
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,540
communication prepares the ground for effective ways of being support of

205
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:04,760
serving other people so that's for tomorrow thank you
