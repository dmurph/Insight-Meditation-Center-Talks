1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,840
that topic for this talk is

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,760
grief and maybe the talk can be titled liberating grief

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,000
and what motivates this talk is in big part is that the one-year anniversary

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,279
of many of us going into sheltering in place

5
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:39,360
and the dramatic way in which our whole world has much of the world as 99 of it has been

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,800
turned upside down or inside out or radically changed by the pandemic

7
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:53,920
and in marking this one-year anniversary it feels important to acknowledge and

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:02,559
make room for and bring forth the grief that has been part of this year

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,560
and that grief is not something that should be shied away from

10
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,040
or be embarrassed about but it's actually a very important part of human beings and our

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:23,600
human life and and it should be acknowledged it should be under understood and seen and

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:31,439
and what's uh significant i think for many of us recognize is that the griefs of the last year have been

13
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,159
wide-ranging certainly there are some of them are huge i mean

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,640
many around the world millions of people have died in the united states well over 500 000 people have died

15
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,360
directly from the disease and the illness and then there's been many who have been seriously sick

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,840
and some with with the long-termers like long-haul people people who their symptoms that continue

17
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,880
for months and months and maybe it'll be for years and so there's a grief of the loss of so

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,920
many things loss of people loss also family members friends

19
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,000
from death then sickness and then there's the grief of just loss of connections of people we've been

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,400
regularly connected to are sheltering in place themselves and there's not much communication

21
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,560
and the grief of not being social in the same way we were

22
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,080
before there's all these small griefs that goes along

23
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,519
that we experience of all the things we can't do or that we're used to doing and

24
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,599
that we value doing and all the small ways in which we've gotten energized and inspired about life and

25
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,440
ready to go out and do it are not available and some people find there's a slow slow steady

26
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:58,560
attrition of energy of inspiration of motivation partly from the slow kind of drip by

27
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,959
dripping of little griefs and sorrows and sadness as that go on

28
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,200
and then there's uh the things that happen in our society the challenges the griefs the sorrow the

29
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:19,840
sadness about politics and about racial injustice and economic injustice and

30
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,760
nowadays you know we were aware of medical injustice and environmental injustice

31
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,000
and um and you know and violence and hatred

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,640
the violence against asian americans is you know is heartbreaking the violence

33
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:46,640
against black americans is heartbreaking and and the hatred that exists in our

34
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,799
society that people go around shooting each other so all these things together

35
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,120
you know are forms of sadness and grief and and that kind of accumulate can

36
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,080
accumulate if they're not acknowledged and not known and not liberated

37
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,959
so there's three ways of being with grief there's accompanying grief

38
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,239
there is no in grief and there's liberating grief

39
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,440
and what i like about these words accompanying knowing and liberating that

40
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,560
grammatically they can both be a verb and an adjective

41
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,479
so knowing accompanying grief means we are the companions of it we bring

42
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,759
ourselves and be present for it and ex be with it but it also

43
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,280
it's the grief that does the accompanying it's a grief accompanying grief can also

44
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,040
be the grief that accompanies us and it's a mutual relationship

45
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,560
you and your grief and to feel and experience that mutuality is really

46
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,440
really to allow the accompanying to be full there is a knowing grief where we can

47
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,440
know it but there's also the grief that knows something

48
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,880
grief is not just ignorant or dumb or you know uninformed

49
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:24,400
grief is something that's really well informed about something very important and what is it that grief knows and

50
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,880
so when we know grief we're also learning what does grief know and then uh

51
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,440
liberating grief is both you know we can liberate the grief perhaps but also there's the idea that there's a

52
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,960
grief that is liberating and and how can you know something as

53
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,639
painful and difficult as grief can be at times how can that be liberating as well and

54
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,840
and to even to say those words or suggest that idea can feel like a

55
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,280
betrayal or to the grief we have or could feel like a insult to the

56
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:07,919
degree of pain we can experience the grief so grief uh such an important topic

57
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:15,360
for us and i had this in my in mind that we could uh somehow

58
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,960
do this talk together that not just me talking but maybe those

59
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:29,520
of you have access to the chat we can have a little bit to do this as in teamwork

60
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:37,039
they um so accompanying grief

61
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,240
grief is an ordinary part of human beings lives there's it's to be expected it will have

62
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,440
grief it's not a mistake to have grief if we're living and paying attention and

63
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,639
caring about life and caring about things there'll be grief there'll be sorrow there'll be sadness

64
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,080
and and so to spend time with that and allow ourselves to feel it to trust it

65
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,280
to be with it and people who do mindfulness practices can

66
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:14,400
really maybe appreciate this how valuable it is to be with something be all this partly because we start feeling

67
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,960
that um to not be with it is to not be with ourselves that as we

68
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,520
learn to be really present for our experience present in ourselves and being opening up to all of who we

69
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,520
are there's a feeling of coming home to ourselves or feeling whole in ourselves

70
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:40,319
uh complete in ourselves or no part left out and it's uh in doing so we become a

71
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,479
refuge to ourselves we become a refuge a place of um

72
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,400
of support a place of freedom a place of being we're allowed to be full and complete

73
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,440
and as soon as we have something like grief that's too painful for us or too embarrassing for us or to

74
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,639
something we want to push away or ignore or repress then

75
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:11,360
we are dividing ourselves we're no longer whole we're no longer able to come back into our hearts and

76
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,120
feel at home there and so to and to accompany ourselves

77
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,479
accompany the grief is a means to kind of learn to stay whole learn to stay

78
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:32,560
complete or learn to be a refuge to ourselves no matter how big and strong the pain is

79
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,839
there's good reason why people want to avoid grief and that is because it can be painful

80
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,360
acute grief you know is searing is you know it's just like everything is torn apart

81
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,440
and and um you know the kind of the world the fabric of the world is torn apart

82
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,839
and it can be excruciating to feel some griefs so it's very painful and so the idea of

83
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:04,000
accompanying grief is to accompany our pain and if we don't do that then

84
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,399
the grief and the pain remains but maybe it goes underground it gets repressed or gets kind of

85
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,519
ignored and but it still operates it's still there

86
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,360
festering and uh and it's there if it hasn't really been dealt with

87
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,560
fully or with dignity or nobility then

88
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,040
it can come back and come back in unexpected and maybe un healthy ways in terms of anger or

89
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,200
excessive fear or or being too closed and numb from what's

90
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,480
going on so to accompany all this is to accompany

91
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:52,399
the ways we go numb to company also the ways we get angry the ways we get feel helpless and hopeless to just

92
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,399
accompany ourselves in the pain so i did that this last week to some

93
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,600
degree for me personally it was a very touching experience

94
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:12,240
time for me where i moved my mother into a memory care home

95
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,320
and and i think the most poignant part of it was

96
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,720
walking across the parking lot of um of the you know the memory care

97
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,000
place to bring her to the door and because of covid like can't come in someone comes out

98
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,240
and receives her and any companies are in where i stay behind so here i was

99
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,480
walking across the parking lot very acutely aware of

100
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,920
what was painful for me over 60 years ago and that was one of the earliest memories i have of

101
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,360
my mother was her accompanying me when i was about four years old

102
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:00,720
across a school playground i was holding her hand and i was crying

103
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,519
because i was going to the first day of school in a foreign country in a language i didn't speak in geneva where they spoke

104
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,360
french and i didn't speak french and then going to a catholic

105
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:20,160
best my memory kindergarten maybe something like that that

106
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:27,120
was run by nuns and i was uh so i was just she was walking me across i was holding my hand i was crying

107
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,760
and now over 60 years later you know the roles were reversed and

108
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:42,079
and her memory was not such that she quite understood what was going on but i did and so that came back

109
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:48,079
and i'm a comp i made space for it and then after i took her there i went for a long walk in the hills

110
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:54,320
around here just to accompany my grief accompany my sadness of what was going on

111
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,800
and it was kind of kind of the richness of it partly was the leftover of a certain pain it's the

112
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,959
memory of the pain from over 60 years ago that speaks to a principle that

113
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:13,600
that uh sometimes our griefs are previous griefs

114
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,480
and even more so if the griefs are unresolved or un somehow have been pushed down or ignored um

115
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,839
they get reawakened with new griefs and so the new griefs can be much more

116
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:32,399
acute because of the how it can be with um with um

117
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:39,680
you know that uh with the red legacy of griefs that we've had so to accompany grief is to accompany

118
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,600
pain and and for people who do mindfulness practice we begin discovering

119
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,120
that there's a difference between pain and suffering and this makes a world of difference and

120
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,240
this is really what the heart of buddhist practice is about is to if we can see that difference

121
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:05,760
then we can maybe learn to let go of the suffering and then learn to with nobility with

122
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,040
with the compassion uh accompany the pain that's part of human

123
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,800
life the suffering is when we contract around the pain

124
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:24,079
when we close the heart around the pain when we cover over the pain when we resist the pain

125
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:30,000
when we are afraid of the pain all these other ways that we contract and get wrapped up in

126
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,079
in it is the suffering but the pain doesn't you know and that's

127
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:43,279
what we're liberating in in buddhist practice all that kind of complicated reactivity to the pain

128
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,839
and it's uh but just to live with the pain and make space for it be open to it

129
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,040
be a refuge for the pain help the pain feel safe

130
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,880
safe in us and to learn that art to learn that ability to accompany our pain

131
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:08,880
so it begins by you know recognizing what the pain is naming it so that we can see what

132
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,959
what's been going on and what's been happening and and so for this pandemic in marking this

133
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:21,279
anniversary there's been big big griefs

134
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,560
big things to grieve and small things to grieves and all these teeny incidental things that

135
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,600
some people say would shouldn't count you know i should be not up to handling that and dealing with that but the accumulation

136
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,120
of all these small little things and that have been challenging and losses over this year

137
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,720
they add up to a lot and one of the lessons of grief is never discount any grief never feel

138
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,160
that because other people's grief is so much bigger mind shouldn't count

139
00:14:52,160 --> 00:15:00,000
every grief counts every grief is something to accompany to know and to liberate because if we don't

140
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,320
do that then slowly incrementally we begin closing down or pushing under

141
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:14,079
and and the vitality the fullness of being here you know is going to be diminished so if

142
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:20,160
you're willing maybe if you could write some of you would be willing to write in the chat

143
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,800
maybe one or two or three words or whatever you want

144
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:31,920
of what you have grieved this last year that has to do with this pandemic and uh

145
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,160
it'd be nice to have some names associated not um not necessarily to people but you know

146
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,600
that to these different kinds of griefs named here

147
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:55,839
and um so what have we what have you grieved over this last year

161
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:36,320
yeah these these loss of pets can be huge huge grief loss of closest friend also

162
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:44,960
not being in sangha with distant relatives i think moments even of freedom from

163
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,520
fear not attending to a dear friend's father's funeral

164

166
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:11,440

167
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,400
music jams lost my ability to understand my loved

168
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,720
ones changing friendships

169
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:30,559
so thank you all for writing all those things it's a big deal so these are the things to accompany

170
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,880
these are things to name and to be with and and sometimes it's helpful to have help

171
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,360
support and accompaniment that's what sometimes having friends you can talk to about the griefs we have

172
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,760
and not to fix not to solve but just to help to to heaven to be a have a

173
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:57,919
companionship in the grief and some griefs are so difficult to be our own companion to that having

174
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,480
someone else who can support us in that process there are like grief counselors for example and they're

175
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,080
useful in many ways but one way is that they know how to be companions in a

176
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:17,280
company and be present for and so it's easier for us to then to be our own companions for our

177
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:25,280
grief because we have someone who really knows how to do it and can do it with care and compassion and acceptance

178
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:32,640
and and then learning how to be willing learning how to be comfortable

179
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:39,840
if that's the right word with feeling pain learning how to be open to feeling pain

180
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,840
learning the wisdom of being with pain the more we love something that we've

181
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,880
lost more we love something that we lost that love doesn't go away and that

182
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,799
something is precious if we what is is to really really kind of listen

183
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:06,880
deeply get to know deeply what's going on here and that's the second step of this three-step process knowing

184
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:14,159
grief really getting to know what is this grief what is this pain being willing to really attend to it

185
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,720
because there's a tendency sometimes when we're in really some situation we're in a lot of pain

186
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,520
and hurt and feeling of betrayal to get angry and push things away and

187
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:35,840
and be hostile or something and which is natural enough it's a way of avoiding sometimes the pain

188
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,840
but to uh but to really get to know the pain because the way to which we love

189
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,760
something to that degree our capacity our beautiful capacity for love our beautiful capacity for

190
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,120
something good is is there buried in the pain

191
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:59,760
is found together with the pain pain isn't all necessarily all bad

192
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,440
and so to really get to know grief and no pain to know that part of the grief that kind

193
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,799
of that suffering as opposed to pain to be able to make that distinction

194
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:17,440
between the contractions we have and the resistance the shoulds and the shouldn'ts i shouldn't be feeling grief i should be

195
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,200
over it by now i'm supposed to go through grief perfectly and supposed to resolve my

196
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,039
grief i'm supposed to heal my grief i don't know if we're supposed to heal grief or

197
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:36,240
some people heal grief but i don't know if we're supposed to or acquired always or we're supposed to resolve grief some

198
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,000
of us never healed in the sense that the pain never goes away but

199
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,760
we can make more space for it it's part of our deep humanity to feel the pain of living life freedom real

200
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,799
freedom it can coexist with pain freedom does not coexist with suffering

201
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,880
suffering is the loss of freedom and so to make to just

202
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,600
keep opening the heart and allow it to be broken allow it to have space for the

203
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,200
pain that we feel um is part of it and sometimes grief can

204
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,960
be so strong that any words about it like the words i'm doing today

205
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,159
can feel just impossible and too difficult to listen to and it doesn't

206
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:33,039
make any sense occasionally grief has to go we have to reach rock bottom for something to finally

207
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:41,280
give out or it just seems like so impossible and so to really company really know how impossible it is

208
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:48,799
and stay there with it stay there with it is part of at least what this mindfulness practice teaches

209
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,679
the um to be with pain to be with it all

210
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:03,440
and now just remembering some of the things that i was thinking about we grieve i've grieved

211
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,919
in my my life i've grieved anticipated futures the future and now

212
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:17,200
that won't happen because my friend died we grieve what happened in the past we

213
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,960
grieve what didn't happen in the past what should have happened in the past so

214
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,000
all these you know layers and layers of grief that we can feel

215
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,240
so this knowing grief in vipassana practice has a lot to do with the direct

216
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:41,760
experience in the moment which is to feel it in your body how is what is the manifestation of grief here

217
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,960
and now in the body what parts of the body are touched and moved and

218
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,279
ache with grief and we can find identify how it is physically here and now

219
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:59,520
then that becomes a place the very location where we begin opening up to it where we

220
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,480
open the heart we open the mind we open attention and make make see how big the awareness could be

221
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,520
so we can hold that place and be with it if it's not located sometimes in the

222
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,200
body it just seems like it's just overwhelming but sometimes we're located in the body

223
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,840
it has a kind of a locus it has a kind of location to be close with or intimate with or to touch or

224
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:30,640
to connect to so maybe here on the chat again would some

225
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,240
of you be willing to write where how and where in the body

226
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:47,840
do you experience grief some of the locations and places for that

227
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,760
there are wonderful bodies that carry so much i have difficulty

228
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:12,559
swallowing stomach and chest digestion mostly in

229
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:19,520

235
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:02,880

236
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:10,640
jaw tightens shoulders so thank you for all that headache from

237
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:20,000
angry thoughts brain core of my being center of my body

238
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:30,158
water flowing out yeah lots of tears

239
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,600
headache lower back

240
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:45,120
in the voice yeah so so many ways it manifests in the

241
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,440
body darkness in the head and the entire being so these are the places that we bring

242
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,120
our compassion and care these are the places we hold these are places where you want to bring a sense

243
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,760
of safety to in the pit of my stomach to mindfulness is to bring a sense of

244
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:10,080
safety to these places in the body that ache and hurt and are contracted and tight

245
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,679
and there's a way in which to trust that to trust feeling it and sensing it and being with

246
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,799
it it can be very very hard one of the things that makes grief

247
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:26,559
particularly difficult is when they're it when we feel helpless or hopeless

248
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:32,720
with their grief and and the sense of helplessness is a we

249
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,559
can for some people especially if it's chronic is really debilitating and the ability

250
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,679
to accompany and to know and to feel and connect and

251
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,720
and to make space for and to hold in the body is a way that over starts

252
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:58,640
overcoming this feeling of helplessness we can help ourselves there is hope for ourselves through this

253
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:05,120
practice of mindfulness we have something we can do we have we can't we might be helpless in

254
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:12,080
terms of for for those who are dead or gone or losses we have for them to come back

255
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:20,799
but it doesn't leave us as a helpless person we can engage with agency with sense of purpose

256
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:28,960
and it's a profound thing very profound to learn the ability to hold our pain

257
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,360
and not to add layers of suffering on top of it there's no shame in adding suffering on

258
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:42,000
top of our pain because sometimes what we need to accompany what we need to open to

259
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,960
is a clear exp seeing knowing and experiencing of those layers of reactivity we have

260
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,120
and without that we don't have a hope of really experiencing what charlie brown called i

261
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,880
think he called we had good grief good grief is the grief that

262
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,919
is simple is unentangled we don't have all these layers of

263
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,360
shoulds and shouldn'ts on top of it it should be different we should be over it right now or

264
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:18,480
i don't deserve to be grieving because other people's grief so much more all these things we do

265
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,440
and then finally there's liberating grief and and this is kind of what i'm saying

266
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,039
all along is liberating the grief not from getting rid of the grief

267
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:37,279
not from not no longer having grief but liberating it from how the grief

268
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:44,000
all the suffering on top of the grief all the reactivity all the judgments all the

269
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,320
angers all the pushing away the resistance all the ways in which we divide

270
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:57,200
ourselves by shutting out part of who we are because it's too painful to be with

271
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,960
uh to liberate is to become whole liberate is no part left out all of who

272
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,039
we are is allowed to be there not because we are justifying or

273
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:16,960
celebrating it or condoning it necessarily but so that we can open up and

274
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,440
and have it all be part of the whole the whole is always greater than the

275
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,440
parts and grief is one of the parts they can feel like it's the whole thing

276
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:36,159
when it's really intense but it's always par a piece of a part of the whole and to

277
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:44,480
make room for it and to hold it and be with it it might mean that the liberated person

278
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:51,760
might cry because the pure simplicity of the pain brings along

279
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,919
tears tears are not a sign of being unliberated they might be a sign of actually

280
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:03,360
we're beginning to liberate ourselves that's where the liberation happens

281
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:09,760
i love the idea i love the part they have the ways in which it's possible to cry in meditation

282
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,919
because there's something about the meditation posture where we it's a posture in which we

283
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,960
never collapse we never sink we never

284
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,200
give up we never succumb to it but we stay simple relaxed up if you're

285
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,640
upright upright and let the tears flow

286
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,559
so there's not the self-pity or the giving up or something and there's freedom and just crying

287
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:46,960
there's freedom there's liberation found in that sometimes so um liberating our grief

288
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,039
without needing it to go away so that we can go through our life

289
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:59,919
continuing to experience the griefs that will come there's no there's no final freedom from

290
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:06,640
grief and sadness but to go through life and be free in the midst of it is to allow

291
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,320
ourselves to feel it the vitality the fullness of life with the grief and with the joys and

292
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,360
with the love and with all that's here

293
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:24,880
and this is not resolving grief in terms of it going away it's not finally it's over

294
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:31,919
it's it's the grief has its own life and so liberating our grief

295
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:39,200
is to be generous to our grief so the grief can have its freedom the

296
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,519
grief can do what it needs to do and to learn to trust the heart knows what to do the heart knows what to do

297
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:51,679
with grief if we've liberated it if we if we know it accompany it and we get out of its

298
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,799
way and we've liver liberated from ourselves our hearts our grief

299
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:06,000
knows what to do and sometimes we have to be patient it takes time so liberating our grief

300
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,519
so some of you maybe have had some experience of grief liberated in the way

301
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:18,799
i've described talk about here and how does it feel how do you know that leaf has grief has

302
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:24,399
been liberated how do you know uh how that experienced in you how's

303
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:29,919
experience in your body what's it like to have grief maybe even still present

304
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:38,559
but really feel it's been liberated so um let's see

305
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:47,518
here there can be a purity to the feeling of grief and strong emotion maybe that's part of the liberation yes

306
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,840
and um

307
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,480
part of what it feels like for me is a willingness

308
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,760
the liberation of grief comes along with a willingness a willingness to grieve a willingness to

309
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,240
have pain

310
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,679
breaking away and lifting of weight i feel like i'm cared and safe

311
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:29,919
when i let it go i felt more here and connected to others compassion sense

312
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,280
and grief emerging sense of peace feeling joy along with the sorrow

313
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:42,158
getting in touch with the raw emotion and being with it forgiveness there is truth in the deep

314
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,760
sorrow and grief lifted weight of grief more love and

315
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,560
accompanying grief relaxation and gratitude i feel lighter it feels cleansing forgiveness

316
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,000
more peace and openness acceptance of experience at peace with

317
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,839
it putting down a large rock grief from childhood became compassion

318
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:11,200
for my parents heart opens and i cry more with the connection

319
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:19,040
grief is a necessary part of moving on from the loss feeling the joy right next to it

320
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:25,440
great thank you for all this very much feeling the love behind an inside of

321
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:32,400
grief and feeling grateful for such love if you feel like i'm moving again

322
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,320
relief the heart knows what to do with grief when it has been liberated

323
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,960
i will always carry this incredibly wise statement thank you oh it's a quote quoting so

324
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,920
um thank you so accompanying our grief

325
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:59,040
knowing our knowing grief and liberating grief uh three different ways of being with

326
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:05,760
grief at different times different ones one of them are appropriate and

327
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,920
it's a profound part of our human life and it's been an important part and importance the right

328
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:19,359
word a very significant part of this last year and and as we begin the second year

329
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:26,800
of kovid with whatever changes might be coming that um that uh to acknowledge

330
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,200
a little bit what happened this last year and to have spent time really accompanying

331
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:40,240
knowing and liberating this grief hopefully will let us go into this new world this new year

332
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:47,440
more capable more willing more wise and how to continue to meet

333
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,920
the griefs that will come one way or the other will still have griefs whether even when the pandemic's over

334
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,359
we'll have griefs this is part of human life and there's no liberation

335
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:05,839
without being liberated in relationship to our grief as well we are grieving beings just as much as

336
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:11,040
we're loving beings compassionate beings forgiving beings

337
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:20,560
we're also beings that can experience pain so thank you very much for this

338
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:28,480
and i'm aware that grief is a huge well abyss of pain sometimes very

339
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,400
difficult and bringing it up today and evoking it this way might be very hard for some of you

340
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,839
and i encourage you to spend some time um today caring for yourself if that's the

341
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:45,040
case maybe talk to friends go for walks

342
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,720
if you have no one to talk to journal about it write about it so it's so you can you

343
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,839
give it some expression and but do take care of yourself and and

344
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:02,400
um and uh if this talk was particularly difficult um maybe in a few days listen to it

345
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,400
again there might be some something moving and bubbling inside of you from it

346
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,760
but i wish you well and i offer you this talk with a lot of

347
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:20,240
desire and care and compassion for your welfare and happiness and and for all of us as we go forward

348
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,359
together in this new next year that may all of us

349
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:33,838
support each other in this process thank you all very much
