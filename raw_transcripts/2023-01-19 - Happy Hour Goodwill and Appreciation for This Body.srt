um meta for the body metaphor the body can be quite a powerful

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:47,100
practice engaging with meta Good Will appreciation kindness

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,440
um for for this body that we call ours and yet

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,719
it's not exactly ours it's made up of so

10
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,739
many causes and conditions um but have made it so and we can't it's

11
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:12,900
not exactly ours and what I mean by that is that we don't completely have control over it we can't say okay stop digesting

12
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,159
now or or heal faster or or don't get sick or or whatever it is you

13
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:28,619
know we have limited control over this body there's some you know yeah we take care of it we we hopefully appreciate it

14
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:34,799
we tend to it and yet um it's above and beyond we take it to

15
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,939
be ours and yet it's above and beyond so um might be helpful sometimes with in

16
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:49,439
our meditation as I perhaps will will guide and suggest tonight is to see this

17
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,659
body this hard-working amazing miraculous body that breathes and

18
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,720
digests and hails itself when we get a paper cut we wouldn't know how to do it

19
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:09,060
um but um we consider it perhaps sometimes as a

20
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,360
not just as a friend as a friend maybe sometimes having a hard time it's doing

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,720
they're doing their best and they're having a hard time they're having challenges perhaps

22
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,239
um it also has the Beloved other as a beloved other I'll I'll say more about

23
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,580
that through the uh meditation so

24
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,879

receiving being seen known

57
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,959
sort of mud liking [Music] its size or function or this or that

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,759
not a one-to-one mapping at all

71
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,480

144
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:43,980
sharing our Goodwill not just for this body this

145
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:49,919

146
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:59,099

149
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,760
thank you for your practice

150
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:42,900
so what we did tonight was turning our appreciation our love

151
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:49,740
our meta towards the body really appreciating not taking for granted the various functions of course there's so

152
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:56,280
many many more functions and um and that as a way of appreciating

153
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:03,780
because sometimes again we have this attitude about the body when it's challenged or it's aging or sagging in

154
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:10,980
the way of ugh not liking it or just or hating it or it's as if it's letting us down this

155
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:17,820
body as if it's personal but what did we completely turned that around into appreciation into just love and

156
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:23,579
appreciation for all these amazing functions or what actually works what has been

157
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:29,099
working profound instead of turning into what's not working and what is a challenge and

158
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:35,359
what's the problem and this sense of appreciation love

159
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:42,240
gratitude meta for the body is a so way in there's a way in for meta for

160
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:48,000
ourselves which which many folks find it difficult having good will for ourselves

161
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,940
but we start with the body kind of it's like a side door we enter through the side door because maybe it's easier to

162
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:59,160
have appreciation for our eyes oh yeah I can see yeah maybe I need glasses now

163
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:05,700
but yeah it still works pretty amazing then as a doorway from mental for

164
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,099
herself so so

165
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:17,280
changing the settings in the chat if you have any Reflections that you'd like to

166
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,440
share you can type to in chat to everyone or it's private you can just

174
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:26,579
I wanted to share because this is a topic that's been very important in my life I have two family members who were

175
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:32,280
severely disabled in accidents through no fault of their own and have managed

176
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:38,339
to not only survive but live very happy productive lives but they taught me to

177
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:44,400
always be grateful for what I have um because I am I still ride a bike and

178
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,099
I'm not young by any stretch um and I'm still an active cyclist uh

179
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:55,200
and I'm so grateful that I have been given this wonderful body that works

180
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,079
very well for me uh but I work hard at taking good care of it also so I liked

181
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:06,540
your topic very much because it rang very close to things that are important

182

184
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,160
in their function but they have they have been living very full lives yeah

185

00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:45,500
small groups

188
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:54,599
Neil says it's better thanks for asking wait that's probably

189
00:39:54,599 --> 00:40:01,880
was that for me that might have been for someone else whoops okay no problem

190
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:10,140
oh no that was a direct message also never mind it was in public [Laughter]

191
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:18,078
I hope you're a bit I'm glad it's better Neil whatever it is is better okay you're raising your hand now

192
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,260
yeah I really enjoyed this meditation someone asked me I had a bad headache last night I missed class so they asked me how I

193
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:35,940
was doing um yeah it was just you know it the concept that you know whatever's not

194
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:41,040
working well you know is really doing its best anyhow

195
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,400
um you know even at it feeling miserable you know I've been having a lot of back problems in the past I don't know like

196
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:54,240
too long um you know but thinking thinking oh I hate my back is really just so terrible

197
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,520
right it just right and you know this thought of thinking gee you know my

198
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,760
back's doing its best I you know you know I wish I could do better it wishes it could do better do what could I do to

199
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:12,560
help it you know it just makes life you know so much you know more pleasant

200
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,660
so right right and this you know I've had thoughts like that and this meditation seemed to really Foster those

201
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:24,300
it was it was really quite lovely beautiful thank you so much Leo well

202
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:29,940
well said it's yeah exactly I could couldn't say it better yeah

203
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:39,740
um thank you and I'm glad your headache is better yes of course yeah yeah it's great yeah

204
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:47,060
um one of you asks how to offer a meta to those we hate um foreign

205
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:58,200
[Music] it goes through concentric circles so you start with with someone that's easy

206
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:04,380
for you to have metaphor and then yourself if that's

207
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:13,859
more challenging so someone that was easy than yourself then someone who um is neutral

208
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:21,839
someone you don't either like or dislike you know very little about um maybe someone you know Barista at a

209
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:27,119
coffee shop Etc and then after you do the neutral category then that becomes

210
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:35,040
the stand-in that it becomes easier than to move to people you dislike because

211
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,920
um it's kind of a gradual so you can't kind of just jump into doing meta for

212
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:48,240
those users so so I suggested the person who asked that question do a little more gradual uh cultivation and they're

213
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:54,000
actually a recorded guided meditations on Audio Dharma that's not the theme

214
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,640
tonight for offering method to those who are challenging we don't say those we

215
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:06,140
hate but those we have challenges with um so please look uh on at

216
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:13,440
audiodarma.org and search under um meta for for those we have challenges

217
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,460
with and you will find many guided meditations that will support you

218
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:28,619
um another person asks how is meta for the body related to reflection on repulsiveness of the body ah

219
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:36,200
I'll say very briefly so um there are practices of uh asuba in Pali

220
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:42,599
so it's translated as repulsiveness but that's not a very helpful translation

221
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:48,000
actually um it's kind of it's the not

222
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,900
attractiveness not because we often you know look at the body or body of others usually it's like oh it's attractive and

223
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:02,339
there's Sexual Energy and especially when it's inappropriate so that practice really is a way for us to to bring

224
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:09,720
wisdom that oh it's just the body it's just oh yeah it's just functional it's just a functional body you know that leg

225
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:15,000
that oh yeah what a beautiful it's just a functional body is just walking

226
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:23,099
um and then there is more to it when you actually start to see if there's again more desire and and more if there's a

227
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:30,780
lot of Desire then you start to see that oh yeah it's you know the leg is made of of skin and sinews and Flesh and Blood

228
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:36,420
you start to see it as its functionality in order to actually see to kind of cure

229
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,940
yourself of this infatuation you might be having with with someone's body so

230
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:48,720
it's a very Wholesome Way it's not just so that you start hating your body or other people's body it's a very skillful

231
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:54,300
very clever actually set of practices which I have practiced actually

232
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:59,880
um and offering method to the bodies is a sense of appreciation for the

233
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:07,020
functionality it's it's again it's not falling in love with its beauty it's not that so actually these two practices go

234
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:12,720
together quite well and I can say a lot more I can lecture

235
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:19,200
on this for hours but time is limited and the time actually has come for us to to transition to small groups the person

236
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,359
who asked that question I hope that clarified it for you a little bit

237
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:30,900
and it was helpful so so you're welcome

238
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:36,839
um so yeah I'd like to invite us to engage in um

239
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:42,780
raise small groups with with uh fellow practitioners and something actually I

240
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:48,060
uh is listening to um this this interview

241
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:56,460
um uh it was on NPR about this yeah was the about the um Harvard uh adult study

242
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:03,560
that has gone on since 1930 so it's almost like 90 years anyway and some the

243
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:10,560
scientists scientists have written a new book about what is the biggest measure

244
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:17,420
of of of health or healthy happy life and it turns out to be surprise surprise

245
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:23,819
relationships relationships so here in happy hour we have the opportunity for

246
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:29,339
relationships in this next section to just relate to have a conversation uh

247
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:36,660
with another a couple of fellow practitioners in the space so I encourage you to engage

248
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:42,200
and um the uh the

249
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:47,280
reflection for the the small groups tonight is

250
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,440
um is about the relationship to the body how

251
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:59,160
can we you know how can you how how do you how can you how do you aspire to to

252
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:05,160
have a a metaphilled relationship especially with a part of your body that

253
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:11,819
might be challenged that might be challenged how can you love and support it instead of hating it and disliking it

254
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:18,440
and pushing it Etc as Neil beautifully said it is doing its best

255
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:25,440
so as always invited to maybe share a reflection and then

256
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,780
um uh maybe you also hold space maybe when the

257
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:36,119
your turn comes you say pass and then the next person says something and then the next person says something and then

258
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:41,520
it comes your turn so each nugget let it be short so that there's time and space

259
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,859
for everyone to share something um then again if your turn comes you can

260
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:52,440
say pass and um and the next time comes to you maybe

261
00:47:52,440 --> 00:48:01,740
there's something you want to share so so with that be kind to yourself

262
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:07,920
um be yeah be kind to yourself be kind to yourself be kind to each other all

263
