1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:09,399
good morning um is it sound good is everyone can hear great thank

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,920
you so um I'm going to uh begin with um

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:31,960
a little story about a a one of the monks at asham brahs Monastery and um Asam Rah is um the

4
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:38,520
Abbot of uh a monastery in Western Australia that's kind of remote and um

5
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,200
so it's not very easy to get you know back and forth to town and and when people need to see the doctor it's like

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,719
quite a quite a track and you know monks don't drive so it's always not so

7
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:58,440
convenient and um one of the monks was having um a lot of dental problems and

8
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,518
um you know he'd gone back there ones to the dentist and you know and again the problem a different problem started and

9
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,920
um you know so you know a Bram was walking around and at the monastery and

10
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:18,040
he sees that that monk uh standing by the Woodshed with um uh pliers and

11
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:25,720
bloody tooth and you know and he realizes uh how that he dealt with this problem and

12
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,880
uh he asked him you how how did you do that you know what you know how were you able to do

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:38,560
that and the monk said well you know when he had the idea he you know he was resting in his coutti and uh he decided

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,079
to do this he asked himself you know uh you know he had a dull right at that

15
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:52,200
point the pain was dull he says well you know does it hurt I'm you know pulling the tooth right this moment he said no

16
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:00,360
doesn't doesn't hurt now he start walking to the shed and he asked himself well does it hurt now nope and he kept

17
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,159
walking to the shed holds the door open no doesn't hurt and then he put the

18
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:13,080
pliers to his tooth and he asked himself does it hurt no he yanked you know and

19
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,640
uh was why that hurt you know and um you know and then it was over you know and

20
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,440
um and you know the moral of course is the fact that he didn't spend all that

21
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,080
time caught in dread and anticipation how much more suffering do

22
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,319
we cause ourselves to avoid that one moment of pain or that very short period

23
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,840
of pain you know we can spend weeks in that state some of us uh just avoiding

24
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,720
that and um I told the story to uh one of my students you know and he came back

25
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,840
to me like a a couple months later and said you know I just used that when I went to get my blood drawn you know he

26
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,920
said he used to dread getting his blood drawn for days before and he said I just kept asking myself is

27
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,680
it hurting now no and um but um you know this this

28
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:16,720
brings me to the topic of the of this talk which is investigation and um that was what uh he

29
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:24,440
was actually doing investigating what's happening right now you know it's not the imagination of of you know what's

30
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:31,519
you know the dread the fear what's happening right now there's no pain and right now uh if we just keep coming back

31
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,080
to that you know what's happening here what's happening now um and that's the

32
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,519
wisdom that can come from investigation

33
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:48,239
um the Buddha taught that everything we need to learn on the path to

34
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:56,360
Freedom um can be discovered through our own powers of Investigation everything um you know and

35
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,680
he basically what he taught us is to train that ability um you know to to

36
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,879
develop that power investigation that really sees clearly what's happening at

37
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:13,400
any given moment um you know a lot of us um you

38
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,880
know who grew up with TV shows and things like that you know and uh there a

39
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,199
lot of crime shows you know there's always like the investigation right and the investigation always in my mind was

40
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,400
like you know this um you know they're trying to solve a crime and but you know

41
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:37,800
what what it has in common with investigation that we use in practice is that in in the crime scene they're

42
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:45,800
looking at the details of the crime scene what are all the details there and they're looking for what's out of place

43
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:53,600
what's something unusual you know so they're just noticing everything that there is and in a very similar way we do

44
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,840
that with when we investigate our own minds we know look at the details of our

45
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:05,000
experience what's really happening here not what we want to be happening here but what's

46
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,160
really happening here and we notice instead of what's out of place or

47
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,000
doesn't belong we notice what causes us stress what causes us contraction what

48
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,440
we're pushing away what we're pulling towards us so we notice those things and

49
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,360
when we notice those things it gives us a choice you know we can either continue

50
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:34,199
you know pushing something away or we can just look again oh what's happening here oh look this is how pushing

51
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:42,759
something away feels like and so and this is like the power that we develop the ability to keep uh

52
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:50,280
seeing what's here and when stress rises in any form uh to make the choice to let

53
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,199
go of the stress in whatever way uh skillful way we

54
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:02,360
find um you know many meditation and um in in

55
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:10,199
inside meditation uh mindfulness and an investigation go hand in hand they work

56
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,720
together most of the time when we're applying it we're not we don't we're not thinking of applying investigation

57
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:22,880
you're just doing it um and for instance if um one way to think of it is like

58
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,039
when we're looking at the um at the breath you know think of it it like an

59
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:34,440
apple instead okay you're looking at an apple and you know it's an apple you know you recognize it and and you're

60
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,919
paying enough attention that you know it's an apple in your hand but if you investigate it you'll go wow that's got

61
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:46,160
you know a lot of red on this side some green over here and um you know wow this

62
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,880
one's kind of flat looking Apple I had one of those the other day it was just the flattest Apple I'd ever seen it was

63
00:06:51,880 --> 00:07:00,560
just like kind of squished and um you know so you see all those little details um and um you know mindfulness

64
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,759
just sees that the apple is there and then you have the quality of

65
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,879
concentration that keeps you paying attention so you're looking at the Apple and suddenly you're somewhere else right

66
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:17,800
and concentration says no this is a task at hand let's look at this apple uh and so you've got all these

67
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,919
three qualities that are kind of working together so when we're watching the

68
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:29,960
breath and and we're you know just knowing we're watching the breath and then we start fading away and like how

69
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,120
of the mind gets dull we can apply a little more oh what's really happening

70
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,240
here and you start looking at the little details and there's such a difference in

71
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,840
the breath sometimes when you're kind of seeing it like oh yeah uhuh in out one two or you're like really right there

72
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:55,759
you know sometimes um I've used the term um caressing the breath you know it's

73
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:02,800
like if you're caressing a young child or or a dog you love love you're not spaced out kind of yeah yeah I'm

74
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:10,759
caressing the dog you know but you're like you know enjoying it there's a engagement in it and so sometimes you

75
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:18,000
know with the breath you know can bring that intimacy with the breath that really being there with it very

76
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,199
closely um you know and sometimes you know it's not that everything we do uh

77
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,960
all forms of Investigation are are tiny in detail you know sometimes you know it it's like

78
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:39,080
looking through microscope right and you have have most of you looked through M microscope once you know or seing

79
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:48,839
pictures you know and and God it's so alive in there sometimes there's so much going on um you know blood cells or um

80
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,560
you know I saw uh um vitamin C you know in in one of those really Ultra

81
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:02,320
microscopes you know and it looked like this incredible mandala it was just beautiful and so you know if you look

82
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:09,600
really closely things open up in a different way you know but then at other times what's useful in practice is to

83
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,640
open up the vision open up your uh scope of attention and make it broader and

84
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,600
it's kind of like looking at the night sky looking at the telescope through telescope right you see millions of

85
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:29,440
details out there you know it's not you're going to focus on all of them right you go bananas uh but you just um

86
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,680
yeah getting a fruit salad here apple banana um so it's it gets really big and

87
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,959
but within that largess uh we see different kind of details and um you

88
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:50,079
know and same thing in meditation you know sometimes like you know if the mind's really sluggish you know I'm sure

89
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,720
all of you have experienced a little bit of that sloth and torper that happens on occasion you know where it just starts

90
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,200
drifting and you know paying really close attention can really uh help and

91
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,560
really noticing those really minute parts of the breath but if you're um um

92
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,360
really restless mind you know uh it can be really helpful to uh open up the

93
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,839
attention really big give it room um

94
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,120
the the image we use sometimes is the image of uh Wild Horses you know we put

95
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,040
them in a Corral you know and they're really miserable right they're they they're just you know trying to get out

96
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:40,760
and you put them in a wide pasture and they're moving fast and happily but they're they're just so so beautiful and

97
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:48,079
graceful and and so a a fast mind a busy mind a Restless mind we don't have to

98
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:54,920
change it we just have to know oh it's a Restless busy mind we don't have to push

99
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:01,680
it away we we see it we investigate it what is like to have a busy mind oh it's

100
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,880
beautiful it's like wild horses up there you know it's like we can allow it allow

101
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,839
it to be that way

102
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,320
um you know we can say there's um like two aspects to

103
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,760
investigation um they're seeing what's there right this is a p pie of paper uh

104
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:37,079
this is a bell you know seeing the details of my environment you know and I sat down I looked really carefully that

105
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:42,839
I didn't sit on anything especially the microphone um you know so you see those

106
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:48,839
details um but the other part of Investigation in in the practice in the

107
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:55,480
Dharma is the discernment the ability to see distinctions between things right

108
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,639
the details distinctions but to see which ones are help helpful in terms of

109
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:07,880
freeing the heart freeing the mind and which ones actually aren't helpful you know such as um you know we're we're

110
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,920
meditating and and suddenly we find ourselves in this wonderful fantasy I

111
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:19,639
mean it's really enjoyable you know it doesn't seem like it's causing us any Duke at that moment any stress it's just

112
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:25,399
a wonderful fantasy you know and the mind goes oh I'm you know there's uh I'm

113
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:32,880
in a just spend some lot of time my fantasy I kind of want to go back it was really juicy you know and um you know

114
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,079
but investigation says is is this forward leading to the reason you're

115
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,959
actually here why are you here right you you took this time to meditate right you

116
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:49,760
can fantasize any time it's not it's not bad it's not a wrong thing it just isn't

117
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,040
what you're doing and so it sees it discerns that's not helpful for what

118
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:02,639
we're trying to do here which is train the mind train the mind you know it's not making that

119
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,399
wrong and you know and like that's such an important point because I know that

120
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,440
um um you know how many of you have had a meditation and said that was a bad

121
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:22,519
sitting you know you may not have said it out loud but you know but but you've thought that right you know and um and

122
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:31,199
that piece of of um unhelpful thinking um is uh really important piece

123
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:38,800
because um you know we're training we're not training the mind to stay on the breath

124
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,399
we're not training the mind to stay concentrated we're training the mind to

125
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:51,880
be free of attachment that's what we're training the mind and so sometimes we get stuck and

126
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,000
we mistake that we think that the um the purpose of the meditation was for it to

127
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,680
be a certain way but the purpose of meditation is to show

128
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:09,399
up enough that we see how we cause our own suffering and the more clearly we see

129
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:17,079
that the easier it is to begin to have it fade away and to and to let go of it

130
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:22,360
and so when we think that's a bad meditation that moment is a moment of not seeing

131
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,720
clearly you know what did we learn you know how do we how do we meet uh or EXP

132
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:36,560
experience when it's not what we want um the other image sometimes I have

133
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:44,880
is that um um you know I'm walking down a path I'm hiking you know and there's the road

134
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,920
in the you know the the traditional uh fork in the road and uh on the left is

135
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,680
the is the way I always go home it's a short way you know and on the right it's a little bit longer longer way so I

136
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,079
rarely take it and as said walking you know I'm I'm kind of really want to get

137
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,320
home already you know and so I'm ready to go go left but all of a sudden

138
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:15,959
because I'm being Mindful and investigating I noticed that path is really muddy it's really muddy right now

139
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:23,360
and the other path is kind of on the sunny side and it's pretty dry and and uh so I make a choice I'm going to take

140
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,680
this side because this is taking me home this is taking me home in an easier way

141
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,319
it doesn't make the other path bad or wrong or a failure or anything it's just

142
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:41,199
how it is right now that's not helpful and so when the um torments of

143
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:47,519
the Mind rise right you know the that we all have these Universal things that

144
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:53,040
happen in our minds you know where we're contracted and and unhappy about our

145
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,240
experience when those things arise oh that's what arose it's not wrong for

146
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,880
being there you know we investigate it and that investigation of that is a

147
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,639
wholesome factor of mind we already transforming it for instance if um your

148
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:19,240
habit of mind is worrying right some some people really worry a lot they're always worrying about stuff right so the

149
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:27,160
moment you see oh that's worry you're no longer worrying you're now investigating

150
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:33,120
you've already changed the picture you've already opened the container up

151
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,480
and this is actually the way to freedom from worry when we do that it weakens

152
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:46,120
that habit of worry every time it weakens that habit of worry so when the

153
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,920
meditation um ends and we're unhappy with what happened we investigate that

154
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:59,639
unhappiness oh I had an expectation you know I wanted I didn't get things my way you know that's that's

155
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:05,438
the Dharma the teachings the Dharma you know getting getting what we want uh you

156
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:12,240
know needing to get what we want trying to always get what we want is what cause us suffering you know life is going to give

157
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,199
us at least half of what we don't want yeah and so really being able to be

158
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,600
happy whether we get what we want or we don't get what we

159
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
want

160
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:45,280
you know how we investigate you know um when we're relaxed and we're paying

161
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,520
attention investigation just shows up you know if you have you ever had um a

162
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:58,640
wonderful conversation with a friend and you're just interested you're not working at it you're not uh doing

163
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:06,799
anything difficult you're just there you're enjoying the conversation you're just interested and in the same way um you

164
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,240
know if we're interested in the breath and we're noticing the details we're not working at

165
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:20,320
it um but when we get caught by something um it's very easy to lose that

166
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,640
relaxation right when we get caught by um let's say um you know one of my

167
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,720
favorite um hindrances has always been noise while I'm meditating you know uh

168
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:37,559
that has got me caught you know a really loud noise like um um we used to live in

169
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:42,880
the desert in this really beautiful pristine Space 2 and a half acres was so

170
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,520
beautiful and quiet and all of a sudden at 6:30 in the morning these young guys

171
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,880
in their motorcycles would come through the dirt roads and just circle area over

172
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:01,320
and over and over again you know and I would just H rage would rise and and um

173
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:07,120
you know meditating yes rage would rise you know and uh and you know and so how

174
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,320
do you meet that how do you meet that you know there was the displeasure of

175
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,520
the noise very unpleasant and it came and then went

176
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,559
came and went you know and then there was the idea that how dare they they

177
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:28,039
shouldn't be doing this there's all this extra stuff that came up all this extra

178
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:33,480
stuff stuff and I kept um you know negotiating my mind how do I fix it you

179
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:41,799
know um you know get a water pistol you know all sorts of creative ideas right

180
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:46,919
um and um you know but but you know what's really important is what do we do

181
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:52,320
in our own heart you know how do we meet those things in our own

182
00:19:52,320 --> 00:20:01,000
heart um I remember being really impressed When U I heard heard that um uh I think

183
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,039
Bernie Glassman I think was his name um you know is a zen teacher he used to he

184
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:13,120
held uh um these 10-day Retreats um under a bridge under a very

185
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,799
busy bridge where cars were going freeway freeway bridge and um and

186
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:25,039
everybody who took the retreat was supposed to uh have no money no

187
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,360
possessions um and just come as they are you know and just to live there that way

188
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:37,679
with nothing and for 10 days you know and uh um you know and that's really the

189
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:44,159
practice of letting go of really okay can we be at peace in ourselves when

190
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:52,200
we're not getting what we want you know when things aren't the way we want them to be including our mind State and

191
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:58,200
that's the really the real key thing here is to be okay even when our mind

192
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:04,840
State isn't okay and so for instance you know when I was like very

193
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:11,480
um uh very very angry and uptight and and I I'm I'm meditating right yeah I'm

194
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,480
going to do some loving kindness towards those you

195
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,240
know um you know that that was the state of my mind you know and then you know it

196
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:29,240
finally grows the memory of of um aun Su talking about a affectionate

197
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:36,880
curiosity you know and that's how he likes to describe curiosity the quality of mind that's affectionate you know

198
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,679
this it's not curiosity for curiosity sake it's a friendly curiosity and so I turned the

199
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:51,480
affectionate curiosity towards my anger and turmoil and and really saw that pain in

200
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,000
myself you know how much worse it was that that unpleasant noise God it was so

201
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,240
much worse than that unpleasant Pleasant noise you so it's able to really apply that you know that that kind um you know

202
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,600
it's a little bit um you know when our mind's having a tantrum you know not

203
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,400
different than when a four-year-old's having that tantrum right it's pretty similar you know a lot of that that you

204
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,600
know I didn't get my ice cream and the whole world's falling down on my head because I didn't get my ice cream you

205
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:28,279
know it's really serious matter you know for to that four-year-old and and so that's what her mind's doing it's a

206
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:35,000
tantrum right and so with a child you go you kind of smile you go a you know this

207
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,320
sweet affectionate you know oh look at how they're doing that let me just support them while they have their

208
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,360
tantrum and and it'll be over and and you know and again we can do that with

209
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:53,559
our own mind you know we can do that with ourselves you know wherever we find contraction we can we can bring

210
00:22:53,559 --> 00:23:00,000
kindness you know investigation gives us that choice investigation shows us we're

211
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
not trapped in that in in that turmoil uh that we have a choice to be mindful

212
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,760
to see what's here and to let go of what we can let go not to force ourselves to

213
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:19,520
let go but to let go what let's go relax into the turmoil you know allow it to move

214
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,880
through us every form of turmoil every emotion every contraction comes and goes

215
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
eventually

216
00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:00,000
you know one of the things that we often forget is that um we actually can choose

217
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,919
what thoughts we're going to have in some way by um just by changing what

218
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:15,320
we're paying attention to what the focus of our attention is you know for instance um um you know if let's say

219
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,919
we're in the car um uh I saw these puddles here so this is appropriate in

220
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:27,000
my mind so and we find we got a flat tire you know and uh and so we get out

221
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,919
of the car and you know we've done everything we need to do we call work we say we're going to be late and you know

222
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:38,880
we call triaa to help us you know come and change her tire and um and then we

223
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,279
just have to wait right and you know day like today you know it's um you know and

224
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:49,559
we can sit there and you know and our mind can just be focused on oh God I'm

225
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:57,320
you know I'm going to be late I'm going to have all this work to do T all the stuff that goes on through mind that's worried and and having an unpleasant

226
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:05,320
experience right or we can actually shift our attention to what's here you know oh

227
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,480
it's a beautiful day beautiful sky you know and it's the same thing we

228
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,679
do in our meditation right you know we're caught up in worry we don't have

229
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:22,080
to keep you know uh kind of uh scratching at that scab you know it's

230
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,159
like uh you know the worry that cycle of worry or cycle of planning where we're

231
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:33,120
just you know massaging it to death you know and so we can just uh shift the

232
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,480
attention to oh look from to a little bigger point of view you know watching

233
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,799
it you know it's like oh look at that worry going on you know see what's happening you know look at the how the

234
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,000
body feels with that worry you know I'm not relaxed can I relax into it and

235
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,559
allow the worry not make it wrong not oh we got to go away go away you know no

236
00:25:55,559 --> 00:26:00,799
you know we we we just allow it to be there until it goes away it will go away

237
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:06,720
in its own when we give it room we give it space and when we give it uh

238
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,760
curiosity you know

239
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:31,880
um when we're caught in something um you know sometimes you know when

240
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,840
things are simple in meditation it's very simple to investigate but sometimes

241
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,360
when the mind is caught in a hindrance and it's it feels like very complicated

242
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,720
you know and so one of the ways that I investigate um you know since it just

243
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,200
feels like too confusing to know what do I investigate here what do I pay attention to there's so much chaos going

244
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,320
on in my mind and so I look look to the body first you know uh how is the body

245
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,640
is the body relaxed here because we can't have a we don't have contracted states in the mind without something

246
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,720
Contracting in the body and then um I might notice uh then

247
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:21,600
I go to the heart to the to the emotional state you know how how are my emotions right now you know and um and

248
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:29,720
that's where I notice uh um I might notice I'm unhappy um with uh what's happening this

249
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,760
is just such a you know terrible meditation I'm a terrible terrible meditator and that's well that's more

250
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:42,000
the cognitive side you know because these ideas if I was a good meditator this wouldn't be happening right I

251
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,600
wouldn't be here um if I was a mature person I wouldn't be having these immature thoughts um if I was you know

252
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:57,960
all these ideas that we have in our minds so we notice how we feel about things maybe there's uh um fear going on

253
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,559
maybe there's um sadness going on maybe we're lonely all these different things

254
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:09,120
that human beings can experience so look to the body to the

255
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:16,519
feelings to the thoughts about the how we are and we also can look to a

256
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:23,320
motivation you know it's obvious the body heart and mind you know those are the things that are there all the time

257
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,600
but our motivation something that can get away from us we that can go un seen

258
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:35,679
and and really this is in some ways it's like right the heart of the practice are we wanting or are we wanting to push

259
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:42,279
something away and that sometimes is just you know the all our miseries I want something I

260
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:47,360
want a better meditation I want it to be more fulfilling I want want want want

261
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,840
and that moving forward doesn't allow us to see what's here to be with this you

262
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,120
know or you don't like what you're you know what you feeling you want to push it

263
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:05,640
away you know wanting it to go away wanting things to change neither it it's

264
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:12,320
funny in some ways they exactly the same thing not wanting things the way they are you know wanting them to be

265
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:20,120
different but sometimes we experience it as wanting to have something else and

266
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,200
sometimes we experience it as wanting to push away what's there and so however

267
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,640
you feel it in the moment what you your experiences in the

268
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:46,720
moment and you know just say a general rule that I really appreciate you know when I heard this many years ago um if

269
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,760
we're struggling anytime we're struggling something is being left out of our

270
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:58,399
attention it's kind of an interesting thought if you really bring that to

271
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:05,559
heart whenever we're struggling even when we're struggling um um doing

272
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:10,640
something physical you know um it may be for

273
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:18,200
instance um you know I remember when I was learning to um uh use a hammer you

274
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:25,480
know and I just kept trying to control the experience right you know to you know to get it just right you know and

275
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:33,519
it felt like a struggle you know and um you know it really took convincing for me to let go you know and

276
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:40,360
it's something that I didn't miss you know I miss plenty you know but but the trust to let go you know and at that

277
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:46,080
point I I stopped struggling to try to get it right and that made all the

278
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,600
difference in the world stopping the struggle you know so anytime we're

279
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:58,360
struggling in our own minds and our own Hearts you know there's something we're not seeing it maybe difficult whatever

280
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:04,000
we need to do it might be difficult but there's a difference between doing something difficult you know like

281
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,799
climbing a mountain where it's really you know Steep and you've been going for an hour and your legs are really tired

282
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,880
it's difficult but you don't have to struggle it's just difficult it's just

283
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:22,720
unpleasant might be very unpleasant but we don't have to struggle with it we don't have to add all this

284
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,000
other stuff and so if we're struggling what are we not seeing

285
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,159
aversion right we don't like the fact that it's hard and we're adding that to

286
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:39,440
our experience of difficulty which is a burden actually if we're just with a

287
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:45,200
difficult it's not as hard as if we're with a difficult and then with the attitude that it shouldn't be this way

288
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,200
that adds a lot of

289
00:31:53,679 --> 00:32:00,120
extra you know the investigation in the deeper practices of meditation you know

290
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:08,679
it's called um the tool tool for wisdom you know damaya it's the um the wisdom

291
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:16,000
that arises from this and this really points to the Discerning aspect of

292
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,720
Investigation the part that sees what's helpful what's forward leading and what's not

293
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,519
helpful and um you know this is uh um

294
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:34,000
Insight Meditation and at every level of practice we have different types of

295
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,200
insights that arise you know when we're um sometimes listening to Dharma talk we

296
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:46,200
can have very very wonderful Insight you know sometimes a teacher says something

297
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:52,519
and it really resonates with us you know I'm sure all of you have been coming regularly you know it's one of the

298
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:59,200
things that brings you back is there so much resonates with something inside you that knows a lot the Dharma is true you

299
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,480
know this this stuff is true it works um and

300
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:14,200
um and you know and then there's this we uh investigate maybe while we're meditating you know and all these um uh

301
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,240
um the mind is having trouble stabilizing you know and we have the

302
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,720
understanding the an investigation that if we just uh really pay attention to

303
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,440
the breath the Mind event calms yeah oh it does actually calm and

304
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,880
at some point becomes really something we understand we we it's an insight into the way our mind

305
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:45,840
works and also at other times and you know our personal stories show up and um

306
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,679
you know I I'll give you an example of like for me one of the um one of the

307
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:57,279
things that happened to me uh I noticed on Retreat you know I was meditating and

308
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:04,080
I would notice um that there was just something wasn't quite quite right you know it's like I

309
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:11,000
was staying on the breath I was calm but there was just like this overall tone in my mind that was just slightly off and I

310
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and I I just couldn't pinpoint it I just kept practicing practicing and looking more carefully and what I noticed is

311
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,520
that every time my mind drifted when it came back I feel like I

312
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:32,398
had failed you know or having gone away and that habit of thinking that every time I

313
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,919
went my mind drifted I had failed was so strong in me I watched it time after

314
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:46,200
time even while I'm watching it it's going it's doing it again wow you know that sinking feeling of failure that

315
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:53,720
sinking feeling of failure and so I watched it for a really long time as it slowly got a little bit less and I

316
00:34:53,720 --> 00:35:00,440
wasn't drifting that much it was it was interesting because it was a um on a daily uh meditation I would have

317
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:07,560
thought I was doing really well but on Retreat you know I'm expecting it to be much less drifting you know and

318
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:14,280
expectation of course and so um you know and as as uh I started seeing it more

319
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:22,160
and more carefully you know I started getting more affectionate to it you know more soft with it more and as it finally

320
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:29,920
just kind of faded you know so I don't that doesn't just doesn't arise anymore for me um but things like that don't

321
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,920
necessarily go away with one time of seeing them I mean I don't want to give you that false idea some things do but a

322
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:44,680
lot of things you know it takes years sometimes for some of those things to um to be let go of you know and

323
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:51,359
um I've learned not to um you know I've learned to accept what let's go and uh

324
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:58,920
and accept what doesn't let go yet you know that's been a big part of my practice is is uh is seeing that the

325
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,520
things we're still holding on to are there you know and it's part of the wisdom we

326
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:12,119
have um you know and often we you know we have what I call personal insights you

327
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:19,000
know and I've mentioned um you know the mind can have repetitive patterns you know that whenever the mind isn't

328
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,920
focusing on something it has a fall back right and for some people that fall back might be

329
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:31,880
planning you know how many of you did some planning while you're meditating right you know it's um oh this is what

330
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,960
I'm going you this what I'm going to do later okay um and you know but most of the planning we do in meditation is

331
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,079
actually often not useful planning it's often just compulsive planning that

332
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:48,680
isn't particularly helpful um you know and these are personal

333
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:55,440
insights when we see these inside ourselves and again we don't force ourselves to stop planning but we see

334
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,839
what what's driving that plan planning you know what's driving that um you know

335
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:07,839
for myself cuz you know I'm a really good planner I mean you know it's a skill and and um was always my tendency

336
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:14,000
to do this in meditation too um but part of planning for me was enjoyable you

337
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,599
know I like planning you know it's fun and but when it's fun I feel happy you

338
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:26,000
know it's like oh let's let's plan this project together you know it's always fun and exciting but often I'd find the

339
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,760
planning in meditation was not that kind of planning was the other kind and um it

340
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,440
would be this uh kind of contracted you know we're having friends over for dinner I'm going to make blah blah blah

341
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,960
blah well maybe I'll make this maybe I'll sit this person over here maybe I'll do this you know and just these

342
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,720
kind of you you know unhelpful things that arise from this anxiety or worry

343
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:54,560
underneath you know and as as we get curious about it you know we don't we

344
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,839
don't need to shove it away and go back to the the breath you know we just get curious about it and we notice oh this

345
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:07,040
is how worry feels that anxiety feels in my body this is what's here oh okay I

346
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,280
can relax into it I can allow that I don't have to fight it and it will go

347
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:18,119
away it will just move move away it will change everything changes right

348
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:24,599
including worry and planning and we allow it and as we return we return

349
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:30,200
without that have been wrong that having been something that we blew you know

350
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:37,560
it's just oh back home welcome home nice to be back you know and and um and so

351
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:43,560
we're developing a wholesome attitude in our in our entire meditation in the

352
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:49,720
times when things arise that are contracted and difficult and in the times when things feel like they're

353
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:55,119
wonderful you know it's a wholesome attitude of Mind of

354
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:01,520
heart um you know and when when the Awakening

355
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:09,880
Factor investigation is really well established you know and and this is where um

356
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:17,720
Retreat practice can really help take us much deeper into this and um we can

357
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:24,599
see um you know we start seeing investigating much subtler levels of

358
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:30,800
reality so instead of noticing kind of the the grossness of oh my stomach feels

359
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,000
tied uh you know not gross but you know there there're it there's so much more

360
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,200
subtleness we start experiencing and we start seeing that everything on a very

361
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:47,880
deep level arises and passes away we all know we all know intellectually that

362
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:54,440
everything's impermanent right nobody would argue with that you know that everything is you know is

363
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:02,280
impermanent um and every everything goes away there's nothing we'll ever be able to keep so intellectually realize that

364
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,880
if everything's going away nothing can make us permanently happy right you know

365
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,920
so um as we practice in the deeper levels

366
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:21,440
of practice we start seeing that kind of in a bone deep level that's it's just so

367
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,520
much deeper that um it's not in the intellect it's non verbal it's a

368
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:34,040
nonverbal knowing that nothing out there is going to satisfy that there's nowhere

369
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:39,480
out there to look for the satisfaction there's nothing in here to look for

370
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:48,960
satisfaction um you know and it's a letting go it's a Letting Go a deeper and deeper letting go and that's the why

371
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:55,520
investigation is the tool of wisdom because it it brings us to the

372
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:02,040
realization which is not again not an intellectual realization that there's nothing worth

373
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:09,599
holding on to you know there's nothing worth grabbing on to grasping you know and the

374
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:15,359
that freedom that comes from that is what allows a very deep peace you know

375
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:22,319
and we can touch on that at times and we can um live with it at times and

376
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:27,400
sometimes it just arises for little pieces here and there but however it is

377
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:34,400
this this is the path of practice this is where the practice takes us to the point of you know not grabbing on to

378
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,720
anything you know to these fleeting lives these fleeting bodies you know these

379
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:48,319
um um you know everything um everything in life the trees the beautiful trees

380
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:53,640
and so it calls us to just be here be here with what's here our life's here

381
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:59,440
not in the future we become good meditators you know it's kind of this beautiful

382
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:07,440
balance in the practice between uh being fully here and yet um being on a path

383
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,040
that's forward leading you know stepping here here here

384
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,520
but yet also knowing that we're forward leading developing our minds developing

385
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:25,760
the direction of Freedom so I'm going to just end with a

386
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,480
very short quote by Ashan

387
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:40,480
sha peace within us is to be found in the same place as agitation and

388
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:47,880
suffering it's not found in a forest or a Hilltop nor is it given by a

389
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:55,160
teacher where you experience suffering you can also find Freedom from

390
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:01,880
suffering trying to run away from suffering is actually running towards

391
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,640
it so thank you

392
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,160
all
