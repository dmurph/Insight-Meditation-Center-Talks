1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:18,240
good day good beginning of the week a minute

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,400
and um

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,320
so it's probably a little confusing for some of you that we've switched now back to

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,760
meeting at 7 00 am for the meditation and i think it was over many of us it

5
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,320
was quite wonderful to be starting at 6 45 last week and have the 45 minutes sitting

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,640
and the plan is to do that again next week starting on monday

7
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,719
and then we can assess for one week and then we can assess whether to

8
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,199
continue this way somehow or other or do it once a month or not do it at all

9
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:19,920
and so the in terms of the

10
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,320
16 steps of mindfulness of breathing we've gone through the first eight and

11
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,560
today is to introduce the ninth and that is to become aware

12
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,799
of the mind knowing the mind breathing in one knows the mind

13
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,439
breathing out one knows the mind and what exactly

14
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:54,320
the mind is is a fascinating topic and maybe there's no final

15
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,960
to be made about what the mind is some people call it the mind heart some people call it the heart the pali

16
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,240
word is chitta and i'll talk more about later but for

17
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,440
now i want to say that use an analogy

18
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:19,200
that if you're driving maybe on a long trip with the car and you just don't notice that slowly

19
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,720
the windshield is getting dirty it slowly slowly builds up over time

20
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:33,360
and driving is so important you're very focused on the traffic the road the driving itself

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,599
and so you're focusing on what's beyond the windshield and so you don't really notice the

22
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,920
windshield but the windshield's getting more and more dirty and what you also don't notice then is

23
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,360
the strain to have to look more carefully through the dirt

24
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,959
so this is an example of how if um we might not know recognize the filter

25
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,599
through which we are aware of things because we're often focusing on something in

26
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,879
particular just like we're often when we think we think about something

27
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:18,720
so our awareness is usually about something we're aware of but how we're aware is not really so

28
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,239
easily seen or prioritized and then with the driving if you could

29
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,080
stop at a gas station and wash your window and then get in the car and you go wow

30
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,519
now it's clean that is impressive and and you realize how much easier and more

31
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,400
relaxing it is to drive without straining through the dirty window so

32
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,080
so this is what uh the topic is for today is mindfulness of the mind and uh take a

33
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,120
while to kind of really explain what it is but with that introduction

34
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,239
uh please begin in your meditation posture

35
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,959
and and uh if your mind is going to be about

36
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,880
something thinking about something aware of something

37
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,080
be aware for a few moments of your posture and to really become even more aware

38
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,120
you might kind of sway back and forth rock back and forth

39
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,320
and re-establish your posture maybe making smaller movements as you

40
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,560
kind of really get settled and kind of whatever you know

41
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,840
make a small adjustments really feel where the posture is

42
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,280
comfortable not comfortable aligned not aligned in a way that works for you

43
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,840
maybe there can be small adjustments

44
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:10,479
and then letting the body become still and now the focus of attention can be

45
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,199
maybe the stillness of the body

46
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,000
just what it's like to have the body still not moving

47
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,680
and if in feeling the still body there feels like more adjustments are needed

48
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,639
herb would be good please do

49
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,680
and the next focus of attention can be

50
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,520
the breathing of the body wherever breathing is most easy for you

51
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,080
to experience in the belly the movements of the chest movements of

52
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,000
the air going in and out through the nostrils

53
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,600
and then to take a few long slow deep breaths

54
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:17,520
three quarters full and for as long as it's comfortable for

55
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,639
you a long slow exhale

56
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:35,120
long slow exhale when you get to the end of the exhale

57
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,840
briefly maybe then just barely perceptibly pause

58
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,840
before you inhale pause so the inhale

59
00:06:49,919 --> 00:07:03,840
really feels like it wants to start itself and allow it to start

60
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:16,800
and then letting your breathing return to normal and now bring your attention

61
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,240
to focus on the parts of the body that might be easy to relax

62
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:31,280
maybe the muscles of the face the eyes almost like the muscles of the

63
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,680
face can be spread wide to the side maybe

64
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,360
where they can sink down sliding down the bones of the skull

65
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:13,840
perhaps as you exhale the softening of the shoulders releasing of the tension

66
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,479
and then softening the belly

67
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:34,080
if it's difficult to soften relax the belly be content to do it in very small

68
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:43,279
degrees maybe relaxing around the place of most

69
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
tension

70
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,959
and then let your attention receive the experience of the body

71
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:15,040
breathing in the belly the chest the nostrils

72
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:23,839
or globally all of that in some easy way

73
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,240
maybe letting there be

74
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,600
a little pause at the end of the exhale

75
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:51,760
maybe just barely perceptible a relaxed pause

76
00:09:51,760 --> 00:10:05,839
and then allow the inhale to start itself receive the inhale

77
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:19,839
receiving the inhale and awareness

78
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:32,800
riding the release of the exhale

79
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:47,839
releasing yourself with the release of the exhale

80
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,279
releasing your thoughts as you exhale

81
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,440
and as the thoughts release maybe there's more space in the

82
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,160
awareness to feel the fullness of breathing in and

83
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,839
breathing out

84
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:06,560
and then also notice if there's any tension or pressure agitation in the mind

85
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,959
and as you exhale perhaps you can soften the mind

86
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,440
release the tension of the mind

87
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,680
soften the thinking muscle

88
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,639
maybe where the sense of the mind becomes more open

89
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:53,920
expansive mind has mind has more room

90
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:04,399
lots of room in which breathing in and breathing out

91
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:17,839
is known

92
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:22,880
and then become aware as you're following your breathing

93
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:30,800
become aware of how you're aware what's the attitude or mood

94
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,399
that comes along with being aware

95
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:55,839
what's the mental atmosphere

96
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:05,600
is the general mood or atmosphere [Music] attitude of the mind

97
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:23,839
is it pleasant or is it unpleasant

98
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:37,839
is it more on the side of contentment or of discontentment

99
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,560
is the quality of the mind field does a mind feel more small

100
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:02,839
located in a particular place or does it feel more large

101
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:09,360
expansive may be difficult to locate in any one

102
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
place

103
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:46,640
the general quality of your mind your inner life

104
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,600
your mind heart

105
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:05,919
what's the emotional tone not of particular thoughts or impulses

106
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,760
but the background tone or the

107
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,840
atmosphere of it all

108
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,000
and without any kind of judgment of how it is

109
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:31,200
what happens to you as you gently honestly

110
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,559
recognize something about the quality of the mind

111
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,840
the mood the attitude the atmosphere

112
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:07,200
not to be thinking about this with more feeling or sensing

113
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,840
a quiet awareness

114
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:25,840
of the mood of your mind state the state of the mind

115
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:39,120
and then whatever state of mind you have if you're aware of it breathe

116
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,000
with it as if breathing accompanies it

117
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,760
breathes through it

118
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:01,600
or whether or like the state of the mind accompanies the breathing

119
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,519
breathing in knowing the state of your mind

120
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,799
breathing out knowing the state of your

121
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,840
mind

122
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,039
in the way that you might experience humidity in the air

123
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,559
or the warmth of the sun standing in the sun

124
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,200
see if you can experience the state of the mind

125
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,080
the overall mood overall gestalt

126
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,840
of the inner mental life

127
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,120
is a characterized by a wanting

128
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,360
characterized by an aversion pushing away

129
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:27,120
they characterized by confusion

130
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:35,440
is it characterized by stability and presence or by distraction and

131
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:45,600
jumping around it's all okay just experience it as it is for you

132
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,840
breathe with it

133
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:08,000
and if it's possible to relax the mind or expand the mind

134
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:18,080
so the boundaries of whatever mind is are soft boundaries open boundaries

135
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:26,880
no boundaries and resting into that

136
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:35,440
expansive mind settling into the open mind

137
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,520
and breathing through it breathing with it

138
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,840
breathing at the center of it

139
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

140
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:06,559
maybe you can discern that or know the difference between

141
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:12,799
a mind that is small and closed and

142
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:21,679
involved in itself and a mind or heart which is open

143
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:31,840
open to receive and feel the world around it

144
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:38,960
maybe the difference can be like trying to talk and see someone through a

145
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:46,720
closed class door and then having the door open

146
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,840
and then seeing them and talking being with them

147
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:03,440
to open the mind to open the heart for it to be expansive and wide and

148
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:13,840
the mood and atmosphere the state of mind receptive and available

149
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:24,240
and in this mode either doing so or imagining it so

150
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:30,320
be take in the people of your life

151
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,559
people you might see today or talk to today or

152
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,480
think about today people on the street in your

153
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,440
neighborhood in your communities

154
00:29:51,679 --> 00:30:01,200
and to let them be received or known with a heart the mind wide open

155
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,799
at least for these minutes or two we're sitting here at the end of

156
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,000
meditation a time and place where it's safe to be

157
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,799
open-hearted

158
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:27,840
and then see if there's a greater sensitivity a greater

159
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,120
tenderness heartfeltness

160
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:41,600
in considering these people when the heart the mind is open

161
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:53,679
and then taking the idea of whatever that's come from this meditation practice

162
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:02,080
let it be offered up and be offered for the welfare and benefit

163
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,840
of others whatever calm or centeredness or

164
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:16,480
peacefulness may it be transformed into kindness for

165
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:26,240
the world care for the world may all beings be happy

166
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,840
may all beings be safe

167
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,240
may all beings be peaceful

168
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,840
may all beings everywhere be free

169
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:06,849
[Music]

170
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:13,299
[Music]

171
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,799
so we're beginning now with the ninth step

172
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:11,919
of anapanasati mindfulness of breathing in and mindfulness of breathing out and

173
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:19,039
the ninth step really builds on what what was earlier some teachers who teach anapanasati this

174
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:25,760
practice of 16 steps will insist that you should always begin with step one

175
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:34,559
and systematically work your way through all the steps as far as you you've gone so far you know and

176
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:42,080
there's some advantages to that some people's minds really like having order and having a real clear definitive

177
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:49,679
steps the mind gets organized it gets focused it gets concentrated knowing what it's doing step by step

178
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:56,320
other people find that it ties them in knots to do that that kind of trip over themselves it's too much trying

179
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:03,679
too much expectation and some people find that that it's good to be familiar with all

180
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,800
the steps and then as we sit and meditate i discover where we are

181
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,480
where the where the salient step is and sometimes we can start on step five

182
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,040
or start on step you know even step eight or even step nine any any of these steps because we sit

183
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,638
down and we're that's what's kind of available in a kind of way

184
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:33,358
and then sometimes we move through diff up and down in the course of a meditation so these steps are

185
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:39,919
can be done linearly linearly for those who find this beneficial and they can be more a resource for

186
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:45,760
those people who want to track themselves and understand kind of the domain the territory of what's

187
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,919
happening in their meditation any any one time what the emphasis is and um

188
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:57,200
but we get uh to then to the ninth step and one way of appreciating this though is

189
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,480
that um one way or the other it's helpful that the earlier steps have been

190
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,079
been familiar been developed in some degree and that's because the more we're

191
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,920
grounded in our body and the body is relaxed the more we begin opening up in a holistic way

192
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:20,880
to our experience and we begin kind of working through some of the knots some of the tanglements and tightnesses and tensions

193
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,240
that we have and then and then to go to the second

194
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:34,320
tetrad five to eight is to begin to fix feeling sensing

195
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,240
the emotional tone of the body and if you're quite relaxed and focused

196
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,680
it's a contentment and well-being and then with that it's easier to begin

197
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,280
trusting it's okay to relax the mental activity we don't have to be so actively involved

198
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,839
in fixing solving remembering planning criticizing whatever the mind is doing

199
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:03,839
and the activity the mind can bring to rest and this also this resting is releasing

200
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:09,760
bringing making the mental activity calmer continues this process of becoming more holistic being more

201
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:17,839
inclusive more open to our experience and then based on that the experience of the mind

202
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:25,599
becomes easier to experience so step nine is breathing in one experiences the mind

203
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:34,240
breathing out one experiences the mind and i love this word experience that

204
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:41,359
could the poly word could be translated as to feel the mind feel the the you know

205
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:48,079
feel the mind and um and so it's not thinking about the mind it's not having

206
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:56,800
ideas about the mind but it's something that is more holistic more broad and using kind of the

207
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:04,400
the range of sensory apparatus we have to take in our inner life but the mind

208
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:11,599
is not the details of the inner life not the particular activities as i've said the mind is just a sum

209
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:17,359
total of its mental activities but it's the way that we

210
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:24,240
can somehow take in the totality of that whatever way our mind and i want to

211
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:32,320
emphasize our mind your mind experiences the mood the mental state

212
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:40,880
the overall overall configuration or the kind of balance of it all that's what we call mind

213
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,720
and i say that because there's a lot of people who would like to have the mind

214
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:53,760
be something in particular to define it to know what the mind is and i don't think that that's really the

215
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,599
emphasis in this buddhist practice is to know in some abstract way what the mind

216
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,640
is and that's a topic for some other occasions some other purpose than

217
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:13,200
meditation in meditation we're only interested in how each of us experiences our mind

218
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:20,320
and for some people the word heart is a better translation for cheetah c-i-t-t-a

219
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:28,000
some people even translate it as heart mind and uh the um

220
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,960
but it's the kind of the it's the it's the so the state of the heart the state of

221
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:41,040
the mind the quality of our inner life it's the mood the atmosphere it's kind

222
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,160
of the sum total of how all this works and sometimes there's a predominant

223
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,520
mood of the mind so the predominant mood can be one of desire or

224
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:58,000
lust or strong wanting and and everything is kind of seen through

225
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:06,640
the filter of the strong wanting and the there's almost like the mind has a force overall force like give me that and

226
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:14,079
it's quite something we have a cat at home and it's i kind of delight somehow and amazed to see the cat definitely has

227
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:21,440
desires and it seems like everything and the whole catness is focused on getting what it wants and it's clear

228
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:28,160
that it you know the desire is there and and so the mood of desire this

229
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:34,720
disposition maybe mind is kind of like the overall disposition that we have

230
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,160
and and sometimes it's not desire you can feel the difference

231
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,640
between a general mood characterized by this desired design and one which is not

232
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:52,079
sometimes it's aversion hostility ill will and that's kind of you can kind of see

233
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:58,400
it sometimes in people that there's like almost a cloud of anger or hostility around them

234
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:04,640
and you know that atmosphere i'm sure is being experienced or could be experienced in the inside as well

235
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,440
or there can be the absence of ill will there could be love and then there can

236
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,680
be confusion that characterizes it all and the mind is jumping around not knowing what it

237
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,760
wants to do and doesn't understand kind of a lost feeling that's kind of the general tone of the

238
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,160
mind or the absence of confusion maybe there's clarity wisdom

239
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,920
the overall mood of the mind mind state can be one of destructibility jumping around

240
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,200
scatteredness or it could be one of being present and

241
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,040
undistracted and then one of the great ones that the tradition talks about

242
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,119
is one can know the mind is being expansive or large

243
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,160
or one can know the mind is not being expensive not being large

244
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:05,040
and this points to how as we become as we develop this mindfulness and as we develop a reflexive

245
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:12,960
awareness of awareness itself of the mind itself that seems to change the mind

246
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:20,640
that seems to change the kind of it's harder than to focus on on only the things that we're

247
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,880
thinking about or things we're aware of something begins happening when we're aware of awareness

248
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,359
aware of the mind that knows or then where the mind state it's kind of like if someone points out to you how

249
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:39,599
dirty the windshield is in a car then now you drive and you're now you're aware of the windshield you can't

250
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:47,040
you're not focusing on it but you can't not see it anymore so to become aware of the mind

251
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,480
changes the mind because the mind is not a physical thing

252
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,520
the mind is the one way of understanding it's a kind of this kind of the sum total

253
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:05,839
of the mental activities that are operating and one of the key mental activities is

254
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:11,599
the knowing of itself if the mind is known if we bring attention to the mind

255
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:17,520
and the attention is a not for or against the attention is not

256
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:24,960
with expectations with demands with criticism it just kind of a relaxed equanimous

257
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,359
allowing awareness of the mind that's a mental activity in itself

258
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:38,160
that then feeds back into the formation of the mind as a whole

259
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,960
and so we're shaping our mind all the time maybe the brain doesn't change that much

260
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,599
the mind is very flexible the buddha emphasized the mind is very very changeable

261
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:58,480
and and it changes with all our moods and activities and what's going on and so

262
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:05,040
mindfulness itself meditation itself does have an effect on how we experience

263
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,160
the mind and as we and here the instructions are

264
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:17,280
know the mind or experience the mind breathing in and breathing out

265
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:24,640
as we do that um because everything we do has with the mind hasn't

266
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:31,760
feeds back onto shaping the mind the experience of the mind we have and so now we're in this kind of can you

267
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:39,599
start being in this kind of um loop this kind of cycle this kind of where as

268
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,880
the meditation deepens uh we're bringing more and more equanimity more more

269
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,079
openness more and more receptivity to whatever experience is including that

270
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,359
of the mind and that has

271
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:01,040
creates some of the ver brings those qualities to the mind itself

272
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:08,319
so one of the reasons why in meditation practice we're trying to develop an equanimous mindfulness that's not for

273
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:15,920
or against experience it's good in and of itself but as that gets stronger it

274
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,400
feeds back to reshape or reform the disposition of the mind the quality

275
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,160
of the mind the state of the mind so the mind itself begins feeling more receptive

276
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:35,680
soft expansive and and all kinds of wonderful things

277
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:41,760
we'll talk more about so it might be that it's difficult to uh

278
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,599
some of you to follow what i'm saying but um but uh maybe you think about it as a

279
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,960
mood you're the your mood that you're in or

280
00:44:52,960 --> 00:45:01,200
the feeling tone the emotional tone of your inner life of your mind your heart and

281
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,440
and you can certainly be aware of it anytime at all but to be aware of it after having

282
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:13,040
meditated for some time for example the more or less the first eight steps

283
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:19,119
kind of prepares the ground for mindfulness of the mind to have this

284
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:25,040
wonderful feedback loop to continue to condition or

285
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:30,880
open the mind in a more deeper and deeper way that will allow for concentration to

286
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:38,000
develop so i'll talk more about these this mind thing over the next couple of days

287
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,200
so um in the meantime what you might do

288
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:49,440
is as you go about some of your daily tasks maybe some of the common things you do

289
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,520
something that you maybe do regularly through the day maybe washing up or cooking or driving or just

290
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:01,920
going for you know whatever you do why don't you start noticing the mood

291
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:08,160
with which you do it and then really know the mood and don't

292
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:13,200
just check it off oh you know i'm annoyed at the exercise

293
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:19,760
and don't just don't just check it off really experience the mood take time to

294
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:26,480
and one way to make sure you give enough time to experience the mood is to breathe with the mood take time

295
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:32,319
just breathe with it for a while and get to know it and start recognizing your mood

296
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:39,760
and start recognizing also how your mood shifts as it is known

297
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,119
as you experience it as you breathe with it and in daily life as you go through the

298
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:51,359
day don't overlook the windshield by looking

299
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:58,800
through it on to what's on the other side so um thank you all very much

300
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,640
and um and i'll say it a few times so this week we're meeting at seven o'clock

301
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,880
and um and then next week we'll meet next monday we'll start again at 6 45 for that week

302
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,880
and and because i'll be on retreat again and so it works really well from connecting

303
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:23,520
the two for the retreat practice and what we're doing here on youtube

304
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:36,240
so thank you very very much and i look forward to tomorrow
