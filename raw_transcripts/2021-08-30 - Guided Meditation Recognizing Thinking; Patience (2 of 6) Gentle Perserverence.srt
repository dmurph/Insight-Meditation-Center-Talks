1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:10,320
so good morning everyone and good day and

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:18,560
i'm quite happy to be back here and sitting here and continuing where we left off from a week ago on monday

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,560
and the topic still is patience and hopefully

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,640
you've been patient to wait for the continuation of this

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,480
so in a certain way

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,000
when we meditate we don't

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,600
accept the status quo in a certain way we don't just

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,000
sit and just allow things to be as they are

9
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,559
and there's a certain way in which we don't do that there's many ways depending on the meditation technique

10
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,119
and all kinds of things but the certain way with mindfulness is that

11
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,040
we always continue with the mindfulness practice

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:19,439
we always keep a steadiness coming back to it coming back to it being mindful again being mindful again

13
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,520
and and that makes a world of difference to accept the status quo is to not be

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,798
mindful and one way that

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,360
but some for some of you a simple way to

16
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,399
maintain the continuity to keep coming back to mindfulness not drift off in thought

17
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,840
is on every exhale it could be inhaled that people prefer

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,799
that every exhale you recognize whether or not you've started to think

19
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,000
again and just that mindfulness of thinking

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,799
it might be enough not for you not to be caught in it or drift off in it if you want you could also let go of it

21
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:14,080
at that point recognize your thinking and let go of it every time in the cycle so you only goes

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,000
a couple of seconds between a recognition of thinking and letting go

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,360
there is um it can be quite uh thinking can be in some ways quite clever and camouflaging

24
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,040
itself or that uh or pulling us into its world so we don't

25
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,720
know or recognize that we're thinking and but the clear

26
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,040
recognition oh this i'm thinking again thinking and to do it on such a regular basis

27
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,040
patiently steadily practice coming back to mindfulness

28
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,800
every exhale every exhale and that every exhale

29
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,920
of the moment of mindfulness that kind of clarity um is where the steady slow patient

30
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,800
approach to mindfulness occurs not looking for you know some big experience

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,440
but just looking being content and patient with showing up and waking up to this

32
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,560
here they're thinking so taking a

33
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,000
assuming a comfortable alert posture

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and

35
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,920
relaxing your gaze if you're looking at the screen maybe

36
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,440
looking down and maybe a 45 degree angle and

37
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,640
see if the eyes can be a little bit more at rest

38
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:59,319
and then to gently if it's comfortable for you nice you can gently close your eyes

39
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:10,319
and then to establish a stronger connection to the present moment through your body

40
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,840
taking a few long slow deep breaths

41
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:29,320
deep enough so you feel your rib cages stretch as they expand

42
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,758
or you feel the ballooning out of your belly in that deep exhale

43
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,680
and with a long long inhale and a long exhale

44
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,360
sort of ballooning out ballooning out of the belly as you inhale

45
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,960
and then with the exhale releasing relaxing

46
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,400
softening

47
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,639
letting the breathing return to normal and taking a few moments

48
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,840
in the silence to relax your body

49
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,960
maybe each time you exhale relax some part of your body release the holding

50
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:12,080
and then from within your body as part of your bodily experience

51
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,440
become aware of the body breathing wherever the breathing is

52
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,680
most comfortable for you to experience

53
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,520
or where it's clearest to easiest to connect to

54
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,800
it could be the movements of the belly the movements of the chest the sensations of the air going in and

55
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,280
out through the nostrils or some broad

56
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,840
whole body experience of breathing

57
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:09,360
and as you exhale at the end of the exhale

58
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,800
perhaps you can relax a bit or release a teeny bit more

59
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,720
so there's a slight continuation of the exhale

60
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,160
or perhaps of ever so slight pause before you inhale

61
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,360
and whenever it's time to inhale quietly

62
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,840
attentively receive the inhale

63
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,440
receive the movement sensations of the body as you inhale

64
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:11,638
and as you exhale allow the exhale allow the release

65
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:33,440
and every time you exhale notice if you've been thinking

66
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,839
if you have you might very gently whisper to yourself

67
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,440
thinking as a clear recognition

68
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:59,600
and if it's easy enough to let go of your thoughts during the exhale let them go

69
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,680
so there's a letting go into the quiet and stillness

70
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,440
at the end of the exhale

71
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,920
so you can better receive the inhale

72
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:34,600
and remembering to every exhale recognizing if thinking has returned

73
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:44,320
and if it's easy enough let go of it if it's not easy enough

74
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,720
be ready to recognize that you're thinking again when you exhale next time

75
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,280
perhaps being a little bit more attentive

76
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:33,559
so that you can notice if you've begun thinking on the exhale

77
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,080
and if you're able to let go of your thoughts by the end of the exhale

78
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:51,120
to be attentive to how thoughts begin how they creep in on the inhale

79
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:02,120
and watching this phenomena from a quiet place within

80
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:10,360
unperturbed undisturbed by it but clearly recognizing

81
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:35,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting to appreciate

82
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,799
that if you can recognize that you're thinking

83
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,559
you might recognize the ways you're thinking that are not so

84
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,480
accurate the projections you have on people and

85
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,600
events the interpretations perhaps even the bias

86
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:07,919
and if you're also able to let go of your thoughts or to put them aside enough to see

87
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,279
clearly without the filter of your thinking

88
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:20,640
then it's possible to be present for people

89
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:27,039
to be companions for people be friends with people more fully more

90
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,039
clearly

91
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:41,279
and this is a gift and may it be that our ability to be

92
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:47,039
mindful supports our ability to be friends with

93
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:55,120
others to see them clearly do they have the ability to be present

94
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:02,399
without the pull and the tug of our desires and aversions and

95
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,360
interpretations

96
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:15,000
may it be that this practice that we do

97
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,600
helps us to engage in the world in a kinder friendlier

98
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,200
supportive way and in that way when we dedicate the

99
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:34,639
merit maybe we're more likely

100
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:41,200
to be the conduit in which the merit travels

101
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:48,080
out into the world so whatever benefit and merit we've had

102
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:55,279
from this practice this together may we dedicate it to the welfare and

103
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:03,600
happiness of all beings everywhere may all beings be happy

104
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:12,399
may all beings be safe may all beings

105
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:18,559
be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

106
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,799
be free

107
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,289
[Music]

108
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:39,840
uh so

109
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:51,200
hello and welcome to the continuation of our

110
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,360
little series on patients and

111
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,559
today's topic is another form of patients called patients

112
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:09,440
patience or i call it gentle perseverance

113
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,679
perseverance is just the small little ongoing step by step by step

114
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:21,200
of engagement involvement doing the gentle is to do it without strain

115
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,440
without strife without resistance just kind of the simple steps

116
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,519
go keep going and now in this way it's uh it's sometimes helpful to

117
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:40,240
appreciate that in the buddha's teaching that action

118
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:49,120
was extremely important that he's even his teaching sometimes call is called a teaching of action

119
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:56,480
that means a variety of different things but one of the things that i like to think of it is that it is not a passive

120
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,559
practice even though for a lot of uh modern western practitioners

121
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:08,559
who are over striving overdoing over analyzing over critical of themselves

122
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,840
that the lesson of kind of just letting things be and not doing is such a

123
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,880
powerful and useful medicine but it's the medicine

124
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,039
for the buddha i think that for him that there's an element in which the practice is always

125
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:31,760
an activity of a little bit of a kind of doing but a doing which is an undoing of

126
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,519
stress and strain and tension and criticism and you know

127
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:44,399
striving but it is a kind of doing and uh in sitting in meditation

128
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,840
mindfulness can be experienced as a non-doing just allowing awareness to be there

129
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:57,279
but even that is a very subtle doing because chances are we have to keep coming back to allowing to receiving to

130
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,480
being and that's the doing that's the action and

131
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,880
and so whatever the action there's is a very simple action in practice so today in the meditation i suggested

132
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,399
the action of every time you exhale noticing if you're thinking

133
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:20,720
and if it's easy enough to let go of those thoughts and and so there's always a little bit

134
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,080
something waking up being present being here for the next thing for the next thing

135
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,159
and so there's a little engagement little effort and work that's involved

136
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,640
as we get familiar with mindfulness that work is better often better than the alternative

137
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,960
uh what the mind does and you know the what the spinning often

138
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:52,559
and so this uh amazing capacity we have for gentle perseverance just keep doing the

139
00:33:52,559 --> 00:34:00,240
practice in other walks of life other situations in life sometimes you know perseverance doing it

140
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,640
over and over again being willing to fail and coming back and starting over again can be a huge

141
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,919
strength a huge support for a wise life a good life

142
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:17,440
but so this gentle perseverance is useful in so many areas in life

143
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:24,240
but in practice gentle perseverance not to be looking for the big dramatic

144
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,358
experiences in meditation but being very content and patient with

145
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:35,118
a simple ongoing practice moment by moment just wake showing up

146
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,560
and being mindful of this being present for this here now

147
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,878
and um or in a little bit larger scale i'm meditating every day

148
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:52,000
gentle perseverance of every day no matter what sitting down to meditate

149
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,118
and even if there's nothing more than getting into your meditation posture for a minute

150
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:03,599
every day this gentle perseverance of touching into this wonderful

151
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,880
kind of repository or or

152
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,119
special place where a certain kind of special attention and calm and subtleness

153
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:21,599
can be so this so we keep doing keep doing keep doing

154
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,800
and um and it's uh this gentle perseverance and practice

155
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,838
in the day-to-day ordinary way it's

156
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:38,000
represented or enacted in small little steps as small little things we do

157
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,280
just being a little bit more attentive more present coming back more often

158
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:50,000
and um but small little steps can make huge difference into the future

159
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,079
one of the you know if you take two parallel lines that would they would go parallel on

160
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,520
forever but if you take and nudge one of them little bit to the side

161
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,359
then initially you know just infinitesimal you might not see that they're

162
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:13,520
separating from each other but as you over time the distance between them

163
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,760
becomes greater and greater and greater so if you make sometimes a small change

164
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:27,119
those ends keep up the small change that can over time can make a huge difference for our life and can

165
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,880
transform it in beneficial ways and so this gentle perseverance not giving up

166
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,839
not being discouraged or maybe being discouraged but have the patience to do it anyway just keep

167
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:45,760
showing up to sit to meditate keep showing up to be present for the next moment

168
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,960
and and this very much applies to meditation practice maybe that's the place where

169
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:58,079
it's most um you know it's easiest or the the most

170
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:05,200
kind of the pro the ideal place to practice this gentle perseverance

171
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,720
just keep coming back for the next breath this breath this breath

172
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,000
this breath sometimes we have all these issues and problems and difficult things that

173
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,400
happen in our lives and there's something about the continuity the ballast

174
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,839
of the grounding the sense of of stability that just being with the

175
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:33,920
breath through it all through it all that allows so many things to settle it allows us not to get

176
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,000
wrapped up in other things or be reactive to other things and so not to deny anything

177
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,160
but the gentle perseverance with the breathing with the breathing with the breathing

178
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,440
or the gentle perseverance of being mindful attentive recognizing oh

179
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,800
this is happening this is happening my mind is afraid my mind is afraid

180
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,640
there's fear there's fear and in that little recognition it might be

181
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:09,200
actively even those words in your mind where you follow up the words with just

182
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,240
feeling and sensing what's happening more fully perhaps that in this

183
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:20,720
simple mindfulness you begin finding that you're not wrapped up in it or

184
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:27,520
or caught by it or impacted as fully by the fear or the anxiety or

185
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,640
the desire you know whatever it might be just to keep steady recognizing

186
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:38,000
recognizing that this is what happened this is what's happening and um

187
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,680
and so this gentle perseverance in buddhist practice takes can take many forms

188
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,800
it could be a gentle perseverance of not giving into anger just one one

189
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:57,920
one act of speech after another just okay i'm not going to say it now i'm not going to say this now not now

190
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:05,040
not now and to say i'm not no longer no longer going to be angry no longer say some kind of

191
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,400
um mean things to anyone

192
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,520
ever again when we make these big commitments or big

193
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:21,599
ideas sometimes it's much harder for the mind to cooperate and participate

194
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,440
but sometimes it's the moment and moment steps where we can really it really counts the

195
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,960
most and so um that's not saying that not this not

196
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,400
saying that mean word nope nope nope gentle perseverance

197
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,960
or a strong desire arises and nope nope i'm not giving into that i know what happens this is not healthy for me

198
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,400
or good for others nope nope and a gentle perseverance

199
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,599
uh is just is uh repeating it over and over again until something settles

200
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:01,440
the whole thing shifts and so it's not a big struggle it's not meant to be a big

201
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,040
a wrestling match it's just like because it's so it's just these little steps moment by moment

202
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,920
now now now so um

203
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:21,520
to be patient with the if we're doing things which are useful and healthy and appropriate and

204
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,200
and necessary to persevere

205
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,560
to not resist not procrastinate not

206
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:39,839
give up but just get steady gentle steadiness just showing up showing up and for me i

207
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:47,599
don't know how it is for some of you but this word uh [Music] idea of gentleness

208
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,520
it implies that it doesn't require

209
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,839
heroic effort that will always or strong effort or um it just

210
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:05,680
just move in that direction don't hesitate don't give up

211
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,920
just take a little move in that direction keep doing it keep doing it and

212
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,119
and certainly in buddhist practice and meditation practice

213
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:23,280
probably gentle perseverance carries the day because any other effort that you make

214
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:30,000
probably is agitating probably will not really be sustainable in the

215
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,280
long term but the gentle perseverance it may be a sustainable engaging maybe

216
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,040
becomes self-rewarding and maybe begins to shift that line just

217
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,560
a little bit so that over time it makes a huge difference in your life

218
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:54,560
maybe you don't see it in one day or one week or one month but the gentle perseverance gentle

219
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:00,880
continuity can just doing and doing and doing that can be revolutionary in one's

220
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,480
in one's life so um

221
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,440
so gentle perseverance gentle

222
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:22,800
and the person what we persevere in depends on the context we're in gentle forgiveness gentle kindness

223
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:31,200
compassion just whatever is needed gentle keep doing it so we don't succumb don't

224
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,800
collapse into states of mind and thoughts and ideas which are not really helpful for

225
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:43,599
us and finally i'll say that the alternative sometimes

226
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,960
the continuity the perseverance of distracted thought of

227
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:55,200
of uh aversive thoughts of desirous thoughts of selfish thoughts of

228
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:02,319
thoughts you know victim thoughts the perseverance of those

229
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:09,200
you know they also have an effect over time and slowly and perceptibly the line the

230
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:16,640
parallel lines move within a different direction that may be not so useful so it's very helpful to be careful

231
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:23,520
with what is what what the mind does regularly and continuously because it really has a big effect over

232
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:30,079
time and so once you have a sense of what practice is and what a wise and wholesome way of living

233
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:35,839
is the gentle perseverance gentle step-by-step ordinary step

234
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:42,960
ordinary movement in the direction of what's wholesome and good and

235
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:49,280
and it can be done and it can make a huge difference so thank you

236
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:55,040
very much and and tomorrow we'll do um

237
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:01,680
patience under insult which is a much more difficult one but

238
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,119
it has its uh tremendous benefit so thank you

239
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,000
you
