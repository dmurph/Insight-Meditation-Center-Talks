1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,719
so good morning good day

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:16,560
and um i would like to start with a story

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:26,080
there was a zen teacher who came from japan in the 1960s here in the san francisco bay area

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,640
and uh his name was copencino and

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,079
he was once he was also a apparently a master of

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:46,960
zen archery or the way of archery japanese archery and uh he was invited to eslan

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,920
eslan was a retreat center that is very famous kind of

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,480
for its uh incubating much of the human potential movement of the 1960s and so

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,280
forth and it exists it lives the estlan retreat centers right on the cliffs

10
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:15,040
in big sur south of here overlooking the um pacific ocean it's a magnificent place

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,840
uh the nice lawn front in the front kind of goes right up to the cliff and you see you know

12
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:29,759
vast pacific ocean in front of you so kobencino was invited there to do a

13
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:38,479
archery demonstration and many people came out in the lawn to watch him and he was all set up and

14
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:44,720
and he apparently he was wearing kind of this formal japanese archery

15
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,119
robe or clothes kind of very formal ritualistic looking clothes

16
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,119
and he came up and to where he was going to stand and um

17
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:04,640
and he took a long time to prepare himself and apparently people watching just mesmerized by his care his attention to

18
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,720
detail his his focus his um uh

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,280
and uh in how he prepared and how he got himself in position and it took a long time to take his position and

20
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,520
get himself centered and balanced with his his stance his legs just right and

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,640
and um and then picking up his bow and communing with a bow getting ready with the bow then pulling out an arrow

22
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,239
and uh placing the arrow just right and it was a long process of very much very

23
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,800
very concentrated and uh focused and apparently the way he did it uh people were kind of just

24
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,239
mesmerized kind of came along with him and it was so uh like teeth ceremony some

25
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,519
beautiful ritual and finally he was then spent a lot of

26
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,200
time getting himself just making the aim to really you know

27
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,040
and finally he he released the arrow

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,480
and the arrow flew straight right into the mark

29
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:17,680
and it landed smack in the middle of the pacific ocean that's where he had aimed it for

30
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:25,120
and so this wonderful story that it's not about what he was trying to hit it wasn't about trying to hit something exactly

31
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,959
it was uh all about his presence his attention to the present moment to his body to his details he was fully engaged

32
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,440
in this process and then when he was aiming i mean i mean it was hard to miss the pacific

33
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,840
ocean if you do you know standing on the cliff looking in the general direction but

34
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,400
um he took his task very seriously he was very focused the point was not to

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,519
shoot the arrow and to hit the target the point was to

36
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,879
um um

37
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,840
the point was to really be able to

38
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,720
see to get concentrated in the process the sense of purpose

39
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,799
engagement of what we're doing he's doing so this is what i'd like to suggest for today

40
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:25,120
is that it's the preparation and the sense of concentration purpose of what we're

41
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,919
doing that's important don't worry so much about the results of your practice but really

42
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,680
kind of center yourself here have a strong sense of purpose like here is where you're going to get

43
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,280
into the present moment prepare yourself for it to get everything lined up

44
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,639
kind of aim for the present moment and really be here

45
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,160
and maybe you'll never shoot the arrow that's not the point is

46
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,240
what you're what you're preparing yourself to do it's the way that it puts you into the

47
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,000
activity of being present so

48
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,560
um so

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,520
um so we take a comfortable upright meditation posture

50
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,320
and take time with your posture

51
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,320
it could be that you make some big uh swaying back and forth

52
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,840
it's possible that you just do very small little movements

53
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:47,120
and the point is not to find the right posture the point here is to really be present

54
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,520
in the finding it really feel and sense your body

55
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,160
and feel the the weight of your sitting bones if you're sitting and feel if your

56
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,400
the weight above your torso is balanced comes down balanced way on the sitting bones

57
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,960
not too much on one or the other not projected forward or backwards just

58
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,840
everything lined up

59
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,479
and then with the same kind of care that every little details

60
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:34,000
is precious is tender is done gently carefully

61
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,199
close your eyes and then

62
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:49,840
to prepare yourself take a few long slow deep breaths

63
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,880
breathing in deeply

64
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:04,560
and exhaling and grounding yourself here this place this the body

65
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,880
on your seat place where you're meditating

66
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:16,639
as if you're establishing a balance stability

67
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,199
in the place with the place you're sitting on

68
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,199
that which is holding you up

69
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,680
okay continuing with some somewhat deeper breaths

70
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,319
long exhale relaxing

71
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:58,560
now letting your breathing return to normal and still the preparation of

72
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:07,680
arriving here being ready as you exhale relax your body

73
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,000
relax the face around the eyes

74
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,919
relax the shoulders softening

75
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,640
but not so much to just be completely relaxed but softening relaxing

76
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,880
to really be here in an intentional way to

77
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:48,160
embodied way as if you're preparing your whole body

78
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,519
for a very important task

79
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,480
softening in the chest

80
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,240
relaxing in the belly

81
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,600
and for everything to work together in harmony it's best to

82
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:29,360
let go of any unnecessary tension it could be in the hands and the fingers

83
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,240
of the arms

84
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,880
in the thighs calves and the feet

85
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:03,399
and then without changing anything in your posture to embody your posture more fully

86
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,680
think more of the preparation for engaging in the purpose of

87
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,920
meditation that you invite your whole body along

88
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,880
to participate in this attention presence

89
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,480
the setting up of your attention

90
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,760
and then to

91
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:01,120
prepare to to make the aim like the archer who aimed made it took a

92
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,040
lot of time to prepare and aim and establish that the aim

93
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:14,839
where the arrow was going to go so set your aim and the body breathing

94
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,399
this is the purpose here to really

95
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,160
connect be present for

96
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:34,800
the inhale the exhale

97
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,800
in whatever place in the body where

98
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,480
is the right place for you to put your attention

99
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,519
regarding breathing

100
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,760
maybe where you most enjoy your breathing

101
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,639
maybe where it's clearest

102
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:13,120
and the point here is now it's not to be successful not to accomplish anything

103
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,440
but rather to setting yourself up with the aim

104
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,720
really aiming gently lovingly

105
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,000
the sensations of the body breathing

106
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,639
entering into the sense of purpose and dedication

107
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,040
to be with your breathing

108
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,000
entering into the practice of mindfulness of breathing

109
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,040
with a sense of purpose dedication

110
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,319
we're part of what you're doing when you're meditating

111
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,279
is embodying inhabiting evoking

112
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,720
a sense of purpose this is what you're doing now is just

113
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,319
with quietly breathing

114
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:51,360
with every exhale letting the thinking mind become quieter

115
00:13:51,440 --> 00:14:00,560
so you can really hold the aim on the full extent of the in exhale

116
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:09,480
relaxing present with purpose

117
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,440
if you lose contact with your breathing

118
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,360
it's okay

119
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,640
bring yourself back into the dedication of finding the breath getting centered

120
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:34,520
on the breath aiming at the breath

121
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:44,320
it's not so important that you drift it off it's important that you come back and

122
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:51,520
start again always whenever you can having a purpose

123
00:20:51,520 --> 00:21:00,000
a very valuable purpose of really honing in on breathing

124
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:08,720
quieting the thinking mind relaxing tension

125
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,400
all in the service

126
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,960
of a dedicated attention to breathing

127
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:08,799
and then as we come to the end of the sitting i invite you to experiment

128
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,400
with reorienting yourself with this to us to a sense of purpose

129
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,760
dedication [Music] engagement with the dedication of merit

130
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:28,480
with uh turning our practice around and

131
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,799
wishing well for this world of ours

132
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:40,559
and how would you embody this change of direction in the practice now and

133
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:47,360
give yourself over to a new purpose the purpose of

134
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:56,080
wishing for the welfare of others a kind supportive caring concern for the

135
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,799
welfare of the world

136
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,960
and with this new purpose to enter this purpose for these couple

137
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,640
of minutes may it be

138

that any known and unknown ways that we benefited from this practice

139

may we let those benefits spread from us into the world

140
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:34,240
so that the benefits of this meditation benefit

[Music]

150
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,919
thank you

151
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,679
so hello everyone and

152
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,600
come to the third talk in this five part series i've called it

153
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,039
finding our way and finding our way with these different

154
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,720
um pairs of states that we can experience that

155
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:07,039
sometimes exist in relationship to each other and sometimes can exist independent of each other

156
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,799
sometimes can be a healthy and sometimes can be unhealthy

157
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,880
and today the pairing is that of joy and despair

158
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:26,158
and uh for me the when i think of this the joy that i've

159
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:33,440
kind of been awoken in me through this buddhist practice i think of it as a big yes

160
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:40,000
yes and um even not knowing what i'm saying yes too

161
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,080
i mean i'm not saying yes to anything it's just the idea of yes that something brightens inside of me opens and

162
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:53,440
delights me the joy and that uh in that regard then despair

163
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,960
is just no oh no kind of a

164
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,559
giving up a kind of a deflation a kind of drop in loss of energy

165
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:11,919
sinking um a feeling of maybe hopelessness or great disappointment or great sense of

166
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,840
of um fear of what might come and

167
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,760
and so this yes movement and this no movement um that can

168
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:30,480
exist together a little bit like yesterday the gladness and the sadness that joy can come from

169
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,919
hope and when hope is dashed it can bring a lot

170
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,360
of despair or there is no hope it can bring a lot of despair but

171
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:48,559
but one of the uh my strong association with these two has to do with purpose

172
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:56,559
that um when we have a clear sense of healthy purpose that there can be um a kind of a yes to

173
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:02,960
that the kind of our system our being it gets involved in doing it

174
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,600
and when there's no sense of purpose or the purpose seems hopeless or or is not working out or we can't engage

175
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,880
in it then there can be despair about not fulfilling this purpose that's

176
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:22,399
important for us and the question is what is it what is the purpose we have is it a valuable

177
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,799
healthy purpose there can be joy in the engagement and doing of things

178
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:35,039
which are unhealthy you know you can really fully be immersed

179
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:41,519
in eating only desserts for lunch and for dinner just completely

180
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,799
engaged and the concentration the absorption that

181
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,159
everything else in the world falls away because it's just dessert can be

182
00:33:52,159 --> 00:34:00,240
joyful can be have a feeling of the engagement is so nice but it might not be healthy for you

183
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,799
on the um and there might be things that you know are healthy to do

184
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:13,599
but the way that we engage in it is not healthy we might do it with resentment with reluctance hesitation

185
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:20,638
and and there's uh and we don't really give ourselves over to doing it and so maybe we can't be successful and

186
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,878
they're doing something half-hearted but it's an important thing to do and so we feel despair of something

187
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:33,679
that's healthy that we do so the sense of purpose what do we have a purpose for what's the intention is a

188
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,398
very important part of human life and it's a valuable thing to do in a spiritual life is to spend time

189
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:46,240
reflecting on the purpose the intention the reasons the

190
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,760
the goals in which we have set ourselves up what we're doing

191
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:58,000
and um and this can set up then joy or despair even

192
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,280
wonderful lovely important valuable spiritual dedications or purposes meditation purposes

193
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,680
can bring a lot of despair if we are unsuccessful in doing it we don't reach what we're trying to do

194
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,720
what i'd like to propose is that it's important to spend time reflecting on what our purposes are

195
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:25,200
and whether it's the purpose is just to cook a meal or clean the dishes or the purpose is to

196
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,240
develop or mature spiritually in our buddhist practice

197
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:37,200
these men these motivations purposes are important to become clear about so then we can inhabit the purpose

198
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:44,240
we can really say yes to it and engage and hopefully it's a healthy purpose

199
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,280
and um and some and then have a sense of uh of uh

200
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,359
of um appropriateness of how we attain these uh purposes

201
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:01,280
i mean if you if you sit down to my purpose purposely get enlightened but first you don't even know how to do

202
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,880
breath meditation maybe first you need to learn the basics of breath meditation and learn about the

203
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,720
hindrances and so the purpose there's all these uh

204
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:21,200
earlier purposes we have to inhabit and follow through on before we can attain the full ones so

205
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,800
the sense of purpose i'm talking about here is not an abstract purpose which might be you know some distant one which

206
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,880
might be important for us but rather each step of what we do

207
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,800
how we engage in the moment in the direction of that purpose

208
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:47,440
so if the purpose is to be able to you know develop strong concentration

209
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:54,000
then engage fully for a while understanding your hindrances without really becoming wise about the

210
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,480
hindrances you probably won't get reliably healthfully um concentrated

211
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,280
and so engage in that process study the hindrances and that's the purpose that's what we engage ourselves in

212
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,320
so when we uh despair can come and we don't have a purpose we don't have an

213
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:19,119
engagement and so this idea of of of a joy

214
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,680
and uh and despair which are healthy are founded are based on

215
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,720
a healthy sense of purpose and then learning how to

216
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:37,040
inhabit that purpose in the moment doing in the moment what's appropriate

217
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,400
for that purpose um not sitting there kind of just daydreaming about a big purpose far in

218
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:50,079
the future but if this purpose is important enough what do i enter into and have it do now

219
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:56,400
and so for example if now this idea of concentration and well i need to learn about the

220
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,599
hindrances so maybe the next step is to read about them

221
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:07,599
and so then you would sit down in a way and really purposefully engage you wouldn't read the maybe a

222
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:14,079
book or an article about the hindrances like you would read a novel and just kind of as entertainment and just kind

223
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,359
of be carried along to relax you would do it purposefully engage in

224
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:24,400
it but not in a way that's stressful of course and this is where the art of all

225
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,160
this is but it's a way that brings you joy and there's a yes

226
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,200
there's the art of doing of engaging that brings joy

227
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,119
and not a lot of people have learned this they've learned it in certain areas certain things which are fun to do

228
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,880
they can really enjoy doing that but there is an art to learning how to

229
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:54,400
do anything that you need to do in a joyful way in a way that's a big yes you it's the in doing it it's so

230
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,560
much good if you have to clean the toilet today the more senior monks in the buddhist

231
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,640
monasteries uh in japan it's they're assigned to the task of toilet cleaning

232
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:13,119
and maybe because they have the spiritual maturity to really do it so you have to clean the toilet so maybe

233
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:21,119
you don't like it it's a little bit gross and so you do it like half-heartedly but to do it fully just really in if this is

234
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:28,160
what you're doing this your life energy for this moment just clean the toilet do it as if it's the everything it's the

235
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:34,079
whole just give yourself to yes to doing that what i'm

236
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,000
teaching here today is a lot of what i learned through zen training where if you sweep the courtyard you

237
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,920
really that's what you do you give yourself over to it toilets whatever you're doing you give

238
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,280
yourself to it and the surprise of it is that

239
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,880
it's possible to learn to really feel a sense of joy and delight

240
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,480
and and happiness and just giving ourselves over to it even if you're sick and don't have much

241
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:09,520
energy then you have to keep what is giving yourself over really do something with purpose what does it look like given the

242
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:15,760
conditions of your life if you're sick or in pain whatever the circumstances are the sense

243
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,280
of doing is in harmony with the circumstance with yourself and the world around you

244
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,480
but this is what you're doing you say yes to this

245
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,680
it can be overdone it can be done with stress so you're exhausted at the end

246
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,880
and they can we can learn the art of doing that there's it's we're fully there

247
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:43,440
but we're relaxed and doing so this art of appreciating the value of

248
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,920
what we're actually doing while we're doing it can be a source of tremendous joy

249
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,960
and that kind of joy can grow and part of the despair that people can experience is when they

250
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:03,200
have no sense of purpose when the purpose they had for their life kind of gets shattered

251
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:09,040
and the um or they're unsuccessful on their purpose

252
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:15,599
purpose is very important and so the relationship between purpose and fulfilling a purpose engaging in a

253
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,119
purpose and your joy and despair is something to reflect on and look at

254
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,560
and consider and certainly knowing you're doing something that's wonderfully and

255
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,720
meaningful for you and purposeful can be a source of joy but it's only abstract in the head the

256
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,960
evaluation of it oh i'm doing something wonderful then you're missing where the juice is

257
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:46,400
where the real heart is of this practice of mindfulness and the way it can really grow in us grow for our life

258
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,599
and that is the uh give yourself to

259
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,359
the purpose of the moment give yourself to the whatever

260
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,560
bigger purpose you have if you're pursuing it or engaged in it

261
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:09,200
in the what is the steps in the moment so it i mean just to be maybe make the

262
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,960
point in this silly little example say that the purpose is to

263
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:21,680
your big purpose to get developed concentration in meditation you've heard now that reading about the

264
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:28,160
hindrances and learning about them and understanding them well is a very important stepping stone for concentration

265
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:34,640
so now you but now you don't have a book on the entrances you don't have anything

266
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:41,760
so you go to the library to get one the the town library said hey heaven

267
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:48,160
and so now walking to walking to the library driving to the library biking to the

268
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,760
library that's the task of the moment you forget about going to the library

269
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,760
you can you you set the course to go there and now you give yourself over to the

270
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:07,040
going to the library when you get to the library and this is how it works in the monastery

271
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,880
when you open the library door you give yourself over to opening that door

272
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:20,160
you give yourself walking down the aisles finding the book and so it's the doing

273
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,440
where something really important comes up the purp doing things in a purposeful

274
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,520
way intentional way so that you find joy in it

275
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,720
i'm not suggesting this is easy but it's possible

276
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:43,760
to live a life of yes and if the purpose is valuable and you

277
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,760
find this kind of value and in inhabiting engaging in what you're doing

278
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:56,720
then it doesn't matter if you're successful so much you might fail at things but you're so

279
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:02,720
happy about the way you did it it was rewarding the way you did it was rewarding

280
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:09,760
and if you're successful or not successful your joy happiness and well-being is less dependent eventually

281
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,520
on the success or failure but in how you do it did it how you were

282
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:23,720
involved with what you did so um

283
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:30,480
so for today you know i may be giving you lots to think about and to engage in for the day

284
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:37,119
but to maybe make key points uh reflect on purpose

285
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:45,280
what role does purpose have in your life and have you dismissed the value of purpose can you find a sense of purpose

286
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,520
purpose doesn't have to be big purpose it could be the small purpose of the next five minutes the next hour what's

287
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:58,079
the purpose you have and then the yes of engaging in purpose

288
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,200
in the in the step-by-step ways the small steps it takes whatever

289
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,440
purpose it is not to be ahead of yourself from the activity of the moment the

290
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,359
individual steps to get there and to find how a yes an engagement in

291
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:20,960
the steps to whatever you're doing the purpose that that is purposeful as well

292
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:26,079
finding purpose in how you do things is

293
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,839
one of the great joys and secrets of a well-developed

294
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:37,200
and it'll support your practice your mindfulness practice is a way of of

295
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,319
of manifesting your mindfulness into our life

296
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,599
so i hope you enjoy it i hope you find a delightful day with yes to

297
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:55,079
whatever you're doing and and exploring your sense of purpose thank you
