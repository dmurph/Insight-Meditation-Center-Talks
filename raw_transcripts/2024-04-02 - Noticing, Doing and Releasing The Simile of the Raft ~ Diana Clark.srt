1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:13,360
good evening and welcome welcome everybody it's nice to see you

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,519
all for those of you who don't know me I'm Diana Clark and I'm always often

3
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,400
here on Frid on Fridays wow today's only

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,840
Monday I'm here on Mondays um except when I'm off teaching Retreats or

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:39,160
something then there's substitute teachers and I want to start by uh

6
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,840
talking about this uh simile this analogy that gets used a lot in uh kind

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,840
of in the Buddhist tradition a way to describe practice as a way also as a way

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,760
to describe like this whole path of practice to uh Liberation kind I want to like tease it

9
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:06,240
apart and look at it and see if there's some things that we can learn and like how we can apply it to our own lives

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,840
today and way that we can understand and appreciate some of the maybe some of the

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,560
finer elements here when we sometimes don't think about or aren't so obvious when we talk about this simile in

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,759
particular or also about our practice and I'll start with this notion

13
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,759
of this idea of crossing the floods this is an expression that shows

14
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:37,520
up a number of times in the early Buddhist literature and maybe it's not surprising ancient India right there in

15
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,640
the gangas plains and you know there's this monsoon season and things flood and

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,360
you have to wait till the end of the monsoon season to cross the flood nowadays how many rivers do we

17
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,719
Creeks do we cross and we don't even know it right cuz we're on a freeway or a highway or something but then it was a

18
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:04,399
big deal that you'd be separated from whomever whatever for months at a time

19
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:11,599
simply because you couldn't cross over the water and not only is it like separate

20
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,640
you but if you get caught in the flood like you know you get carried away to

21
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,280
presumably some place you didn't want to go so this flood is something that's

22
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,599
overwhelming it's just like takes you over and you don't have a choice so you

23
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,680
get uh carried away to Downstream

24
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,239
presumably and maybe it's you know even incredibly

25
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:48,519
dangerous so aan suito he's a teacher in this tradition it's a well-respected uh

26
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,599
teacher and he writes about this idea of about crossing the floods and he writes

27
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:00,599
that it's often um there sometimes people come to practice

28
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:07,040
practice because they have this feeling of being overwhelmed and things are a little bit out of control and it's just

29
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,400
too much and it's not going the direction I want so maybe there's this feeling of being in the

30
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:20,720
floods and they wish to be on one of the banks no longer uh being you know

31
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,239
subject to this big body of water that's uh flushing

32
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,640
through this um to this aidea about crossing the flood is then going you

33
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,120
know from getting to where one wants but recognize that it's not going to be so straight forward to get

34
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,680
there and then maybe I'll introduce then the simile that I'd like to spend some

35
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,360
time unpacking today and this is called the simile of the raft it's very common

36
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:57,239
it's shows up a number of times in the sued teachings and sometimes uh sometimes even like people say well you

37
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,319
know the raft they'll as a shortcut kind of like you know some people today might

38
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:08,560
say well you know the turtle and the hair and that's all you have to say they like know the whole story the one's

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,959
faster than the other and not the one that you think is going to be faster in the same way sometimes this idea of the

40
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,079
raft so here's the simile and then um I'd like to talk about it so this is the

41
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:27,759
Buddha speaking and he says imagine a person in the course of a

42
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:34,680
journey arrives at a great expanse of water some translators use the word

43
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:42,880
flood whose near shore is dangerous and whose far Shore offers

44
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,919
safety but there's no fairy booat or bridge to take them across the

45
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,880
water so the person thinks what if I collect grass and twigs and branches and

46
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,919
leaves and bound them together and create a raft and then supported by the raft and

47
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:07,680
by paddling with my hands and feet I should then be able to reach the far Shore get across the

48
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:15,240
flood so then the person does this and succeeds in getting it across to the far shore on arriving at the far Shore it

49
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,639
might occur to them wow this wow I added that that's not suit

50
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:29,720
us this raft has been very helpful what if I were to hoist it on my head or Lord

51
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,039
load it on my shoulders and proceed on my journey so this idea like okay this ra is really helpful I better carry it

52
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:43,680
with me everywhere I go and then the Buddha says now what do you think by carrying it with them would

53
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,440
that person be doing what should be done with a raft and the people are listening say no

54
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,479
venerable sir they so then the Buddha ask so what should the person what

55
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,360
should the person do with the raft and then

56
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,599
the Buddhist says having arrived at the far Shore the person might think yes

57
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:15,759
this raft has been very useful but now I should just haul it onto dry

58
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:23,960
land or release it and set it a drift in the water and then go wherever I

59
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,800
want in this way the person would be doing what should be done with that raft

60
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:39,120
so there's a lot of little stories in here that we can empties apart about this and so first of all this is uh some

61
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,160
of these different elements is it starts with imagine a person in the course of a

62
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,479
journey arrives at a great expense of water whose Nearshore is dangerous and

63
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:59,080
whose far Shore is Safety First is just to notice the near shore is dangerous and this word

64
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:06,800
dangerous we could use as a simile or as a to stand in for it's not a refuge it's

65
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,639
not a place that will uh can provide some lasting happiness or lasting safety

66
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:20,000
or lasting ease instead it's going to be difficult

67
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,759
and and some of uh you might have even noticed this during this 30 minute sit

68
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:32,440
there's often this sense like okay I'm going to sit I'm going to meditate and then what

69
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,520
happens right I think uh all of our minds like human Minds have this idea

70
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,280
that uh maybe there's you notice that the mind starts to wander and uh maybe

71
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,319
it's um thinking about things that you're planning that you need to take care of or maybe there's a memory that

72
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,919
arises or maybe there's a fantasy about something that doesn't even exist yet or

73
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:03,560
you're rehearsing a conversation that'll happen in the future and they're like oh right I'm supposed to be meditating this

74
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:11,639
idea like you know okay come back to the meditation for many people it's having mindfulness of the sensations of

75
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:17,000
breathing but it doesn't take long with a meditation practice for us to be

76
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,400
reminded or aware of we don't control the mind we don't of course we don't if we

77
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,680
did you wouldn't need a meditation practice so there's this sense of like

78
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,719
we don't control where the Mind goes we can't only think happy thoughts we can't

79
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,919
only be like focused exactly when we want to be and be uh relaxed when we

80
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:46,160
want to be it doesn't work that way and so that's part of like this near shore

81
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,000
being dangerous is that the mind right can get us into all kinds of trouble to

82
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,920
be sure it also can supply all kinds of beautiful fantastic experiences

83
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,279
meaningful experiences and can support us on our path but we don't control it

84
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:10,959
in the way that we think we might and certainly with practice there's a neuroplasticity right so the

85
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,480
mind just starts to become more and more capable and used to and gets into the

86
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,240
groove of settling down and meditating but it doesn't mean that we can when we're not meditating for example we're

87
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:31,200
only thinking certain thoughts of course not it doesn't happen I will say with practice though the thoughts start to be

88
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,000
less problematic it stops to be less uh of an

89
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,200
issue but this idea that we don't control them as part of recognizing okay

90
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,839
this far Shore or sorry this near shore isn't a permanent

91
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:55,440
Refuge but it's not only that it's that

92
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:02,680
uh there might be this simple activities that we're doing doing that we don't maybe give a second thought to have a

93
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:08,480
certain amount of dissatisfaction a certain amount of

94
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,720
stress or unease or things just not being quite right or just feeling

95
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,839
downright bad there's this um another assimile

96
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,519
I'll shove in a assimile inside this other assimile that uh that Buddha gives

97
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:32,000
about doing something that would have been an ordinary thing for people getting in Ancient Ancient India to do

98
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and that is right if they needed light light back then of course was associated with a flame of course and so

99
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,880
the Buddha he gives this uh simile suppose a person took a blazing

100
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:52,320
grass torch and went against the wind so it's one thing to be lighting your way

101
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,839
but what if the wind is coming this way what do you think if that person

102
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,399
does not quickly like go of that blazing grass torch wouldn't that blazing grass

103
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:10,839
torch burn their hand or their arm or some other part of the body so that they might incur death or deadly suffering

104
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:17,160
because of that so this is just an ordinary thing just having to pay attention like okay

105
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:23,680
if you hold something that's on fire and that's windy chances are you're going to get

106
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:31,880
burned so too so the Buddha says an a practitioner considers sensual

107
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,399
Pleasures have been compared to a grass torch they provide great disappointment and great trouble while the danger in

108
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:45,880
them is great so he's saying this some things that we might do might hook us

109
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,000
and we might just be always looking for these Pleasures this addiction to

110
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,320
comfort or this idea that we have to have um everything has to be pleasurable all the time it's not helpful some

111
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,839
examples of this might be that if you notice how you feel like after you've

112
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:10,760
been like watching too many videos on the internet there's this way

113
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:17,320
that it's like this icky feeling afterwards you feel drained and the brain is uh at least this happens to me

114
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:24,440
for those times I've done this I feel like oh my gosh was awful I have a headache and I feel like either what I

115
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:31,000
was watching was uh makes me feel bad because what's happening there or bad about myself because I my life doesn't

116
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
look like their life right of course this type of thing so there's a way in which some of

117
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,399
these things that we think that they're pleasurable actually turn out not to be pleasurable in the big

118
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,680
picture so the Buddha is pointing to just noticing some of the difficulties

119
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:57,000
that are here in on this Shore but then the simile continues and

120
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,040
it says a person arrives at a great expense of water whose near shore is

121
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,160
dangerous but there's no and the farshore offers safety but there's no

122
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:16,800
ferry boat or bridge to take them across the water just this recognition oh yeah we

123
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,120
want an easy way we want to have to not even get out of our cars just drive over

124
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:28,440
we don't get wet we don't even notice but that's not possible for what's being

125
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,680
pointed to here of course we want river boats and

126
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:41,279
fairies and bridges and something that these things uh imply is that somebody else has done

127
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:49,000
the work to create them and that maybe we kind of secretly wishing somehow that somebody else will

128
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,040
do the hard labor and we can just benefit from it and in some way I mean the Buddha did

129
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:02,880
do some hard labor and we are about fting from it but uh he says very

130
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,120
clearly that he shows the way but we have to do the

131
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,680
walking and so this path of practice we actually have to find our way like we

132
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,279
know where to go we can see where we have to go on the other Shore there and we have to figure out how are

133
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:28,519
we going to do this how are we going to get there so in the simbly says well the

134
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:34,680
person said says um what if I collected grass Twigs branches and leaves and

135
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:41,519
bound them together as a raft I love this this grass Twigs branches and

136
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,800
leaves that's just what's right here like this person he's standing on the

137
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:55,120
banks and that's what's right there he doesn't have to go searching for something specific he doesn't have to I

138
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:02,279
don't know go contact a Potter and have them make some something or you know it's just nature it's just right here

139
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:10,320
what's happening and that's true for us also we don't have to wait for just the

140
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,839
right moment just the right conditions we can work on finding our

141
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:23,680
way to Greater freedom and ease peace Liberation working with exactly what's

142
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:30,800
happening right now at this moment feel UNC comfortable your mind is

143
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,279
racing feeling very happy have a lot of ease whatever is happening we can work

144
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:43,800
with that and be part of our practice we there's a number of ways and

145
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:52,000
that would be a whole Dharma talk like how we can do this here but maybe one way is to not uh get tangled up in them

146
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,519
not get tangled up in this uh these leaves they should be bigger if they were bigger then would be better for or

147
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:06,399
the grass should be longer you know to recognize how we are always trying to

148
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,440
make things be different we have so much resistance to what's actually

149
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:21,079
here and instead to put down the resistance and just to work with what's here and it's the putting down the

150
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:26,279
resistance and paying attention to what's actually here is how the raft

151
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:32,199
gets built this is that what car carries us across

152
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:38,800
really and so this simil continues it says supported by the raft

153
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:47,160
and by paddling with my hands and feet I should then be able to reach the far Shore so I I like this idea like

154
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,920
supported by the raft and paddling with my hands and feet so still having to do

155
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,040
effort even though it made a raft it doesn't mean that like it's just a

156
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:03,440
downhill from there on or you know smooth sailing but this idea of creating

157
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,720
the conditions in which maybe we could do something that we couldn't do before

158
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:17,480
now we can do some paddling where before all we could do was walking or something like this and so much of our practice is um

159
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:25,959
increasing our capacities our capacities to be with discomfort our capacities to be present

160
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:31,760
for ourselves to honor and respect our ourselves to honor and respect

161
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,280
others and when these things start to happen this honor and respect and

162
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:44,080
capability of being just uncomfortable then things unfold in a different way

163
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,720
they unfold with greater ease they unfold with

164
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:56,120
a more I'm going to use this word

165
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,960
ease without us trying to like you know manufacturer and no I don't want this

166
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,000
trying to make sure it doesn't go that way or something and we're blaming and

167
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,240
criticizing and getting angry and upset and but instead like no okay I have

168
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,480
grass leaves twigs and branches this is what I'm going to work with going to

169
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,919
work with them and create a raft that's then going to help me move to the other

170
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:30,280
side and then you know I stop to paddle when I get there and I I love this idea

171
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:37,960
of kind like paddling with hands and feet yeah with what you have maybe everybody doesn't have use of

172
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,159
all their hands or both of their feet but you work with what you have I think that's what's being pointed

173
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:51,840
to here so there's this also this we're having

174
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:59,440
to notice that the other bank is not dangerous like this wish to want to go there in the first place

175
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,880
and this requires that we have a sense of oh yeah less difficulties less

176
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:12,159
suffering less stress less dissatisfaction is

177
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:18,880
possible we have to have that sense it is possible otherwise why would we

178
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:26,679
bother and chances are all of us know this because we touch into it

179
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:33,960
sometimes maybe as part of medit ation practice maybe there's just times in our life when we have a certain

180
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,919
ease hiking with the redwood trees sitting at the beach waking up

181
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:47,120
from a fantastic nap where you feel really refreshed having loved ones nearby

182
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,400
grandkids kids siblings parents whatever it might be whomever it might be there

183
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,840
might be this time that we recognize oh yeah it is possible to have some more

184
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:06,039
ease and some spaciousness they to be willing to do

185
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:11,400
this part of the problem is is humans have a negativity bias and we tend to

186
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:18,360
like when there's a pleasant experience some openness and spaciousness and I'm defining Pleasant

187
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:25,520
in this way of like you know ease not necessarily eat having um non-stop

188
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:34,000
chocolate ice cream for example or something like this but more just having some it's like some radical contentment

189
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,159
like yeah yeah it's okay and often we tend to dismiss these

190
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:48,159
moments because we're looking for the big bang you know Wahoo roller coaster

191
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:55,679
type of experiences thinking that's really what happiness is fireworks and celebrations and cake and ice cream you

192
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:02,400
know these types of things those are great too but the truth is most of our Lives we do

193
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,679
have moments where it's okay maybe we finish doing the dishes and the

194
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:14,679
kitchen's all clean and it looks very nice and maybe that's just a moment it feels

195
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:23,120
feels good like oh okay so this recognition that it is

196
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:30,240
possible and that's possible for you for me for all of us and that there's way

197
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,600
that we can find our way where that's more and more of our experience instead

198
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,880
of something that you know some person did thousands of years ago and oh isn't

199
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,240
that cute instead like oh no this is something for all of

200
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,799
us and so this far Shore it can for um

201
00:21:52,799 --> 00:22:00,960
sometimes we think of it or sometimes drama teachers will talk about it as neana but it can just simply be a

202
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,720
refuge a place where we feel like we can rest you know this kind of a sense of

203
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:14,279
where we can relax it is possible to not have so much

204
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:17,960
uh dooka of course it

205
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,240
is and so maybe returning back to this idea of

206
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:31,440
effort there's this two types of effort one one is like cultivating the raft

207
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,000
creating making the raft developing and the other is employing the raft using

208
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,480
the raft and we might think about that you know these different ways of doing that

209
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,679
uh practice asks of us this cultivation as well as things like

210
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:57,720
reflection or meditation or ethical Behavior you know things that

211
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:04,480
we're doing in our daily lives

212
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,440
so there's this um then when the person on this assimile

213
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:18,279
when it goes back when they uh when he gets to the far Shore he has this the Buddha asks this inquiry whether to

214
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:25,760
carry the raft or to leave it behind like I'm getting my notes my page number

215
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,600
is a little mixed up here but um this idea that once you get to the far

216
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:39,120
Shore so this question is well this raft was so handy should I carry it on my head or put it on my

217
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:47,520
shoulders and I think the important thing here is this little simile or this little note that's in the simile is well

218
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,440
to either bring it on dry land maybe you know that there might be some rivers or

219
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,080
Creeks or floods to cross and maybe you don't need at that moment but or maybe you can

220
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:05,440
uh come back for it later or maybe you send it down the flood because it's just

221
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,799
leaves and Creek uh twigs and branches anyway so just let it

222
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:18,679
go but at the end of this assimile he says just let it go and then go wherever

223
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:27,159
I want so this the freedom that's available if we are able to let go of

224
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:33,760
even things that at one time time we helpful doesn't mean that it will always be

225
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,880
helpful and to recognize okay what is helpful and when is the time to use

226
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:48,640
these things and when is it not the time and um this week I'm teaching the 7

227
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,760
am I'm substitute teaching for a Gill and I'm doing a theme on the inner

228
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:00,200
critic and there's something about the inner critic is you know the inner critic maybe there was a time in which

229
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,840
it was helpful to uh kind of give ourselves a little pep talk like no you

230
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:12,279
didn't do that right you can do this or or maybe we internalize something that we heard when we were young but the

231
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:19,600
inner critic is often not always but is often something that we drag with us into our adult life from the our when we

232
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:26,600
were really young so in this way some of the things that we learned some of the messages

233
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:32,880
that we heard or you know what maybe at one point were helpful and maybe this inner critic is

234
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,799
just trying to protect us from what it perceive something that will be really

235
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,039
terrible but we can think of it as okay maybe it's time to put that down in the

236
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:49,559
same way that we would put this raft down and no longer be something that we

237
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:57,760
would carry with us so this assembly of the raft this

238
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,240
idea of uh being on the near shore flood of water wanting to get to the far Shore

239
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,919
because there's safety there then building a raft with whatever

240
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:15,559
one finds using that raft and putting forth some effort to get to the far

241
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:24,039
Shore and then when there putting the raft down so we might summarize this as in a

242
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:29,240
way of practice I mean the way the simile Goes The Story Goes it's a linear

243
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:36,080
but we might summarize it in a way that's not necessarily linear but as

244
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:42,960
noticing doing releasing so kind of three different

245
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,679
aspects of practice towards a greater Freedom noticing just noticing and being

246
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:57,039
present for our life so often we're disconnected and distracted and maybe we're disconnected

247
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:05,600
from ourselves disconnected from others but kind of like just noticing what's happening and noticing what's helpful

248
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,760
and what's not helpful what brings more ease and what doesn't bring more

249
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:19,120
ease noticing is there a way that we're showing up in the world that's causing harm for ourselves or for others just

250
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:25,840
being sensitive to this tuning into this and then

251
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:33,360
doing you know sometimes in the buddist teachers we talk about you know don't do and sometimes we talk about do so it's a

252
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,840
little bit of both right but this idea of like cultivating that's why we have a

253
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:44,960
meditation practice is to like cultivate a wholesome helpful mental States so

254
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,039
that they can support us in our life and they can help us abandon these things

255
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:56,960
that are not so helpful the inner critic would be an example like this so just abandon this

256
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:05,440
turns out not to be hopeful instead it tends to discourage us and deflate us and demoralize us in a way

257
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,880
that gets in the way of our showing up the best way we can or for us to have the best life we

258
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:19,960
can so this caring is or the I'm sorry the

259
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,960
doing maybe this La the raft uh maybe we do something and is and maybe part of it

260
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:32,440
is bringing the raft on sure and thinking like okay this was I learned how to build this and it's going to be

261
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,640
useful I don't need it right now but maybe it's will be useful

262
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:44,679
later and then releasing the raft is Left Behind at

263
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:50,760
that moment here in this simile this practice is not about

264
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:56,159
getting and attaining and having more and more and more it turns out the way

265
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:03,360
forward is releasing opening and that just means that

266
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,799
sometimes that um in order to let go to release there has to be some

267
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:15,960
cultivation there's a things it's so much easier to let go or soften if

268
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,480
there's a certain amount of wellbeing we all know this that when

269
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:28,799
we're happier it's easier to like oh okay that's not a problem that uh you know lost that I don't know where my

270
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:34,000
sunglasses are it's not a good thing nobody likes to lose things but if the

271
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,320
if losing one's sunglasses happens on top of so many terrible things that

272
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,600
happen that day and already a bad mood right that's very different than like okay woke up from that nice snap and you

273
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:53,000
want to go for a hike and like okay I don't have my sunglasses I guess I'll just wear a hat you know something like

274
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,559
this so part of the cultivating this doing part is to to have a sense of

275
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:08,799
well-being have a sense of like nourishing our inner life there's a way in which so

276
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:15,880
often there's a way in which we are so hungry or feel like we're starving and

277
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:21,799
just not enough uh inside and so part of this practice that

278
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:29,679
doing is for the nourishing makes it easier and easier to release and I could say part of the

279
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,799
nourishing is releasing some of the things that maybe we are taking in that

280
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:41,159
aren't nourishing but we're spending our time filling our minds and our lives

281
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:48,000
with these things that aren't supportive maybe that's part of the releasing too is you know okay this isn't helpful this

282
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,398
is uh I thought it was helpful when I started but it's no longer is or something like

283
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:02,440
this so noticing doing and

284
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:10,039
releasing as maybe three different aspects of practice that they are all intertwined and sometimes it's helpful

285
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:16,600
to tease apart these different elements and sometimes it's not so helpful but this idea of you know to

286
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:22,120
help us get across these floods these things that overwhelm us

287
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:29,480
and they feel like H it's just too much we feel like we're getting maybe submerged and and whatever life is

288
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:36,480
bringing us simile of the raft as noticing doing

289
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,760
and releasing not necessarily in that

290
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:49,799
order and now I think I'd like to open it up to see if there's some questions or

291
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,840
comments

292
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:14,840
this idea of paddling with one's feet hands and

293
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:20,279
feet you guys have an idea like what would be a modern day

294
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:25,320
uh like a what would if like how would could we interpret that if we're not

295
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,919
going across the raft across for not using the raft

296
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:38,039
across the flood Diana I something that came up for

297
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:46,080
me as you talking about the raft was uh I had a relationship to it with trust or

298
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,919
confidence that it keeps you boyed above you know not sinking into the water that

299
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,960
that that there's some some element of support um associated with that

300
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:04,360
fantastic fantastic do you know that uh ton and Gil and I have um we teach this

301
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:10,760
teaching it's called raft practice R A ft and sometimes the t is trust the same

302
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:18,279
idea that you know this confidence that it can keep you uh AF flat some kind of way but did you want to say more about

303
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:25,559
that Jim uh no no I like this I like this how partly

304
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:32,080
you know building the ra kind of cultivating things is does give us confidence certainly like you like okay

305
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,440
I can handle this in the past I wouldn't have been able to or maybe maybe the

306
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:45,200
confidence that uh that we can um maybe if we don't handle it perfectly but that we can recover like oh okay I don't have

307
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:52,279
to beat myself up so badly as I had in the past or something like this thank you thank you Jim was did I see a

308
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:59,039
question over here where did you have one question can you put the microphone over there

309
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:07,159
thank you Scott so this raft building um I was

310
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:14,240
thinking about it in terms of my own life and one of the issues is that

311
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:20,919
um uh the near near shore of this uh water

312
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:26,440
is dangerous but I have no idea what the other Shore is so in the simil it said

313
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:33,638
it was safe but I me maybe maybe somehow the ref Builder knew that it was saved but I never know I keep on building refs

314
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:39,839
but I don't know whether the other Shore is safe is that an issue that the Buddha

315
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:46,158
addressed that we really don't know no in this he is saying you know

316
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,560
it's a simile to talk about like getting to safety but your point is a valid one

317
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:58,160
like okay we don't absolutely know what's on the other side of the flood but sometimes we don't have a choice but

318
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:04,839
sometimes life brings us okay where we were standing just doesn't exist anymore for you whatever reason our things in

319
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:11,240
our life change and you know that just the Nearshore changes and we have to we

320
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:17,960
have to go forward in some kind of way whether we know it's safe or not

321
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:24,119
right yeah yeah I think I think we would all like to have some reassurance but uh

322
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:30,000
it's not always there of course yeah thank you and then I think over here right you did

323
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,920
you have a I

324
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,839
was I came here today I haven't been here in a couple of years and

325
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:49,760
um I just found that I had some can you hold the microphone just a little bit closer I had some empty time in my life

326
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:58,280
for the first time first evening in a about a couple of months and it felt empty you know it

327
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,960
just felt empty and I felt right about coming here uh but while I was meditating of

328
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,640
course I was rerunning scenarios with my

329
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:17,319
family and um so not knowing what the

330
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:25,240
other well basically trying to fix it how am I going to fix it and so I

331
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:34,079
started thinking about the raft and um paddling like sometimes paddling for

332
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:42,319
me is just making a phone call to somebody to say what's on my mind so

333
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:50,240
they I can get feedback because I'm not always thinking correctly and um but then there are

334
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:56,839
other times when I'm just I keep keep Gathering grass and sticks and whatever

335
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:01,960
you know you can pile a lot of stuff on you can go to therapy then you can go on

336
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:10,359
the internet there's a million people telling you what you should at least a million at least a million right and um

337
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:17,520
more vitamins more this you know and and the idea of releasing today was so

338
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,520
helpful for me of realizing that you know if you go

339
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,040
to therapy you don't have to go for the rest of your life you know or if you

340
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:36,280
have a relationship it doesn't have to be the rest of your life the way you don't have to behave the same way all

341
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:43,079
the time that's right and trying to approach my daughter in a different way

342
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:48,200
is it's a it's a little scary you know yeah because both of us are going to

343
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,440
have different reactions but um

344
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:01,000
it's I'm having trust that it's going to be okay either way nice you know either

345
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,880
way thank you very much you're welcome you're welcome and you also don't have reassurance I mean we don't you don't

346
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:14,280
know exactly what's going to happen but you're going to I don't really need it you know if I if I really am releasing I

347
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,680
don't really need it that's right that's right thank you anybody else has comments or guests

348
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,119
back

349
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:34,040
there thank you um I really enjoyed got a lot

350
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,079
out of that talk for me um the

351
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:44,839
noticing that I'm in a spot um that maybe isn't the

352
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:53,400
healthiest is kind of the easy part relatively speaking for me the doing

353
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:02,480
um like what to do uh is where I find a difficulty um

354
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:09,480
and you know looking at it with the uh you know you're at the shore and there's water and you got to get across okay

355
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,839
that's I know what to do but um in my

356
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:20,800
situation a lot of times I don't know what to do and wondering if you had any

357
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,640
thoughts on that I can say something general of course right I guess that's the one

358
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:34,839
thing I can say here here I'll start with something that's obvious well if you will never regret never

359
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:41,359
regret and it will always support you if you follow the five precepts so behave

360
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:47,440
in an ethical way so this is something that will always be a support for you

361
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:53,720
doesn't mean it will always be the easiest it doesn't mean it will always be comfortable but that's uh sometimes

362
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,920
when our life is really in disarray and we don't know what to do like sometimes

363
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:05,400
that's uh I've heard a dma teacher give this uh advice to somebody else who was

364
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,480
really have her in a tumultuous period of her life and that the um advice was

365
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:17,599
hold on to the precepts as if they are a raft that are carrying you across so

366
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:24,400
that's one thing I can offer is we'll never have a regret with that and then

367
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,520
you know the eight-fold path if you're familiar with that that can read really help to this idea of like right effort

368
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:37,440
is paying attention like okay what's helpful what's not helpful and just noticing that sometimes just saying okay

369
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,319
I'm going to notice what when I do this does it is it helpful or is it not and

370
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:51,760
really like intentionally investigate that I guess maybe so thank you you're welcome you're

371
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:01,440
welcome anybody else have uh something anything they'd like to say or

372
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,119
comment okay so wishing you a lovely rest of the evening and may your rafts

373
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:18,079
float beautifully thank you
