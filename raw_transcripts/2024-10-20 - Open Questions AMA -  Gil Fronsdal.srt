1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:10,200
so normally when I come here on Sunday morning I give a Dharma talk and part of

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,359
the purpose of giving a Dharma talk is somehow to convey the

3
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:23,160
Dharma and if I don't have a Dharma talk on my heart if I give a Dharma talk

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,679
anyway then I'm probably not going to convey the Dharma Dharma talk shouldn't be forced

5
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,840
or be contrived or be and um and

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:42,079
so uh I think that the better way of conveying the Dharma today is uh just

7
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:49,199
tell you I don't have a Dharma talk and to um use this time for your

8
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:55,800
questions and I'm happy to try to respond the best I can and maybe in those wonderful exchanges that the

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:03,039
Dharma will be born here at IMC so um do any any of you have anything

10
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:10,119
you'd like to ask or topic or something then we can take some time to

11
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:14,679
you think about it you weren't prepared for this

12
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,600
what do you personally think happens when we

13
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:52,159
die yes so so I personally believe that um if the dying goes

14
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:59,520
well to you know it's not too sudden or not too much too much pain or mental

15
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,680
kind of chemistry changes that if it goes well that that

16
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,040
process is very much like the process of Letting Go in very deep meditation and

17
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:18,160
in very deep meditation that process of letting go is so good it's like some of the very best things that can happen to

18
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,120
a person the greatest happiness the greatest peace the greatest meaning it just gets better and better the deeper

19
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,720
the letting go is and so I look forward to dying I look forward to that process

20
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,599
of dying if I'm lucky enough for it to be you know a good death because I have a strong very strong Association that

21
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:46,239
it'll just be this process that I already know and it just gets better the more you let go so so it's just I look

22
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:54,280
forward to that process and I don't know what that I don't know what happens at the you know the final letting go but

23
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,599
the F it has to be good does that answer your question well

24
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:07,480
enough yes yes so I have been reading the Tibetan Book of the Dead and as you know

25
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,560
they're they they believe in reincarnation and the BAU is the time

26
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:21,040
between when you die and when you get your new life if you do get a new life um I'm sure you're aware of this

27
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,519
book and uh I mean what are your thoughts on that because it's it's the book itself is kind of complicated to

28
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,159
read it's kind of what complic ated oh I see they talk about all these deities

29
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:40,080
and all these you know demons and and the light is really bright and shining in your eyes so

30
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:47,159
it's yes so uh uh well the title of the book says a lot for me because it's it's

31
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:54,400
a Tibetan book of of dying living and dying and um the um we're not in the

32
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,159
Tibetan tradition here and uh we're in the terad Buddhist tradition and and in

33
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:07,920
in the inside the terad tradition we're much more rooted in the earliest part of that tradition uh in you know the

34
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,879
earliest teachings of the recorded recorded teachings of the Buddha and so uh we don't share the same

35
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,840
world viiew as the Tibetans and so we don't share the idea there's a BAU period we don't share the

36
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:29,360
same cosmology of the that they have and the same relationship to it so um you

37
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,800
know I I wish them well and with their worldview we have a different worldview

38
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,440
but I I do have a uh several uh colleagues from Burma who are very

39
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:49,199
devout Buddhists and they very firmly believe in reincarnation I don't know about yeah yeah the other Realms or what

40
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,840
have you but they do firmly believe in reincarnation generally generally this is a minor maybe semantic issue uh

41
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,120
generally in Buddhism we don't use the word reincarnation is sometimes used in tibetan Buddhist circles in English but

42
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,199
uh we tend to in our T Traditions usually rebirth has a little different

43
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,440
connotation and um and it's true most Buddhists believe in

44
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,680
rebirth but they don't believe but terad don't believe in the Bardo it the people who believe in

45
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,240
rebirth in terad and Buddhism see it as kind of an instant process you die and

46
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,638
then move on to the next round

47
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,720
oh thank you okay thank you hello

48
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,840
um I turn it off

49
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,560
okay what's your name my name is Pearson hi yeah good to meet you um I had a

50
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:58,400
question about um kind of like the origins of fear and anxiety um specifically when it comes to

51
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,759
like things that that you logically understand are not a real threat to you but like right now my my blood is

52
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,400
pumping faster I feel like a pressure social pressure where does that come

53
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,039
from how do you kind of start to feel comfortable dealing with it yeah

54
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:24,280
wonderful I love the question thank you and uh yeah so uh fear anxiety distress

55
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,759
anger all kinds of emotions like that I I kind of like to understand them as to

56
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,400
the perceivable response to the world we live in or the imagination which we live

57
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,919
in and um and what we want to do in this practice is not stop at the

58
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:47,680
perceivable and we want to be careful not to give a lot of authority to the perceivable emotions we have and or to

59
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:55,360
be invested in them or to identify with them and at the same time we don't want to disrespect them and so to not

60
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,440
identify with them not assign a lot of meaning meaning and

61
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,639
value to them and and to repeat the importance of it to respect them um and

62
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:15,479
then to doing so to begin discovering uh the less perceivable Source within of

63
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:21,840
where they come from and and it's in particular that they come from they have

64
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:30,240
the the where they come from uh as often there is a place inside where it uh we

65
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:38,800
have a a Caring Heart we have a place of care of of uh caring for ourselves

66
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,680
caring for the world a capacity for love and compassion capacity for goodness

67
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,800
that often is not so perceivable especially if we have these strong emotions on the

68
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,159
surface and so uh so for

69
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:04,919
you what sense what experience do you have of that less perceivable Source in

70
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:13,280
you what's my experience of the less perceivable yeah that's underneath all those emotions you're asking about I

71
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,560
mean um I mean it's like a desire to connect and feel comfortable I think at

72
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:26,280
the end of the day I think that's fantastic and then if you take one step further that desire to be connected and

73
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,440
feel comfortable what has to be there before that

74
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,240
yeah I mean I think I'm still rooted too fast in know and like trying to escape

75
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,040
the pain that I don't know where the origin of it it comes from oh so but

76
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:00,480
then that was a great answer so underneath this desire to be comfortable and connected there is some pain

77
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,040
so we would hold that pain like this so we would go through from the perceivable

78
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,279
and we would that that's a that's a profound from in our point of view it's a very profound answer you provided so

79
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:18,800
then that that pain uh probably needs your care your

80
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:28,360
attention and what part of you can offer that care to to your pain

81
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:40,200
and it's maybe not a what question but I like I like very much how you've been work wording this so maybe I say where

82
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,480
in you from where within you can you offer care to your own

83
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:56,200
pain not to be corny but from my heart I mean I guess from the center I don't know from the origin right where it came

84
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,839
from uhhuh before I was in pain I guess I don't know wonderful so so from my

85
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:09,240
point of view these are profound answers you provided for your own question and so that's that's you you know that's the

86
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:16,000
wear that you're asking about what's underneath it all and that's where we in this practice that's where we're going

87
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,360
to rest there and to trust there and allow something to new to

88
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,560
emerge uh in that care to the depths within us that cannot emerge if we're

89
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,040
giving a lot of authority identification to these perceivable

90
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,200
emotions thank you thank you I hope it was okay to do this with you ask these questions yeah absolutely I appreciate

91
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,880
it thank you thank

92
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:55,720
you I guess yeah so I have a question about

93
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,160
um working with pleasures of the flesh and developing a relationship to

94
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:09,880
Pleasures that aren't of the flesh so I'm wondering if you could address that a little bit and maybe refer it to some

95
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:16,920
pudas Etc so he's asking a question that comes from the ancient language um so

96
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:23,480
little contextualize that the Buddha distinguished um the honic experiences

97
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,079
we can have a Pleasure and Pain into two categories and uh the most common way

98
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:37,120
that this is translated into English is um is uh spiritual and worldly but it

99
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:44,800
turns out that the literal uh wording that the Buddha used was of the Flesh and not of the flesh but that kind of

100
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,560
doesn't quite speak to something profound for many people in the west so

101
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,399
there are uh surface Pleasures that we can have that are worldly in the sense

102
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,000
that they have to do with um something in the world World pleasing our senses

103
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,440
so it could be as simple as going out and feeling the sunlight in a cold day and feeling the warmth and feeling the

104
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,120
pleasure it could be eating nice food and not only feeling the pleasure of the

105
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,440
tasty sweet food or something but uh if uh you're with

106
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,639
someone who says you know is caring for you you're distressed and Afraid or

107
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:31,959
something and you're cold and they said come with me my friend let's go stand and the sun together now there's another

108
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:38,560
pleasure that's there that's not just the pleasure of the sun warming you up but it's the some deeper pleasure that's

109
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,760
not exactly of the Flesh of the being accompanied by your friend and so wow I

110
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,959
mean and that might actually be more nourishing than the sun or uh someone provides you with a

111
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:57,639
wonderful meal but the person who does it like my grandmother when I was maybe

112
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:03,000
eight or seven I would I would lay in bed in Norwegian bed this wooden kind of

113
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,800
all wood Norwegian little room when I grew up in Norway and sunlight coming through in the early morning and as they

114
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:16,720
comforter and I'd be reading Donald Duck magazines and she would come with a

115
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,839
tray with uh milk and toast with Norwegian goat cheese on it and I just

116
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:29,920
took it for granted when I was seven or eight but that has stayed with me my whole life since then as a as an

117
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,880
expression of of a profound pleasure not of the Flesh of not of the you know you

118
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:43,839
know spiritual almost the love that she conveyed the care and which she offered so uh so there's all this whole

119
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:51,759
these two different dimensions and that to go deep into the Dharma we need to appreciate this second dimension not to

120
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:57,440
dismiss pleasures of the of the flesh this worldly pleasures some of them can

121
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,040
be very helpful wonderful inspiring and some of them can be deadly

122
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,880
some of them can ruin lives can ruin societies can ruin

123
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,720
families uh and uh so that's a world that needs a lot of care and uh and a

124
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,800
lot of love and needs a lot of friends to take you out into the sun uh to make

125
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,399
sure that you know something deeper in you is nourished and supported and um but the Dharma practice

126
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:33,240
really wants to support this you know this uh spiritual side or

127
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,680
this not of the flesh side or this I like to I like to call it profound you

128
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,759
know I don't really like the word spiritual too often and I don't really like the word of the flesh for this but

129
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:51,079
I like to say more surface pleasures and profound pleasures and the Dharma Dharma

130
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:56,480
um movement is to start becoming sensitive and aware of these deeper

131
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,199
profound possibilities of well-being that's in here and to nourish that to

132
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:07,680
and to and just recognizing it is part of the nourishment because many people

133
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:15,199
uh haven't even ever learned to tune into that part of themselves uh they're so busy being busy they're so busy being

134
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:22,279
busy that uh that they don't have time for it and so the easy thing is to get be busy than just picking up the sensual

135
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:29,720
Pleasures here and there and get somehow get distracted even more from really feeling what's here in a deep way

136
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:37,240
and um and there's a profound pleasure I don't know pleasure is the right word but profound

137
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,839
rightness in feeling our life from this deep inner place that even if it's pain

138
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:50,000
it just feels so right now I'm with the truth and then as we begin sensitive to

139
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,480
this deeper place of feeling and sensing the profundity then uh to start when

140
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:02,319
it's there start recognizing the goodness that's there the well being that's there so that can grow and that

141
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:09,000
can grow and fill us and create a very different context for how we live our life than the life that's dependent on

142
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,600
being comfortable in the world externally is that

143
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:22,319
adequate thank you so up here

144
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:31,560
Scott and take a stab at circling kind of combining two questions that have been asked I want to Circle back

145
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,920
to well I think most of us I do certainly sort of suffer from a little bit from our psychosocial stress like

146
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:45,160
right now I'm talking to you I have to answer in [Laughter]

147
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,399
publicly uh so uh we could sort of dial into the

148
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:57,319
sematic experience of that and then you want to go a little deeper and I'm

149
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:02,600
looking sort of okay what maybe what am I clinging to and I see these like the

150
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,959
ill Winds of like sort of a thirst for recognition and then insignificance kind

151
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:13,799
of at the other end of that and

152
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,120
um on the other hand those aren't entirely unhealthy I mean we've probably

153
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:26,120
evolved from small bands of humans and it was very important to get along with our

154
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,039
bandmates um so are you sort of suggesting for the last answer with Richard that we sort of befriend a

155
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,320
little bit even even that discomfort in the sense

156
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:46,120
absolutely we should be befriending everything everything needs our

157
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,880
friendship everyone knew okay so in a way maybe just like our reaction to this

158
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,080
discomfort is really just piling it's it's not helpful yeah it's making a much

159
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,880
worse or not useful I I don't so uh yes I could say yes to your what you just

160
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,559
said but I would be reluctant to live in a world where that's the response um I

161
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:17,480
would uh just be ready to just resp to meet everything with care with love with

162
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,760
friendship whatever it might be and you said earlier that you know we I think you said you know we have an

163
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,880
evolutionary conditioning to respond with fear maybe with anger with all

164
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:36,280
kinds of is ways and um and yes that's true the problem becomes and again you

165
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,640
said at the beginning the clinging to it or I said earlier the identification with it or the give granting it

166
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,720
Authority we do all kinds of extra things we lay on top of it and um I

167
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,600
don't know if some of you have seen this I had a wonderful movie called uh I think it's called the perfect day or

168
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,000
perfect day I think it's perfect days right plural right perfect days and

169
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:07,120
uh it's a movie about cleaning toilets in Japan and uh about a toilet cleaner and

170
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:14,159
it's a people who have done uh Zen training in monasteries that I know who seen the movie recognize oh this is Zen

171
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:20,480
training this is like they they just love it and um and that's a whole movie

172
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,270
and um but the in my mind well maybe I should I shouldn't give away the end should I

173
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:32,919
[Laughter] well if you see the

174
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:42,760
end then you'll get part of my response to [Laughter]

175
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,520
you that movie had been recommended to me I haven't seen it yes so see it to

176
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:56,159
the end it all it all comes it all come all be it becomes the the movie perfect days

177
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:02,240
becomes perfect in the last scene so

178
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,520
here so you can mik here

179
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,520
yeah thank you um maybe this is just another variation of the other questions

180
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:25,559
that I've been asked but I'm thinking more and more about how to respond to violence political violence um I was

181
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:31,120
just somewhere recently where someone had a different political

182
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:39,200
perspective and they were forcing it on me and I felt fear of course I felt fear for my family of

183
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,280
course of course how do I both respond with

184
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,960
love and with safety of

185
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,960
course you know you know who John Lewis is

186
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:04,960
was John Lewis had a lot of reasons to be afraid growing up as he did in the

187
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,480
South the time he did I think that he got beat up three

188
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,720
times maybe more in his efforts to uh to

189
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,679
change the violent segregated

190
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:30,520
South there's a beautiful story I think of um he was in a bus stop

191
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,760
and the member of the Klux Clan came and of course he had reasons to be

192
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,039
afraid when they showed up he was doing a demonstr you know nonviolent Civil

193
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:49,799
Disobedience and uh one of them beat him up in

194
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,520
1961 in 2009 the man uh elwin

195
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:04,720
Wilson came to the office his office off he was a congressman so he came to his office in Washington DC with his own son

196
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,559
and came to ask for forgiveness it took 48

197
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:16,440
years for uh John Lewis's willingness to stand

198
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:25,279
there and love rather than succumb to his fear to change this man's

199
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:32,440
heart it's quite phenomenal and uh and John Lewis then went on

200
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,960
1963 I think to do the march from Montgomery to

201
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Selma and he was in the front of that line the police gave him two the group

202
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,279
two minutes to disperse after 1 minute and 5 Seconds they started beating him

203
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:57,440
and the were others he was the first one to be beaten they they fractured his

204
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,080
skull six months later the president of United States Lyndon Johnson signed the

205
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,200
Civil Rights Act that U his willingness to stand

206
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:15,240
there and not be afraid but to love instead change the

207
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,640
country so I respect a lot your fear fear of

208
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:27,080
your family and there's a lot of hatred in our society but I think our society won't

209
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:35,000
change if we get caught in our own fear that the the task of especially

210
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:43,480
this practice that we have here to really help us find a way to uh to um be

211
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:49,520
the change we want to see in our society so that's one of the reasons why

212
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:57,080
this this you know this deep profound place that we talked the Richard's question about this this spiritual or I

213
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:05,159
call profound or there's reason to go in under the layers and find out what's there is so that we can tap into a very

214
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:10,200
different way to respond to the world and to ourselves with love with care

215
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,480
with respect so we can be the change we want to see in the world and respond

216
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:24,158
accordingly but it comes with risks and I don't think we can avoid

217
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:31,480
that but what world do you want your children I don't if you have children but to grow up into what do you want to

218
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:38,120
what do you want to pass on to them and I'll tell you this story I've told the story a few times about what we pass on

219
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:45,080
to our kids uh there was a many years ago there was when I was teaching Retreats there

220
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,679
was a woman who kept coming in my Retreats practicing sincerely and then she came to me one

221
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:56,919
day and said I have cancer but I have this young child I don't know 10 years old or

222
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:02,240
so and I really don't want to die so she did everything she could just to live

223
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:09,600
and then she came to retreat sometime later and said um done everything I could

224
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,360
do but I'm I'm going to die that's the diagnosis now and she was really

225
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,399
angry and I said to her if you die angry

226
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:25,720
that's going to create uh that's going to condition probably your child's whole

227
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:33,399
future life the child's going to see that the response of anger is response

228
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:39,080
which uh around this fear anger is really going to be you know a message

229
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:45,480
about what it's like to to live as a human being in this world but if you could somehow and a in a in a healthy

230
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:52,520
way resolve your anger and be able to die peacefully that will uh change your

231
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:58,480
your daughter son your little child's uh life the rest of their life

232
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,520
and then at some point after the woman died the husband called me and said that

233
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:11,039
she had died and when she died both her and the CH him he and the child were there and uh they both went out into the

234
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,559
garden and got a flower and came back in and put it on her chest and when I heard

235
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:23,279
that little vignette I thought okay she she died peacefully so how you live with this

236
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:29,000
world that's so difficult and so much risk and fear um uh

237
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,159
there's a there's a I hope a loving challenge to you that not from me but

238
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:40,000
from your own heart to meet it in a different way and and find a way to do

239
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,399
that courageously is that an okay answer you want to answer I want to respect the

240
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:54,360
question do you want to ask anything more or thank you thank you

241
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:09,320
um when should one seek a teacher and how does one seek a

242
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,960
teacher because there is um how should I

243
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:24,360
know I guess this in in this journey there's always the feeling of being lost and uh at times it feels like

244
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:30,120
there's someone needs a teacher but then it never yes the journey is difficult at

245
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:38,799
times but how does one seek a teacher is my question I think having a teacher to to

246
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:45,200
support one in practice is invaluable and I've had a number of teachers I I probably I'm very confident if I didn't

247
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,440
have my teachers didn't have a fellow practitioners to practice with that I

248
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,519
probably wouldn't have practiced as much as I have so I really depended on that

249
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:02,519
support all around and uh and how one finds a teacher that really is works for you as

250
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:08,960
a person is kind of like um magic or or the chemistry of it and you know it's

251
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:15,000
it's unknown so one possibility is to go spend time with different teachers until

252
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,279
you feel a resonance with someone or you feel really trust in someone or feel inspired by what they they have and even

253
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:29,399
then you want to be careful the Buddha himself said that you used to hang out with a teacher for some time before you

254
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:34,799
decide to be their student uh to really feel confident that you know them and

255
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:42,720
know their different know their quirks he didn't say that but but um but uh know their ethics know

256
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,640
who they are and um and so don't don't be quick in choosing someone but so you

257
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:56,960
kind of look around and search around there is a kind of common maybe folklore and spiritual circles that um that the

258
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,600
teacher will find you not because they're looking for you but somehow it'll happen kind of when you're

259
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:09,080
not looking exactly um but you have to do your part which is to so you can nowadays you can

260
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,640
listen to people's Dharma talks online and see if you know to check out many

261
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:22,080
people really quickly and um but that's the work you have to do and then when you find

262
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,640
someone that you feel some resonance with um uh in some spiritual circles

263
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:34,200
some Buddha circles uh you have to have a certain amount of um healthy

264
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,360
assertiveness to go ask the teacher what you know how they're

265
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,600
available or are they available and or what does it mean to be a student for you if I want to I want to study with

266
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,200
you what does it mean to study with you how does that work and and um and different teachers will have different

267
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,600
answers and you can hear the answers I'm I'm causing trouble for myself

268
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:02,840
now uh they uh when they hear the answer then that helps you understand also if this

269
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,679
is the right person for you is this an okay qu answer thank

270
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:12,240
you so now

271
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,840
here uh so how would you explain or describe the benefits or the purpose of

272
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,039
meditation to somebody who has an experience that who doesn't know anything about

273
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:35,720
meditation I think it it's so contextual so it's you know without having the context it's a little hard to how to

274
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:41,440
answer I but the how would be I would try to do it very briefly I would try to

275
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,760
say something that's memorable to them and uh so not to go into a whole

276
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:55,600
Treatise and bring out the clinical studies and uh so so um so for example I might

277
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:02,080
say something like so you can really be your yourself you know that that's pretty

278
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,080
vague but it's but it's memorable and it's meaningful for some people and oh

279
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:14,799
what does that mean or yes that that sounds like a healthy good thing and so what we I wouldn't say is yes when you

280
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:20,799
can really be yourself uh you go beyond yourself you know but but I might say

281
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:28,039
that at your in context so rather than saying so you could really be yourself I might say to someone else I might say um

282
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:33,799
maybe they it might maybe they already have a meditation practice and be doing it for a while and so they know it all

283
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:42,559
and so or they have a spiritual practice or some kind so they kind of have already have some sensibility I might say uh uh just that

284
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:49,000
that oh uh so you can really be yourself so you can go beyond

285
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:55,120
yourself so is but uh I mean there's I can give many more answers but are you

286
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,480
asking for yourself uh no uh more just trying to understand like uh from the

287
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:07,919
perspective of like say an average person who doesn't know anything about Buddhism or kind of the benefits of meditation like what's a good kind of

288
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,919
short answer to give to explain to them why they might be interested in yeah so it's again so so contextual someone else

289
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,519
I might say um it's really a good way to distress you know we have so much stress

290
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,279
in our society this is a really good way to kind of settle and and it's probably you know it's it's a healthy way of

291
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:32,039
finding it to just d-stress you know all someone else I might say uh

292
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:41,320
this is how you get to see the truth the truth of yourself so there's all these answers so um you know if uh I

293
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:46,639
don't I I don't want to again I'm causing trouble for myself but what would be really

294
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:53,559
interesting fascinating is to have a teacher maybe like me some other teacher uh go around and answer that question

295
00:32:53,559 --> 00:33:00,600
for each of you because I bet the question the answer will be different for each one of

296
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:03,840
you yes

297
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:13,600
Morgan so um I have a question that relates to somewhat uh the earlier

298
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:20,760
questions and that in meditation has become very popularized so to speak so

299
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:26,000
if and I run into people that are that have a meditation practice without the

300
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,799
other part and so I feel sometimes I'm walking a line that you I'm not trying

301
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:39,039
to proze or you know to tell them how joyful it can be to add Buddhism to it

302
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:45,320
and so I don't know how to navigate that somehow because sometimes I feel that uh

303
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,799
maybe I am pushing the Buddhism part because it's so rich with yeah you know

304
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:57,880
it can enhance the other part yeah so I'm not sure how to navigate that um

305
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:04,919
well F we'll answer your question but uh I just want to First say that I love that you're asking the question because

306
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:11,000
I think it comes from someplace deep in you and would you ever mind saying

307
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,200
something about that depth

308
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:22,520
um why I'm asking the question yeah well because you know when we talk about the

309
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:29,079
the sanha in the the Buddhist circles and so I find that um

310
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:34,599
I enjoy it the friendships more when I can learn from them too so some of my

311
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:42,760
friends become my teachers uh when they're rooted in the same practice that I have great but I like to be open and

312
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,280
uh when when I'm talking to people about you know recently I've had a a new

313
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,800
friend that started to to meditate and she likes it she's in France and she she

314
00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:00,680
she has been following on YouTube so I'm I'm not sure when or if I should even

315
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:08,760
talk about the other side yes yes CU I don't want to turn her off from the meditation uhhuh so um well thank you it

316
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:16,480
was great to have that context for you from you personally for that question and um so what you said in response to

317
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,920
mine was my question was that a lot of do with had to do with the friendship and the support of the SAA friends and

318
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:30,240
all that so I think my first answer to you is without telling you you're being being her sa friend uh just be her

319
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,440
friend with her meditation practice be the supporter of it be just kind of you

320
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,200
know be there to you know maybe talk about it a little bit

321
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,240
with her or share your experience in meditation or just kind of say you know there's you know find find ways to

322
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:54,280
without making without telling her anything about Buddhism and just say you know just kind of accompany her a little

323
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:01,760
bit on her meditation path so be be that friend for her without touching the other parts of it

324
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:08,560
well I think that what I just said now is would be the first first line the first thing to approach and but then

325
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,880
it's okay within a certain with with a certain uh certain

326
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,000
um Simplicity to say something like you

327
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,560
know uh this uh I see you're meditating some and listening to the talk some and

328
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:33,440
um you know there's uh I found so much value to be in the S to have other Dharma friends who share this practice

329
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,480
with um you know if you'd like to come with me to IMC one day or uh you know

330
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:45,839
let's go together so you you're giving her the message but you're doing it in such a way that um you're

331
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:52,200
not poking her at it with it you're not like s telling her that she should but

332
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:58,440
you're you're say this is what I found useful and here you know it's available to you and if you like to come with me

333
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:06,000
I'll you happy to go with you um so keep it really simple and uh and that's

334
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:29,920
enough I I think Kirk was had his hand up be first in the

335
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:37,599
back so first of all thank you Gil and thank you everybody this this is really

336
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,720
helpful for me and my question has to do with courage because when you were

337
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:52,960
talking with this gentleman's question about John Lewis and standing up there and um it it took a lot of Courage I'm

338
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:00,119
sure and so if you could share some thoughts about that and how one can actess courage in their own life and

339
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:07,280
then I also want to just add that uh courage um comes in French the word

340
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,520
kurur is your heart so that just occurred to me that there's some heart going on with courage but if you could

341
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:21,560
say something about that uh and you know I I don't know your context in your life well enough but uh

342
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:28,720
as a so I want to be careful what I say and just talk a little bit in generalities maybe and hope it maybe

343
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,400
fits is that um uh you let begin your

344
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,119
courage with having courage to face yourself to be with yourself sit and

345
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,160
meditate in a courageous posture which maybe means sitting up a

346
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,480
little bit straighter and taking a stance internal psychological stance to really like your

347
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,960
be courageous and then be really honest about what's happening with you

348
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,720
uh I like I I I a wonderful for me a wonderful synonym for mindfulness or for

349
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:09,680
meditation is honesty so you know it's um you know you

350
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,800
asked about what's you know what's the benefits from meditation um to me that's I would for

351
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:21,680
some people I would say um that oh meditation is just a way of being

352
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:28,040
honest and uh and it's being honest with yourself a radical truthtellah

353
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:35,400
so maybe start with yourself and and do it in a more in a deeper more more

354
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:41,480
thorough way maybe you've ever had been before I don't I don't associate you with being a dishonest

355
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:47,280
person but uh but to really know yourself and there might be some context in

356
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,920
life where uh that process is supported maybe put yourself in situations where

357
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,800
you normally shut down or reactive or afid and really take that courageous

358
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:07,560
stance maybe in your meditation or mindfulness and really start being with the fullness of yourself in that uh if

359
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,920
you have a really good friend uh you might ask the friend say to the friend

360
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,079
what I just instructing you to do or suggesting to you and uh and ask them if

361
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,599
there's any any direction that they understand about your life or you think it would be useful for you to be more

362
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,920
honest about for yourself or see the truth of they don't have to have the answer answer they just oh it just you

363
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:35,280
know I think it might have to do with some quality of the heart that needs needs your attention

364
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,960
they might be that vague but uh but that's so that's my response I hope that's

365
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:49,680
okay question yes this will can be the last one

366
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:56,079
thanks so this uh conversation reminds me of a teacher I had in grad school a

367
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:02,960
guy named Charles hamton Turner who um believed in connecting

368
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:09,520
opposite values sorry he believed in connecting opposite values and he would

369
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:16,119
say and I hope I get this right courage without caution is

370
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:23,760
recklessness caution without courage is cowardice very

371

human being and may your profundity support this world that we're

374
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:54,200
