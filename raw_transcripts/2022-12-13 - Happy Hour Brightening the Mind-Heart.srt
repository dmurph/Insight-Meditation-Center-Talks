28
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,420

29
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:13,200

here we go okay so welcome welcome to happy hour

33
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:40,459
I've missed you all I've missed you guys um and and I've been

34
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:48,299
not far I've been steeped into Dharma last week I was teaching a residential retreat at Spirit Rock on befriending

35
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:54,860
mortality unmindfulness of death which as many of you know is a topic that I love

36
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:02,159
and death these are the two topics I love to teach about and many other ones but these two special especially so

37
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,739
so the topic I wanted to bring in for our reflection tonight in in meta in

38
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:16,919
loving kindness is um is perhaps inspired from the retreat but

39
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,380
is also um inspired from some Reflections I've

40
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:29,759
had in my own life um uh recently today um and that is you know with when we know

41
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,699
our time is short and with uh the practice of of meta is one way to

42
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:42,840
beautify our mind a way to Glad in our mind for us to learn what it means to

43
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:50,160
Glad in our hearts glad in our minds both in Daily Life as a resource and

44
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,380
when we have challenges when we have difficulty when we have pain when

45
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:04,139
um and of course a death bit too but but really it's it's it it's a support for for our life learning how to beautify

46
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:10,139
and glad in our mind through meta and kindness for ourselves and others

47
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:16,919
and also the way that this other reflection of brevity our time comes in is is

48
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,620
um as you reflect as you as we will do in the guided meditation together with

49
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:29,340
mindfulness of the body and the breath as we will settle in um but the practice of you know life is

50
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:37,080
short what's what's happening right now in my mind stream what's happening am I stressed am I worrying am I having ill

51
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,020
will feelings like if this was my last moment in life so it was my last breath

52
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:49,759
is this what I want to be spending my time doing worrying or or

53
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:57,000
planning Ad nauseam and and um you know how do I want to be spending

54
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,780
this precious time if this were my last moment How would is whatever is happening right now is

55
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:10,680
this how I want to be spending it is this what I want to be cultivating and of course menta thoughts of kindness for

56
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:17,280
ourselves for others love forgiveness um vicarious Joy all the Brahma viharas

57
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,380
Equanimity are all these beautiful states that both beautify them the mind

58
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,419
and heart both for any moment where there's the last moment of Our Lives

59
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:34,199
last breath or also as we as we create our own Karma as we weave the future

60
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:40,680
moments as we precondition the future moments so if we if in this moment we

61
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:48,060
have a kind thought a generous thought a thought of forgiveness Etc all the beautiful hard qualities we precondition

62
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,460
ourselves to have more of those feelings and thoughts towards ourselves and

63
00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:00,840
others in the future moments whatever thoughts you have now precondition you to have more of those in the in the

64
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,979
minutes hours days years to come so

65
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:15,720
so lots of ways to relate to this to the to the beauty to the to the value

66
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:23,580
of practicing the Brahma vihara's meta um meta loving-kindness compassion

67
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,880
karuna muddita vicarious joy and upeka and

68
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:37,620
um so so I think that's all I want to say for

69
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:45,419
to set up to set up the stage for our practice tonight and then let's just practice together no

71

relaxantly sitting upright allowing your back to be straight

76
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,759
as if it's pulled up by an invisible string

77
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:34,339
sense of Integrity sitting up like a mountain

78
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,940
letting your feet be stable in the earth touching the Earth

79
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:53,240
creating your sitting bones sitting belts where what you sit on

80
00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:00,620
connected to the Earth via the chair or the cushion

81
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:10,680
and releasing releasing the weight of your upper body releasing

82
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,019

83
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:29,060
a few minutes just feel the bottom of your feet and the Earth the bottom of your

84
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,899
sit bones connected connected

86
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,100
and my toes end

87
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,880
feeling the weight

88
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:20,519
we might have seen helium balloons that are lighting and Light

89
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:27,899
go up in the sky and often there's a weight there's a

90
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,120
weight attached to the helium balloon

91
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:41,420
to bring stability to it let your body be that weight that counterweight

92
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,680
that stabilizes the helium balloons of thought

93
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:55,639
distractions your body it's a wonderful counterweight

94
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,260
let yourself enjoy the breath

95
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:09,019
enjoy the breath moving through this body

96
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:21,240
when the Mind enjoys what it's doing when the heart enjoys

97

gladdening via reflecting our own goodness on our own goodness

131
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:11,100
to hear a city seeing yourself externally

132
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,620
from the outside this person knows you

133
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:32,640
you'd be reflecting on something kind of generous we've done recently or some time ago it

134
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,419
doesn't matter maybe an act of forgiveness or generosity

135
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:44,820
however small doesn't matter or maybe you

136

said some kind words to someone or to yourself

137
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,960
maybe you did something nice for someone help them out

138
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,500
and maybe you're kind to yourself

139
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:16,940
and give yourself a hard time about something very gentle forgiving

140
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,020

177
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:06,539

178

180
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,200

181

however they see you appreciate you respect you love you let yourself be seen

182
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:50,100
as if reflecting through these mirrors them seeing you you seeing them seeing

183
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:56,279
you let yourself appreciate your own goodness through their eyes

184
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:59,659
what they see in you

185
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:09,740
let your light shine Let It Shine

186
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,659
by letting our light shine

187
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:34,278
the goodness in us not belittling it

188
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,960
but by seeing and appreciating appreciating it it's not an act of ego

189
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,240
but seeing goodness helps goodness increase

190
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,820
brightening the heart and mind

191
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:05,898

200
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,960
and if you as if you were witnessing observing lots of points of light

201
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,140
lots of points of light on this planet Earth

202
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:39,659

returning towards the good to uplift the heart and mind

213
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:11,420

214
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,900

223
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,560
act in goodness

224
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:47,420
make a change even if it's just small change for one person

225
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,400
may we all wake up to the preciousness

226
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,579
and the goodness enormous

227
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:37,020
you all before I open the space for reflections

228
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:42,540
I wanted to share a little uh story that my co-teacher Beth shared on the um

229
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:50,040
Retreat we were just teaching and I paraphrased it um it's a Zen story

230
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,680
and it goes something like this but um incense stories there's

231
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:03,599
often there are two archetypes there's the um the warrior archetype and

232
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:11,880
um and a monk archetype so in this story there is a a samurai a warrior but

233
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:18,119
um that is very full of themselves and uh goes to a monk

234
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:24,180
and says you know something like um tell me

235
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:29,339
everything you know about Awakening tell me everything you know about

236
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:34,160
Awakening in the Monk [Music] um

237
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,920
says oh to you something like that I might be

238
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,079
paraphrasing but the punch line would be the same so bear with me so so the the

239
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:52,920
monk says what to you so it doesn't really show the samurai the respect that he feels he deserves so in the ramp

240
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:59,040
Samurai gets gets really oh yeah I think the question was tell me everything you know about

241
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,980
Awakening in heaven and hell maybe something maybe that was the question hey I have to look up the the but anyway

242
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:10,980
the punchline will stay the same so so the summer I will get really really angry and and

243
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:16,079
um he pulls up his sword and is about to to

244
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:22,260
when wants to cut the the the head of the monk off and the monk still with a

245
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,359
lot of equanimity stands and says Ah that's hell

246
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:35,160
and delighted at this Insight oh yeah this is a state of hell I'm angry and wow how

247
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,260
quickly that happened and I don't want to be angry so a sense of a smile shows

248
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:47,280
up on the face of the summer I haven't gotten the wisdom the Deep wisdom oh yeah that's that's uh what what hell is

249
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,320
and so he smiles and the monk goes that's heaven

250
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,380
so such a simple description of heavil

251
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:04,820
Heaven and Hell in this realm in this body and the Brahma viharas it the

252
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:12,020
gladdening of the heart our Heavenly States and when we're angry and and

253
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:18,420
upset or blaming or self-recriminating or so many difficult states of mind

254
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:24,480
that's hell that's hell so it's helpful to just call it that sometimes if you

255
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,520
find yourself in this hellish states of mind like oh sweetheart this is hell

256
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:36,180
this is hell do you really want to be in hell do you want to be perpetuating states of hell

257
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:42,839
um drop it just drop it and turn you have a choice turn the Mind towards wholesome

258
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:48,119
States wholesome states of Mind towards Heavenly states of mind

259
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:54,720
forgiveness kindness um so I'm sure there are many questions that

260
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,660
can arise but I'll just leave it at that and open now for for reflections

261
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:07,500
well what came up for you in the meditation question you can either type them in chat or you can raise your Zoom

262
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:14,040
hand because if you raise your physical hand I will not see you there are many of us but if you raise your Zoom hand

263
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:20,960
then I can see your questions comments uh complaints it's all welcomed

264
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:46,079
okay so any Reflections from the the guided meditation

265
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:55,820
Stephanie says great meditation thank you Stephanie oh and I see Katrin raising their hand Catherine

266
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:03,300
um hi hi great to see you again thank you

267
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:10,200
I was just on a retreat and the practice was so much about being with whatever

268
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,900
arose without judgment and so I wonder about like the third punchline of that

269
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:24,000
story because he asked three in the way you told that he has three things so then what is Awakening oh yeah I didn't

270
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,040
tell it well very well I think he might have just asked about heaven and hell or maybe he just asked about Awakening

271
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:35,340
there was no a third punch line I appreciate I feel good in myself

272
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:41,339
[Laughter] being like um that and I don't know if you would

273
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:50,880
agree but that Awakening is is holding Heaven and Hell as maybe all one or or being in

274
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:58,079
Equanimity whatever's arising and how that's not contradictory to cultivating

275
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,940
uh wholesome states of mind

276
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:10,920
yes yes and I think that is beautiful yes um yes and

277
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:17,160
I think Awakening holds that includes that but it's more than that it's not just that

278
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:24,540
it's not so I wouldn't equate Awakening with Equanimity I think Equanimity is a

279
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:30,359
um uh something that arises is is something arises from from Awakening and also

280
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:37,920
Equanimity leads to States a week but they're not equivalent so I wouldn't say that Equanimity is Awakening yeah but

281
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,380
yeah they're definitely definitely related but I think the point you're really trying to make is is not

282
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:50,160
um to to um yeah so so so yes there is and I think

283
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,920
it's an important one and I expected someone to bring it up and I'm glad you have Katrin which is the sense that yes

284
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,680
these whole unwholesome states arise and by shaming ourselves and pushing them

285
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,740
away it doesn't really help and yet in our practice we do try to cultivate wholesome States and yet on wholesome

286
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:14,720
states are going to arise so how do we work with them skillfully and one way to work with them skillfully is through

287
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:20,700
Equanimity and there are many other skillful ways to to work with them but I think the point you're trying to bring

288
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:26,940
in as from The Retreat that you just saw it is not to shame ourselves because of the negative states of mind and

289
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:32,640
absolutely that's an important point yeah but to work with them skillfully

290
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:38,280
with wisdom with mindfulness with with vipassana and also with compassion so I

291
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:45,680
think that that point stance yeah two more hands I see Jesse please

292
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:53,460
oh yeah thanks for this practice today um yeah I wanted to ask about I think normally this works pretty well

293
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:59,040
for me in this practice um but what was coming up really strongly for me today well I wanted to

294
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:06,180
ask about pre-practice attachments this experience came up for me where it's kind of cute I

295
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:12,420
think when I was four years old I had a balloon tied to my wrist and it flew away and I lost the balloon and I was

296
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:18,119
really sad and you know so at the time I was like I'm four years old and I really wanted this

297
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:23,520
balloon it was really important to me and but that was coming up now today in this present moment experience and I

298
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:30,359
just I didn't really it didn't feel appropriate to be talking about Duca and letting go to

299
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:37,140
this four-year-old child so I was just wondering you know about when memories come up you know from

300
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:42,240
childhood you know that that are you know pre-date you know my Buddhist

301
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:49,140
practice like how to practice compassion in those moments yeah yeah yeah great I appreciate I

302
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:56,339
appreciate that and and it's and maybe it came up because in the invitations I was sharing um

303
00:45:56,339 --> 00:46:01,440
uh you know the the image of you know let the balloons fly away and maybe that

304
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:08,220
that helped bring in this memory that you had many years ago in the sense of grief and then the Letting Go came up so

305
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:14,640
so um um I I think there are multiple things

306
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:20,940
you're what you're asking again and and just to be brief I think one is when there is a four-year-old well there's a

307
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:27,839
four-year-old that you couldn't talk to or couldn't be talked to about letting go and just things things come and

308
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:35,400
things go but but now that four-year-old within you you can't talk to them there is an older and wiser Jesse who

309
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:43,380
understands things arise and pass away so that's part of reparenting ourselves with kindness with compassion so it's

310
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:48,480
actually quite a gift that this came up because there's something in there that

311
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,579
can be a younger version of you and that those deep memories to to re learn

312
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:59,900
yourself with kindness with care uh the truth of impermanence

313
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:07,520
beautiful thank you thanks Jesse Fred please

314
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:19,980
thank you um welcome back Nikki it's it's great to have you back thank you uh

315
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:25,680
as I was picturing the people who I

316
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:32,760
in envisioned being purveyors of kindness and uh and other good things

317
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:40,079
um I feel them very richly and uh with a lot of detail and a real felt

318
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:49,260
sensibility there's nothing theoretical about it when I return to myself it's not as though I'm I feel like I'm

319
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:57,420
um I'm not skeptical of those virtues in myself but I don't experience it with the same richness as I do looking at

320
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:05,520
someone else and when I tried using the eyes of the other person to see me like

321
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:11,940
that didn't quite pull it together for me either and I wonder if you have a yeah

322
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:17,640
yeah thank you thanks for sharing that um I wonder when you tried the eyes of the

323
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:24,839
other person instead of just your own eyes directly whether that was any more effective even if a tiny bit

324
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:30,300
more effective in saying your own good tiny bit tiny good tiny bit is better

325
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:36,720
than zero yeah that tends to help actually that tends to so so

326
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,760
um I would say Fred hang in there with that with seeing yourself Through The

327
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:48,240
Eyes of another but really really taking their perspective like letting go of your own perspective completely and

328
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:53,400
seeing really doing perspective taking and it can take a little while and and

329
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:59,280
this was a relatively short meditation but really taking a while to do that perspective taking from their

330
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,740
perspective something kind that you just and then really feeling into it yes they

331
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:11,339
really see me as kind or generous or thoughtful and that thing I I did for them yeah that really made a difference

332
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:16,380
to their it's a really lean into the perspective taking and can take a little

333
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:23,460
while but but don't make it just black and white because I think we just did the graphite a little black and white drawing but really pull out the

334
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:31,020
watercolors and and make it as as as um as Vivid as you possibly can okay

335
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:37,760
thank you thank you Fred thanks so much there was one and one last oh we should go into to practice

336
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,839
if it's too late but one person has asked about how people confuse kindness

337
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:51,240
for weakness which not true because kindness really uh includes ourselves as 360 degrees so

338
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:58,260
um it's that that often comes out with a sense of confusing kindness with with weakness and and maybe I'll talk more

339
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:03,599
about it next time but it's um you know kindness is 360 degrees and includes

340
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:10,500
yourself and when you are kind to yourself you're not letting letting people um take advantage of you so so we do we

341
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:16,560
need to I turn to small groups right now otherwise we'll have no time for the

342
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:24,119
breakout groups folks so so thank you for Reflections thank you for um everyone who's spoken so I'm going to

343
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:31,578
make the groups and here is the invitation the invitation is that we will um

344
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:38,160
um speak about you know something about a goodness some some other person's

345
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:45,359
goodness having seen their goodness what does it feel like when you see someone else's goodness how does that how how

346
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:50,760
does that light up your heart when you reflect on and really appreciate someone

347
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:57,000
else's goodness um and and I think through that we can

348
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,579
um yeah I think that's what let's just say that's prominent actually I realize that practice me the small groups are

349
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:08,220
going to be pretty short tonight so it might be just a quick round going around and again just speak from your own

350
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:14,640
experience and the next person then the next person will go alphabetically not directing not asking questions it'll

351
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:21,960
just be a 30-second monologue no reflecting on someone else's goodness what came up for you in this practice

352
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:29,838
um so I'm going to open all the rooms take care of each other take care of yourselves here we go
