1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,759
so I'll just mention a word or two about our theme for today

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:13,019
uh or a game for this week actually is factors that build a wise stability in

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,660
unity or unification especially in meditation and also in

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,260
daily life I'll be spending most of the time talking about the meditative aspects and

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:33,660
a little bit in how to apply it in the rest of our lives which is where this practice really matures

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,780
so good morning good to see all of you and the invitation is after you've greeted your friends

7
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,739
to settle back relax and take a good posture for a

8
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,019
balance of relaxation and alertness

9
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,920
allowing yourself to go inward

10
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:18,299
starting with a few slightly deeper slower belly breaths allowing your belly to

11
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,700
relax stop it

12
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,060
[Music] and allowing your breathing to return to

13
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,240
normal

14
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,540

and sweeping through the body allowing the eyes to relax and soften

18
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,260

19
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,220

thank you for the sincerity of your practice

100
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,220
foreign

101
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:12,120
special welcome to those of you who tiptoed into the YouTube session a

102
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:19,520
little bit late and a warm welcome to those of you who have been here for the whole meditation

103
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:27,240
the theme for this week is factors of wise stability and unification

104
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,880
which is um otherwise known as five qualities of

105
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,399
mind that are called the jonic factors because when balanced

106
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,860
and in play they are supports for deep meditative States known as Jonas

107
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:49,340
and my focus to speak is not going to be on those deep States

108
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:56,539
instead we'll cover how recognizing and navigating these five factors of mind

109
00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:02,880
with the support of mindfulness and intelligence supports the deepening of

110
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,399
our meditation practice and it supports wisdom more broadly

111
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:14,760
I also will touch on how recognizing and cultivating these capacities of our

112
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:21,419
minds beneficial not just to meditation but a little bit to our relational life as

113
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:29,100
well so that's the overview today I'll talk about how mindfulness

114
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:36,659
and practice intelligence our helpful Foundation to cultivate meditative stability and

115
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:42,419
these factors and then over the course of the week we'll cover the mental factors of

116
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:47,940
connecting and sustaining otherwise known as a vitaka and Bichara

117
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:54,179
joy and happiness and Pali

118
00:33:54,419 --> 00:34:02,039
unity and unification which is a kaga or a kagata in Pali

119
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:07,260
and so that will take us through Thursday and then Friday to wrap up

120
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:14,280
I'll talk about how these factors when imbalance contribute to a refinement of

121
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:20,940
meditative practice stability and wisdom so that's the overview

122
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:27,500
hope you stay for it and today

123
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:38,300
mindfulness and practice intelligence and these this sort of broad base of

124
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:44,339
overall mindful awareness of the entire process of what's happening within us as

125
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:52,440
best we can see lends itself to developing a kind of understanding of practice intelligence

126
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:58,020
that is a super helpful context when wanting to deepen meditation that's

127
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:04,980
already a sign of a certain kind of depth and breadth and

128
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:10,260
the five tonic factors exist within this Ecology of our minds just like

129
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,720
everything else that exists in their distraction or love or Joy or

130
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:22,079
whatever right like many other mental factors or

131
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,500
qualities of our heart to mind they can be beneficial to our lives in some ways

132
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:33,140
and if misdirected they can be unbeneficial

133
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:39,359
so that's why it's so important to cultivate mindful awareness awareness as

134
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,940
a foundation there's a simile that I'm going to use

135
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:51,560
this is a modern simile but let's say you're a bicycle writer okay

136
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:58,740
the handlebars are the intelligence the bicycle Rider themselves is

137
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:05,460
mindfulness and Equanimity steadiness balance is the

138
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:11,339
balance of the bicycle as it moves along and then the bike path or the road is

139
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:17,040
the noble Eightfold Path so it gives you an idea that the

140
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:26,420
mindfulness and the intelligence practice intelligence are kind of in charge of where we go on the path right

141
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:34,260
so as many of you know from having been here some of you for quite some time

142
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:40,040
mindful awareness Sati mindfulness is the capacity to know what's going on

143
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:46,500
while it's happening within and around us right

144
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:52,980
and this is especially true when starting to deepen our practice of being

145
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:59,040
aware of the qualities or attitude of our own heart and mind

146
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,560
one of my Burmese teachers talks about the way that mindful awareness gathers

147
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,560
data gathers information like a scientist or a researcher might

148
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,839
and this Gathering process is helped by being able to settle back

149
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:24,920
soft and open be aware without an agenda in the moment

150
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:32,839
aspiration is great aspiration for Freedom more healing more more love whatever it is

151
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:38,400
and lack of agenda helps us to see it all

152
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,599
see all of it the good bad the ugly the Beautiful

153
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,640
all of it it's also really helpful to engage

154
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,599
intelligence practice intelligence and by that I mean it's okay to bring your whole mind to

155
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:05,099
bear on meditation get curious get interested in the information that mindfulness is

156
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:13,920
gathering in the moment start to connect the dots practice intelligence begins to connect the dots

157
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:22,680
and this emerges it's not a discursive kind of analysis but an emergent kind of understanding

158
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:30,180
that naturally develops in each of us over time regardless of age or IQ or of

159
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:35,339
grade level whatever formal education this is a different kind of intelligence

160
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:42,720
it's our natural Birthright this kind of intelligence or wisdom

161
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,180
begins to seek cause and effect Discerning what's beneficial or

162
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:54,420
unbeneficial right and that's especially in terms of these

163
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:00,500
factors of mine sometimes the these words translate

164
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:05,579
which is skillful or unskillable wholesome or animals and that's a very

165
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:12,060
simple incisive discernment and is this good right now or is it not

166
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:18,599
helpful there's a simile in the ancient

167
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:25,980
teachings I believe this is from the numerical discourses that the Buddha talks about mindfulness as a gatekeeper

168
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:31,260
and he uses the gatekeeper as a simile quite often this particular one

169
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:37,079
is a gatekeeper who is in front of a walled city as they were in those days

170
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:45,060
city state and he or she lets in has the discernment to

171
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:50,099
really let in and direct people who are good for

172
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:56,579
contributing to the city or have Messengers for the leader and directing them to the right place to go the center

173
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:02,280
of the city and then for others he directs them to what they need

174
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:08,339
and for the people who aren't so helpful for the city

175
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:13,680
criminals for example you might not let them in at all

176
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,020
so this is a factor of intelligent mindfulness

177
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:25,500
it's accepting whatever is arising if it's already in the city the city being our body

178
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:31,200
it's accepting that it's there while Discerning whether or not it's helpful

179
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:38,000
to continue to feed it or to let it go and Usher it away

180
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:45,300
we begin to see with mindfulness and practice intelligence

181
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:52,140
when conditions are in place for meditation to take a certain direction including developing meditative

182
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:56,059
stability and unification

183
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:02,240
some mindfulness and practice

184
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:10,440
reveal practice intelligence reveal whether or how any particular mental factor is

185
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,660
useful or not in the sort of purpose for the purpose

186
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:22,260
of cultivating meditation or for cultivating other activities and I'll get into that more as the week goes

187
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:29,700
along so again be takan Bichara connecting and

188
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:35,820
sustaining Piti and sukha Joy

189
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:43,500
contentment happiness and akaga or kagata One pointed

190
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:50,400
Focus immersion absorption and the intelligence of prey and the

191
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,980
mindfulness at play helped to steer this whole process is this the time to unify

192
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:04,700
and gather is this particular factor of joy for example helpful or distracting right now

193
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:11,760
or is something else called for sometimes a broader knowledge

194
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,099
a broader understanding of what is operating in our hearts and Minds

195
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:22,160
it's actually more helpful and integrating

196
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,680
stabilizing prior to cultivating more of these factors

197
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:34,260
there's an example from my own life I I was an artist for many years practicing artists

198
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:40,260
and I attended this group of figure drawing people for years it was a lot of

199
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:45,720
fun but we got to see each other work as well as as drawing and inevitably it

200
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:52,079
would happen especially for those of us who are newer that someone would be focused in on this

201
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:58,800
detailed gorgeous rendering of say a hand or an ear or a face

202
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,859
however they were still focused on the details that they didn't step back to notice

203
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:10,440
that the hand was five times too big or the head was half the size it should

204
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:16,920
be in proportion to the rest of the drawing it's kind of like this

205
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,800
the mindful awareness the practice intelligence help us understand when it's helpful

206
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:29,220
to dive into the details and absorb and be focused and when maybe it's helpful

207
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:34,220
to step back and take a look at the bigger picture

208
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:40,920
we never have complete knowledge but a sense of how the proportions of

209
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:46,079
what's happening in our minds and hearts are and lives are working can be really

210
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:52,020
helpful before absorbing into details so

211
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:59,339
mindfulness and practice intelligence are the foundation for the cultivation of these

212
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:07,140
five hydronic factors five factors of wise stability and unity unification

213
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:14,099
they operate in our minds and hearts and deep practice and they provide a resource and sometimes a frame for

214
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:21,119
understanding our relational lives tomorrow I'll shift to the five factors

215
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:28,859
proper with the first two connecting and sustaining meanwhile perhaps just notice the range

216
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:36,079
of mindful awareness in your heart mind life and if it makes sense maybe talk about

217
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:42,980
what kind of intelligence emerges for you with a Dharma friend between now

218
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,440
so it's a delight to be with you Sangha we look forward to being with you tomorrow

219
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,160
thank you

220
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,650
