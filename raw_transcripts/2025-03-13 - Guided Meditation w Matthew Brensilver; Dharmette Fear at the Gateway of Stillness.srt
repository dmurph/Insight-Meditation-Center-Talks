1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:20,760
okay so uh so welcome folks uh good to good to be with you

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,960
um yeah I don't have anything to say let's um let's practice together for

3
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:15,439
maybe a few uh deeper breaths just to uh land

4
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:22,079
here maybe deeper than any other breath

5
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,920
today for

6
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:12,319
and maybe we uh make a kind of promise to our worries and

7
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:19,599
preoccupations the the Loose Ends of uh any human

8
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,560
life kind of make a promise that

9
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,879
um I'll get back to you I won't neglect you

10
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,480
forever we're just queuing to uh the Deep

11
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,280
Mind that is it's uh okay

12
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,200
to put down the ordinary defenses

13
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,080
okay to stand

14
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,920
defenseless just to offer up our heart to this

15
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
moment

16
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
e e

17
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,280
whatever you think your life

18
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,599
is lay it

19
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,720
down the sense of the the project of your life

20
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,080
all the metrics we have just lay it

21
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
down

22
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,560
e e

23
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,360
and we're practicing knowing uh

24
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,759
experience very simply what would it be to

25
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,039
breathe without elaboration

26
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:40,440
every moment is so ripe with a potential energy like it

27
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:48,120
can go so many ways and we feel so compelled

28
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,599
to elaborate on

29
00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:01,000
experience keep our reference points

30
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:19,759
here we just uh are a body breathing

31
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,839
simple

32
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
intimate

33
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

34
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

35
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

36
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

37
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
e e

38
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,279
and practice can feel hard instructions can feel

39
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,959
like a cruel

40
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:27,160
joke tension squirly tired or wired or both

41
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,000
but we often only a

42
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,040
few mindful breaths away from something

43
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:59,880
shifting and we just uh attune to this subtlety that shift

44
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,600
appreciate

45
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:31,120
it keep going

46
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

47
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

48
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

49
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

50
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

51
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

52
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

53
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,880
e e

54
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:16,080
even the Assumption I'm a I'm a human can Cloud The View

55
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:36,080
we get more quiet we become more sensitive to the ways

56
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,640
we construct the the Avatar of

57
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,280
self the little bits of sense data that go

58
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,080
unnoticed and become the ground of

59
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
self

60
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

61
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

62
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

63
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
e e

64
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:22,279
what if uh you were never seen

65
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:30,520
like you were never an object in the mind of another

66
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:52,679
likewise no mirrors no never uh an object in your own mind

67
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:06,279
just empty phenomena rolling

68
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
on

69
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

70
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

71
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

72
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

73
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

74
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

75
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

76
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

77
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

78
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
e e

79
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,080
e

80
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:30,360
okay so a

81
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:39,600
question um that was uh sent to me uh person writes as I get deeper in

82
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,720
meditation composed and almost concentrated fear pops up flips the

83
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,399
ejector seat and out I bounce I

84
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:57,240
see the fear in my body uh there it is and have begun to acknowledge and even

85
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:03,480
try to welcome met in response it's it insists uh louder and harder that it's

86
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,159
irresponsible for me to surrender not just on the macro level like with all

87
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:14,519
the horrors going on in the world in the US right now but also on some very deep

88
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:20,320
intuitive level it's dangerous for me I suspect this partly

89
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,480
stems from growing up in a chaotic and unsafe household being alert and aware

90
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,600
felt necessary for survival partly two it might be a culturally

91
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:36,559
female thing I am meant to be perpetually attentive to others moods

92
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,080
needs wishes and not tune out until after I've I've assured that everyone

93
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:49,960
else is fine anyway don't know if this warrants a darat but I would be grateful for any

94
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,120
teachings on working with this fear

95
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:04,720
Instinct so so let's start with the easy

96
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,600
part the the of my response not the easy part

97
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:19,799
but the easy part of my response around the gendered pressures of being a um

98
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:25,480
caretaker and what I thought of when I was we were

99
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:31,760
out to dinner with my parents last you know a few days ago and um our the

100
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:40,880
waitress had kind of large hoop earrings with some script uh written and um my mom sort of

101
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,039
caught caught her eye and um she asked the waitress you know what what your

102
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:54,279
what the script in your earrings says and uh waitress said smash the

103
00:32:54,279 --> 00:33:00,279
patriarchy and uh my dad was like okay okay fair

104
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:07,080
enough so Dharma pleasure that's

105
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:13,720
your Birthright as much as anyone

106
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:21,240
and it's not a kind of indulgence and your growing spiritual

107
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:27,799
power maybe uh you know is perhaps kind of doesn't feel Justified or is

108
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:33,919
intimidating to some but it's it's a good force in the

109
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:39,880
world and so okay fear yeah some part of

110
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:49,840
our mind to you know Stillness sadei surrender all of that is

111
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:58,000
dangerous you know anicha uncertainty means that we we don't know

112
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,600
and not knowing is um a very precarious position for an

113
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,720
animal not knowing is precarious because how could

114
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:19,480
we defend or manage or control that which is not

115
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:27,079
known and the priority as I often say in all virtually all moments is ensuring

116
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:32,398
more moments it's about Safety and Security and

117
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:42,240
security is about the future and a deep abiding preoccupation of what now means

118
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:49,599
for my future and so letting go as you suggest

119
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:57,760
does not come naturally to us it does not feel safe and when the Dharma teacher said

120
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:06,119
says casually just like oh just let go let go you know some part of us is like

121
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:12,599
really you're not actually serious that this is what you're asking like or maybe

122
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:18,920
it's different for you but that that's not safe clinging is what feels safe

123
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,880
thinking is what feels safe worrying is what feels safe pinging to

124
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,078
all of our familiar reference points is what feels

125
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:38,320
safe and you know our our Consciousness our

126
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,839
knowing is infused with this fear and

127
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:49,240
this vigilance and it's it's almost that's

128
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:56,200
what I was alluding to in those strange meditation instructions I'm not trying to be self-deprecating but they were

129
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:01,480
strange um what I was alluding to with the kind of

130
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:07,800
like potential energy of each moment the sense of like needs to be elaborated

131
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:18,880
upon need to know which way this can go and um and so that that infuses our

132
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:28,560
Consciousness and at different gateways to um like a deeper Stillness or Letting

133
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:36,000
Go it um it can feel like it's our job to do

134
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,560
more to do something to make something happen and um I'll Circle back to the

135
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:50,760
fear but that that at that Gateway it feels like okay I have to I got to do something now but doing something that

136
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,560
sense of willfulness is actually just more static

137
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:04,079
in these Realms you know when we get quiet in that way trying to do something

138
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,839
which is trying to be somebody that's more

139
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:17,680
static and many of these kind of like you know these gateways to into some

140
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:24,920
deeper intimacy deeper surrender deeper states of practice they're highly

141
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,520
attenuated self States know like the

142
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:37,040
ordinary sense of the control tower of preferences of judgments of agendas like

143
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:43,839
all of that is is thinned out otherwise we're not granted access to any kind of

144
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:50,920
Stillness and the sense of of Free Will of me like orchestrating this

145
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:58,640
thing me entering into something me um

146
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,720
you know choreographing my practice sense of of that control even

147
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:14,079
of the free sense of free will that gets thinned out and the pressure to uh to make

148
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,480
something happen is just more

149
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:26,040
contraction okay so the arising

150
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,359
of spirit ual vertigo

151
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:39,119
um sometimes comes when we're so accustomed to the somethingness of the

152
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:47,440
self the solidity of the self it's like um we've just grown so

153
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:54,640
accustomed to reiterating the the kind of story of

154
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,520
me that uh these attenuated self States they they are jarring right it feels

155
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:09,480
like it's like um we're standing at some kind of abyss and it's almost like I can't

156
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:16,520
really see where I fit in there that's

157
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:25,000
scary and sometimes at that Gateway that kind of doorway there might be fear yeah

158
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,800
but there is also craving and engine in and the craving needs to be

159
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,240
known clearly in Awareness

160
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:46,280
relas nothing actually needs to happen you know it feels like um I think

161
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:52,040
I think it was Jesse Vega fry who said like you know was describing a long retreat he said he was like had this

162
00:39:52,040 --> 00:40:01,000
sense of like like being right on the cusp of something you know he said like that's the worst you know on the cusp

163
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,599
you know but we do get to the cusp of some

164
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:14,160
things and um but the way we kind of enter is

165
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,200
um is by releasing the the need for anything to

166
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:29,280
happen the goodness unfolds from not needing anything to happen

167
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,480
sometimes when the fear comes up we we make the fear an object of practice as

168
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:45,000
as you're implying you know and so we're deconstructing the experience

169
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:52,240
of fear like okay what is this why do I call it fear I'm not disputing that but

170
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:59,240
why do I call it that what is its signature Body Mind

171
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:06,599
how can we know it as impermanent you know how do we know

172
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:12,680
it uh you know soothe it soothe it with

173
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:20,200
love sometimes we we simply need to go through that we need to like many times

174
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:27,079
we have to actually habituate so that the fear is kind of like old hat you know it's like oh yeah

175
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:34,079
yeah familiar with this get quiet then

176
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:42,480
Mara me whatever you want to however you want to language it there's the

177
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,520
fear sometimes uh you know once the fear is Arisen it's it's just it's already

178
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:56,000
too late you know uh that's okay too that's okay too

179
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,640
we're practicing such that spiritual vertigo is less likely to

180
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:14,040
arise and yeah I mean sometimes in the kind of

181
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:19,240
hyper plastic you know modes of deep

182
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:28,040
practice some of the the sort of most congealed self States rise up to meet

183
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:34,920
the kind of precipice of a Nat of not self that's that's that's uh that really

184
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:40,800
does happen you know it's like the Stillness and the quiet it makes love

185
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,079
much more accessible but also everything else much more accessible seems weird

186
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:54,119
you know but yeah Stillness can make hate more accessible make the most dense self

187
00:42:54,119 --> 00:43:01,800
States more accessible these are much more fluid Realms of

188
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:09,359
being okay so we're we this is sometimes there's something to do in the moment

189
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:14,680
sometimes it's this gradual training we don't have to perfectly heal

190
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:21,520
no one has perfect psychological health no one has no

191
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:27,640
scars but we're working so that our past is De electrif

192
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:35,760
ified and the pain of the past the pain of our life can it might still hurt but it can

193
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:45,119
no longer Ambush us ainus is no there no monsters

194
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:53,440
lurking sometimes the monster is uh mortality the the changing of all things

195
00:43:53,440 --> 00:44:01,720
the grief at the center of all things and so we let our heart acclimatize to that fact you

196
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:09,480
know um the fact that we we already know how every story

197
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:16,040
ends not always so Suzuki Ros she

198
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:24,839
said and so we we focus sometimes on the pleasant so

199
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:30,520
much feels uh really good and you know we just

200
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:37,119
marinate in that we get on a kind of positive feedback loop ah yeah very

201
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:43,760
pleasant bake that into your circuits feels good to be tranquil this is safe

202
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,720
this is a safe kind of pleasure this is a safe kind of

203
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:59,040
surrender and then um sometimes the the the only thing we

204
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,240
can entrust ourselves to is faith faith that the

205
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:10,400
darkness will not harm me faith that something

206
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:19,359
love will catch me and the sense that I'll be you know

207
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:25,480
I'll be harmed by this silence it's almost like the last breath of the

208
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:33,760
thawing self we surrender to dhma trust in the

209
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:42,480
