00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,600
hello and welcome and

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,679
one of the approaches to meditation always is to keep it very simple

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:21,279
with the idea that we are simplifying our preoccupation simplifying our what

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,000
we're caught up in simplifying ourselves in many ways so that

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,880
uh we're able to see our experience

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,039
free of the lenses of

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,879
pre-existing concepts we have we can see our experience without the filter of

8
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:55,440
ideas and preferences without the ideas of shoulds and shouldn't and without

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:03,840
expectation that we're simplifying to become fresh a fresh

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,400
awareness a fresh perspective a fresh seeing of our experience

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,680
even to the extent that it's at almost as if we're seeing for the first time

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:26,439
seeing for the first time and in doing so find it phenomenally interesting

13
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,759
amazing wondrous be and that we're curious interested in

14
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:40,159
knowing what is here as if we've never known it before

15
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,040
even something as simple as the breathing

16
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,360
but the emphasis is on the process of simplification

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,200
not the process of seeing at least in the beginning

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:05,399
so assuming a posture of meditation that's right for you

19
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,440
uh and to

20
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:22,319
think of the posture as an invitation to become simply here

21
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,040
to be grounded here to be settled here

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,440
and the way that the posture could help is by assuming a posture

23
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:47,239
that allows you to somehow have both an alertness

24
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:55,000
and an opportunity to relax the larger muscles of your body

25
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,080
maybe on the inhale to feel

26
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,599
the vitality the aliveness the alertness

27
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,959
that's in the body itself

28
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:25,720
and on the exhale to relax the body the shoulders the belly the face

29
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,120
and to breathing in

30
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,480
a simplicity of being

31
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:15,319
breathing out relaxing into a simplicity of being here

32
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,440
with whatever is here for you

33
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,600
not wanting it to be different not wanting it to stay the same

34
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,280
just here with this

35
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,479
breathing with it

36
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,360
and it can be complicated to be present if the mind is quick to judge and

37
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,879
comment and analyze

38
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:08,680
as you exhale softening relaxing the thinking mind

39
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,960
gently quieting your thoughts

40
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,639
and then settling into the simplicity of breathing

41
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:18,319
or the simplicity of accompanying breathing

42
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:25,280
and awareness accompanies breathing closely

43
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,720
breathing accompanies awareness

44
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:40,840
like two friends walking contentedly in a park together

45
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:51,360
so breathing and awareness content contentedly accompany each other

46
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,440
within the world of our experience

47
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,440
and if you would like in order to stay with

48
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:22,240
the changing rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

49
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,479
you can gently count your breaths one to three

50
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,360
or one to 10

51
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:43,080
very very soft count very relaxed calm count

52
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,680
and part of the function of the counting is to help you notice

53
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,759
when you wander off from the count into your thoughts

54
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,160
and then gently calmly begin again

55
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:15,240
the simplicity of being centered on the body breathing

56
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,120
Each time you exhale

57
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,320
to settle into a simplicity of being

58
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,480
a stability of just being Here

59
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:43,480
in the midst of your present moment embodied experience

60
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,399
relaxing the thinking mind

61
00:13:52,959 --> 00:14:01,399
the only thing you have to think about is the breathing itself

62
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:09,320
accompanying The rhythm of breathing

63
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,200
as we continue sitting

64
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,880
feeling into

65
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:22,559
the way to a simplicity of being and how you can for a few more minutes

66
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,960
just be here in the simplest possible way

67
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,639
with your present moment experience

68
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:50,600
and noticing how with a shifting changing

69
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,919
river of change of here and now

70
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:08,720
there is very little orientation towards thoughts of me

71
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:16,880
myself and mine stories of self commentary about self

72
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:24,519
because those take you away from simple presence

73
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:33,480
can you feel see recognize

74
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,320
how the simplicity of being

75
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:55,960
stays free of the major preoccupations of self

76
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,520
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

77
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:43,360
consider when and how simplicity of presence simplicity of

78
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:50,880
being when offered to others

79
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:58,080
is a gift someone who is troubled

80
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,520
someone who is challenged in some deep way

81
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,360
who doesn't need someone to fix them or explain things to them

82
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:16,000
they just value being accompanied by someone who can be simple relaxed

83
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,520
someone who can be present for them

84
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,080
where a simplicity of being

85
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,000
provides the right level of accompanyment

86
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:48,960
or when a simplicity of being is the appropriate way of accompanying

87
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,960
yourself

88
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:06,480
where a simplicity of being can allow for a simple good will

89
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,320
a simple care and kindness

90
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:21,480
that gently non assertively without expectation

91
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,240
has goodwill for self and others

92
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,399
wishing lightly openly

93
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,480
may all beings be happy

94
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,960
may all beings be safe

95
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,039
may all beings be peaceful

96
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,559
may all beings be free

97
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:24,919
[Music]

98
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,360
thank you

99
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,200
so hello from Insight Meditation Center here in Redwood City

100
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,600
happy to continue this series on uh the topic of insight

101
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,880
the insight of insight meditation and currently

102
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:58,640
the topic is the insight into inconstancy the instight into change

103
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:06,320
and it's not a difficult insight maybe it's almost too obvious that

104
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,919
things change and that things are not the same

105
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:18,399
but uh still we get caught in permanence we get caught in that kind of believing

106
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:25,760
this is the way it is and uh to

107
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:31,520
come to freedom in Buddhism a kind of a deep inner freedom is to we're supported

108
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:39,760
by staying close to or recognizing in a deep way in a or to say differently not

109
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,519
uh in a continuous way how continuously

110
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:52,240
things are changing and it's almost as if or it is like that if we see change

111
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:59,039
we realize deeply we can't cling to anything because as soon as we cling

112
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:05,360
it's like clinging to uh the um the current of a river you put your hand

113
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:13,039
into that current you're going to grab that current grab that water hold on tight and you come up empty-handed it

114
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:21,360
might be a few drops of water on your hand but the current is not amenable to being grabbed and the water just goes

115
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:29,440
out your your hands and but some people are constantly grabbing grabbing grabbing or they're grabbing within the

116
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:36,720
current thinking they have it and so to begin seeing and feeling the

117
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,840
distinction between being in the flow of change and somehow being separated from

118
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,200
it or trying to hold on to something and one of those things concepts ideas that

119
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,200
takes us out really far out of the the the flow of the river of the present

120
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,320
moment is ideas concepts attachments to

121
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:06,080
self independent of whether there is a self or not a self

122
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,720
in a practical way we can get attached to self we can hold on to the self

123
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:20,000
and it becomes um a trap that takes us out of staying in the changing flow of

124
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:30,159
the present moment in the fluidity of the present staying fluid and moving with it and uh and knowing how to be

125
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:37,440
safe knowing how to be uh find a peace in the current of the river

126
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,960
and so uh I've gone rafting and and one of the ways to get trapped to get caught

127
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,240
a little bit sometimes rafting is to get pulled into the eddies usually on the

128
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,840
side of the river an eddy is aware place where the current of water flowing

129
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,519
somehow gets um pushed off maybe the the bottom or the usually the sides of the

130
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,880
river in such a way that part of the current flows backwards and up river to

131
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:11,440
be then pushed down again and it can go in a circle a little bit like a whirlpool but there's the water is not

132
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,638
being pulled down so it just kind of it's moving around in a circle and the

133
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:23,200
raft can get stuck there some eddies can be quite strong and some are somewhat large

134
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:30,320
and um and you can kind of stuck in there every time you try to come out of the EV eddy you're come into where the

135
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:38,560
current is most strongly going to pull push you down back into it and around and around and um and so the

136
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:45,200
preoccupation with self is an eddy it's a has a gravitational force that pulls

137
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:52,878
us into it so if I have this idea that I'm a bad meditator or a good meditator

138
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,880
that's an abstract idea but it's an abstract idea about me i am

139
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,640
something and anything about me is interesting anything about me that's

140
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,920
praise or blame is even more interesting and so there's a pull into that world

141
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,680
there's emotions and feelings that are produced by it there's uh concerns and

142
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:23,200
anxiety produced by those thoughts there's ways and we get pulled into that eddy and even if we try to come out of

143
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:29,280
it the force just pulls us back in and we circle and circle and the river is

144
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,040
just a few few feet away keeps flowing it's constantly the water is flowing and

145
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:40,160
flowing but now we're stuck in this eddy going around and around

146
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,440
and um and and when we try to get out of it towards the edge of it it can feel

147
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:52,720
it's it gets harder and harder to kind of pull up because there the current the the the force of the eddi is strongest

148
00:35:52,720 --> 00:36:00,480
and um but if we can get free of the eddi then there's the freedom the delight of now

149
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,920
being uh being uh in the flow of the current of the river being carried by it

150
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,839
nicely and then not a lot of rowing is needed or paddling is needed because now

151
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:19,040
we're kind of in the flow we just have to stay in it and we might from the point of view of the in the being in the

152
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,160
current come close to an eddi but we can see it and we keep ourselves away from

153
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,480
it we know the danger there so there's a lot of way that selfing is one of those

154
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,520
concepts that we get caught in permanence get caught in this is how

155
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,440
things are and when we're really caught in it then uh we're actually

156
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,280
disconnected to the simplicity of life the current kind of flow and unfolding

157
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,599
of life and it can be quite intense the entities we go into where we leak uh the

158
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,880
the the ideas of self the self-concepts we caught in are not just simple ideas

159
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:07,200
like I'm a good meditator I'm a bad meditator but it gets pulled into the world of of uh fantasize imagination

160
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:15,520
story making I start imagining that I'm going to go off to some beautiful

161
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:22,400
natural place and that's what it's going to take for me to be a good meditator where there's peace and serenity and and

162
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,320
I imagine the birds singing and how there'll be people coming and delivering wonderful

163
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:34,720
uh drinks to me smoothies and and um and it'll just be kind of so comfortable at

164
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:42,000
temperature and I'm lost in a fantasy this fantasy that's centered on me myself and mine that's more and more

165
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,119
disconnected what's sad is when those fantasies are

166
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:53,680
negative in nature i'm a bad meditator and therefore everyone will hate me and I can't go to meditation centers because

167
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,119
I go to a meditation center and meditate other people they're going to see I'm a bad meditator and they'll want to reject

168
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:07,280
me or they'll laugh at me and and we start imagining all these things actually happening and the imagination

169
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,680
affects our emotions almost as as strongly as if it's really happening and we're caught in that eddy and it's hard

170
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:20,960
to get out of it um but if we know if we have some deep

171
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:28,160
understanding deep insight deep ability to connect to the flow of

172
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,640
the present moment the changing nature everything is in constant everything is changing including our thoughts and

173
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,240
emotions so we don't get caught in it so we're not in the eddi but we're in the

174
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,720
current that flows down river we just stay in there being carried along

175
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:53,359
then we're less likely to be tricked fooled by these concepts of self we're

176
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:59,280
be able to better see the concept selves are a little bit like or very much like

177
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,960
grabbing on to something and holding on and sometimes it's not like an eddy but

178
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,920
you you can't actually hang on to it but you can get caught in its flow sometimes

179
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:19,440
that what keeps us caught is that um we're still tied to the pier or there's

180
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:26,480
the anchor hasn't been pulled up and the self is that strong that solid

181
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,000
and um and it isn't that we have to deny that there is a self

182
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:41,280
at this point in practice there's never any denial um but we see more and more how concepts

183
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:48,800
ideas of self are pulling us away from the being fluid being

184
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:57,599
in the flow being somehow adaptable or the somehow kind of appreciating the

185
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:04,240
lived life of the present moment as it unfolds and changes and shifts in the

186
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:13,359
present moment and at first this present moment simplicity of being can seem boring too

187
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:20,000
simple it's much less sophisticated than the elaborate

188
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,560
thoughts fantasies ideas about self and what's I'm doing for myself and what I'll

189
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,560
accomplish and what I'll prove and how great I'll be um but over time we begin

190
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:39,359
realizing that the eddy of self is kind of very itself very impoverished

191
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,599
very limiting and that the three-dimensional the multi-dimensional

192
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:52,240
richness of human life has so much there in the simplicity of being because it's

193
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:59,119
in the simplicity of being that we have we can connect to the deep sensitivities

194
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,480
the deep sensitivities activities of the heart of our inner life to ourselves to

195
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:11,839
others that that's where something comes alive that is freeing that is satisfying

196
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:18,079
that's wise and caring so part of the emphasis on the insight

197
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:25,119
into inconstancy and change is to help us support us from being caught in the

198
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,480
eddies of self so as you go by go through your day

199
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:37,119
today you might look at this you might consider you might try to notice when you get

200
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:45,040
involved in the swirl of thoughts ideas stories that

201
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,079
are centered on me myself and mine somehow you're the prime character in

202
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:57,440
your thoughts and ideas or the or the your emotions are the primary fuel

203
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:04,720
um for thinking about other people even and uh and how it takes you out of

204
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,480
something it this connects you to something that if you were connected to

205
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,880
would actually give you a much better ability to be wise to be present and to

206
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,160
be caring for the whole world

207
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:29,040
so um may your simplicity of being

208
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:35,640
be a gift you give to this world thank you
