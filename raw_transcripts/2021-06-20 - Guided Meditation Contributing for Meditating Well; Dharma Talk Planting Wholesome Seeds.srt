00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:11,599
so good day everyone and welcome to our sunday morning meditation

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,800
and um meditation practice is supported or helped

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,240
by our contributions to it instead of just sitting quietly and

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:32,719
expecting just to reap the benefits of quiet sitting it might be helpful to think of

5
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,480
a few things that we contribute to allow the meditation to unfold

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,920
and so we contribute non-hostility and non

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,199
aversion to what's happening to our experience we contribute a non-greed

8
00:00:53,199 --> 00:01:01,199
the absence of greedy expectation or desire for something or

9
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,680
we contribute to we contribute non-delusion not getting caught up in

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:16,720
delusions of grandeur or fantasies or or all kinds of

11
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:26,479
abstract removed thinking that has nothing to do with the simplicity of the immediacy of right here

12
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:35,920
and so we make we contribute something and and non-hostility

13
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,079
is comparable to was related to offering

14
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:49,360
some degree of simple ordinary kindness goodwill friendliness

15
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:55,280
non-greed is offering associated with offering some very

16
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,360
simple ordinary

17
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,960
generosity being generous to what the experience is

18
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,680
and non-delusion is associated with the field of wisdom

19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:22,080
to bring forth whatever wise understanding we have that supports us to or encourages us to

20
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,239
stay right here be here

21
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,200
so we make simple contributions

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:42,160
so assuming a meditation posture where you are upright

23
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,160
either literally or metaphorically in a posture that supports you to be

24
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,640
both comfortable and alert

25
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,840
closing your eyes that's comfortable for you

26
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:21,360
and then settling into your posture kind of becoming aware of your body

27
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,640
and if there's ways that you can relax and settle your body

28
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:37,440
soften ease into this human form that we have

29
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,840
perhaps taking a few long slow deep breaths

30
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,920
in the exhale stretching the torso to the edges of how

31
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,840
big this torso can become

32
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:15,840
perhaps a stretching

33
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,840
and letting your breathing return to normal

34
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:43,840
and on the exhale scan through your body relaxing those parts of the body

35
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:57,840
where there might be holding in tension

36
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:35,759
and then settling down into your body and is there some place in your body

37
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,919
that you associate with non-greed

38
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,240
the absence of any strong driven desire

39
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,039
may be a place of generosity here openness

40
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,759
and if there is such a place in your body breathe with it for a few moments

41
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:21,840
breathe through it connecting yourself to non-greed

42
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,880
is there any place in your body that you associate with non-ill will

43
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:52,638
the absence of hostility a place of peace of good will

44
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,599
maybe of contentment and to breathe with this part of your

45
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:10,080
body breathe through it grounding yourself in

46
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:17,840
non-ill will

47
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,639
and is there a place in your body that you associate with non-delusion

48
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:45,840
someplace in your body that feels at rest or relaxed when there is wisdom

49
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
understanding

50
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,879
and perhaps as we sit this meditation

51
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:29,080
in a gentle easy simple way maybe non-greed non-ill will

52
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:35,839
non-delusion can be a soft gentle

53
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,839
support and inspiration

54
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,360
for your present moment mindfulness for staying alert and present

55
00:08:49,360 --> 00:09:09,839
moment by moment here breathing in and breathing out

56
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
um

57
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:47,120
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

58
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,240
what might how might you be at the end of a

59
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,640
meditation that supports non-greed

60
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,399
non-ill will non-delusion

61
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:15,840
how might you be at the end of meditation that feels like almost like a natural support

62
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:23,519
not complicated and not a lot of thinking is there something about simplicity of

63
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,840
being or being calm settled

64
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:37,120
being more mindful that supports

65
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:57,840
being alive without being caught in greed or ill will delusion

66
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:11,840
and may it be that how we meditate that the practice that we do that the

67
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:18,480
fruits of that this practice may it be that it's something we can share with

68
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,120
the world share in intentional and unintentional

69
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:32,640
ways knowing and unknowing ways share it not because we proselytize for

70
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:39,679
sure but share it just by the way we are in the world

71
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:47,360
may we live in the world with generosity and love and wisdom

72
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:55,279
and in doing so contributing to the good conditions that support other

73
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:02,799
people to be happy and free and peaceful

74
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:11,838
and safe may this meditation practice that we do

75
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,480
help someone today for the next 24 hours

76
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:27,520
to feel safe safer to feel more peaceful or at ease

77
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,679
to feel happier

78
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:42,079
and to feel like they can live with breathing more freely

79
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:49,838
their heart beating more freely their mind

80
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,280
freed from contractions constrictions preoccupation

81
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,359
may all beings be happy and peaceful and safe and free

82
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:16,070
and may we support that possibility

83
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:19,359

98
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,440
to support the the widespread community of people who

99
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:16,400
have been participating this last year on zoom and youtube and it's on our minds

100
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,320
the other thing is that in a few weeks i think around the 10th of uh maybe 10th and

101
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,240
11th of july friday saturday and sunday

102
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:36,320
there's a dharma teacher a wonderful vipassana teacher gregory kramer who is one of the more

103
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:42,560
innovative and brilliant teacher innovating a lot of the application of

104
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:49,200
the dharma application of mindfulness into the rest of our life outside of

105
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,880
meditation he developed a whole practice called insight dialogue

106
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:01,280
to bring mindfulness into talking

107
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:08,960
in our conversations with people and he's written a book now called i think the whole path the whole life

108
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:16,320
the whole life whole life practice or the whole life dharma forget exactly the title but but he has a term the whole life and

109
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,520
uh he explores the eightfold path in this book uh addressing very well many of the

110
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:28,079
issues how to live the dharma in our whole life and uh

111
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,560
he's offered to come down come down he's offered on zoom for our community to offer uh

112
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,240
kind of a creative teaching and uh kind of a retreat over this

113
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,680
weekend at least that weekend in july where he'll offer teachings and

114
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:53,040
and practices on his whole life dharma approach and with lots of time

115
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,200
during the day to go about your life your daily life and to um practice with it and then

116
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:05,040
he'll have offer support through the day and i think the main meetings are in the morning in the late afternoon

117
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,800
um and then practicing on your life in your life with it so i feel very fortunate to have him

118
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,720
coming and i encourage many of you to come if you're interested and there's more information about it on

119
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,480
imc website and i believe the easiest place to find it is on the what's new

120
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,520
section on the bottom right of the home page but also if you look under programs

121
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,119
it's listed there as well and you have to register for it

122
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:39,280
so gregory kramer the whole life

123
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,040
path or the whole life dharma so something like that is this uh book

124
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:53,119
so yeah i see it in the chat there were several

125
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,240
happy father's day wishes to spend out and certainly

126
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,319
to all the fathers and a few weeks ago had mothers and

127
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:12,640
all the parents who listening to us may you be um

128
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:21,838
may you be honored and respected and appreciated for all that you do and have done

129
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:29,119
also this weekend many of us in the united

130
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:37,920
states are celebrating this new holiday we now have juneteenth day the 19th of june and

131
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,920
i think it's been already become my favorite holiday in the united states

132
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,680
i i kind of liked in principle the idea of fourth of july for being an independence day it seemed like

133
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:57,119
closely related to the buddhist idea of freedom but liberation but juntinte is much more

134
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:04,000
closely related in my mind to this and maybe this can be a holiday that we buddhists united

135
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,960
states might want to particularly cherish um it's not it's not it's interesting

136
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,240
it's not really the celebration of the of the particular day that the

137
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,839
immense immense emancipation proclamation when slaves were in a sense liberated united

138
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:28,560
states but rather represents today that um in texas in a particular town in texas i

139
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:36,560
think galveston where many months after the proclamation was declared the slaves

140
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:42,240
there learned that they were free in other words the locals didn't want to tell them that they were free and

141
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:49,280
it took that long to discover and so it's the kind of the last

142
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:56,319
of the slaves who discovered that they were actually liberated and and so to celebrate this

143
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:03,359
very important milestone in this in this country it seems like a celebrate to appreciate to honor to

144
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:09,359
remember seems like a very important thing to do and the fact that the liberation from slavery is a much

145
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:16,160
bigger liberation than from uh political control of england the united states where lots of the

146
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,280
people who were so-called received their independence from england

147
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:28,400
had a lot of freedom that this lots of freedom compared to what slaves had but to have this liberation from slavery

148
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:36,000
it's a you know much bigger one in and and to appreciate how important it is

149
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,280
and to feel the poignancy or the the pain the fact that the delayed notification of some slaves and how

150
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,359
difficult you know the freedom from slavery actually was and and how even being freed from slave

151
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:54,720
there was still kind of the remnants of that oppression uh

152
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,480
continues continues to this day in the united states the repercussions

153
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,920
of all that so that leads to the topic for today

154
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:12,480
which is um has a little bit to do with the buddhist teachings on karma

155
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,800
but i think rather than particularly focus on buddhism so much it's like actually i think a

156
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:25,680
wide ranging teaching in many religions that sometimes summarize with a little

157
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,359
phrase you you reap what you sow

158
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:38,960
and in that or say differently that um

159
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,560
what we do plant seeds that will come to fruition

160
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:52,160
and and those seeds the quality or the characteristics of those seeds affects the plant that grows

161
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:58,880
and the fruit that comes and so seeds or activities the actions

162
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:06,319
that we do that are unwholesome will produce unwholesome fruit those which

163
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:13,680
are wholesome produce wholesome fruit and the

164
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:23,040
the um and in this in plenty of places including in buddhism

165
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:30,400
it seemed to be kind of a fundamental law that this is how things work in this world and whether it's that fundamental

166
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,760
and works all the way all the time this way it works a lot of times this way and we see

167
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:42,319
result we see this over and over and over and over again and in some ways the tremendous

168
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:47,680
unwholesomeness of slavery which um

169
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:54,800
you know it says that it used the word on wholesome here just seems almost i don't know just

170
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:03,359
you know just seems like it's belittling it almost but the almost the evil of slavery

171
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:09,040
is um um the actions of the people you know 200

172
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:15,040
years ago 150 years ago however long it was that all these centuries of slavery in this

173
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:21,760
on this continent that a tremendous unwholesomeness

174
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:27,200
set in motion a whole series of fruits whole series of conditions whole

175
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:35,599
series of things that are rippling through our societies to this day that uh we are the recipients

176
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:43,040
of this bitter fruit that was been pla of seeds that were planted in this

177
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:48,400
soil you know for centuries with slavery and we're still contending with it and

178
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:55,440
dealing with it in so many different ways so we have a very clear example of this

179
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:02,240
and it doesn't necessarily mean that all the fruits that are produced by the

180
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:08,640
seeds that we do are limited to affecting ourselves sometimes in the buddhist karma teaching

181
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:15,520
the idea is that you will you will reap the fruit of the seeds that you plant

182
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:21,760
but i think that i find it very helpful to separate out you know it from being so personal because the

183
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:27,760
effect of what we do spreads out beyond us and sometimes the impact around us is bigger than

184
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:33,280
the maybe the impact we experience in ourselves but to be the caretakers of the seeds

185
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,400
that we plant to be very careful with the what we do

186
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:44,960
so that what we do is not planting not planting unwholesome seeds

187
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:51,920
but rather planting wholesome seeds and it's presented in almost like as a law that if you do

188
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,680
something unwholesome it will produce unwholesome fruit

189
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,880
if you do something wholesome it will produce wholesome fruit

190
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:09,599
psychologically we can see that in ourselves that sometimes we can see that very clearly and the

191
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,880
if we do unwholesome things that certainly it set up sets up conditions

192
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,920
that supports more on wholesomeness sometimes if we spend a lot of time

193
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:26,800
being mean angry critical hostile to others

194
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,640
they start to act and behave around us in a way that starts being uncomfortable for us

195
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:39,920
and that discomfort that social discomfort that maybe being ignored or not addressed or something

196
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:46,000
is painful and some of this unwholesomeness that people

197
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,680
live within the world is a result of the pain they feel

198
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,559
the so much so that sometimes i've heard this kind of karma kind of principle be that if you

199
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:06,400
act out of pain it produces more pain if you act out of out of non-pain or out

200
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:14,319
of happiness you produce more happiness and so to some you know and so when the

201
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:21,280
cycles there's cycles of unwholesomeness where unwholesomeness produces more wholesome conditions and those unhelpful

202
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:27,760
conditions are make it easier to act on wholesomely and that produces more conditions and so

203
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:33,200
this is this cycle of self-perpetuating unwholesomeness that can go on

204
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,559
not only for an individual for a lifetime but also gets passed on to generation

205
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:44,000
generation of people that uh where there's a tremendous

206
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,839
sometimes hostility anger even violence and families and people kids growing up

207
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:55,920
now they learn that that's what you do and that's the kind of learned behavior and they grow up to be adults and they

208
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:03,680
continue it and they pass it on to their children and and you see we see it that both in

209
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:10,640
oneself that the causing suffering in the world is a causes conditions for further

210
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:17,760
distress further pain further discomfort and pain is a primary condition why

211
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,119
people do things in unwholesome way unskillful way

212
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,880
and so buddhist practice is a practice to interrupt the cycles of

213
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,400
unwholesomeness to not perpetuate that

214
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,520
and it's remarkable that what meditation can how meditation functions in that

215
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:45,760
to sit down and meditate and be still and be quiet and just focus on your breath

216
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:54,000
is a not such a simple passive practice when the mind stream

217
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,160
has all this momentum of uh thinking certain ways attitude certain

218
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:06,480
ways of of anger hostility greed uh

219
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:12,079
um delusion and um and just kind of

220
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:18,079
you can feel the power of that's the cycles of that kind of thinking sometimes and there's attitudes those desires

221
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:26,480
when we sit down to meditate and then simply just come back to the breathing is an interruption in that mindstream

222
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:32,160
and maybe it's an interruption that lasts only a millisecond before we have to do it again and again

223
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:37,760
we get pulled away but we're beginning to interrupt the cycles to stop the cycles getting off

224
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:43,040
the wheel of this unwholesome unwholesome actions

225
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:48,640
produce the conditions for further unwholesome conditions

226
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:56,000
and um the um the um

227
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:02,240
and so we interrupt it but we can do better than just interrupting and stopping it

228
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:09,040
it's also possible to plant the seeds of the wholesome to plant seeds for happiness for

229
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:14,079
well-being for health and things that are done

230
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:20,480
in a healthy way produce more health usually if we plant seeds for happiness

231
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:29,680
it produces more happiness that the actions that we do

232
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:35,520
whether it's actions of thought actions of speech or actions of our body

233
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:42,240
that there's a way in which they can produce more of the same so unwholesomeness produces more

234
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,520
unwholesomeness wholesomeness produces more wholesomeness

235
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:53,359
and and the challenge here or what's fascinating i think is

236
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:58,559
sometimes we find ourselves that it's easier to do the unwholesome

237
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:05,599
than it is to do the wholesome it's easier sometimes to be angry than to figure out how to address a

238
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,800
situation um in in a way that's peaceful or kind

239
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:17,680
that's still effective easier to be short-sighted

240
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:23,359
about the impact we have right now and anger sometimes is to stop something

241
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:31,359
that we see that we want to you know you know push something away or have an impact right now on something

242
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:38,800
that this oftentimes the unwholesome behavior is short-sighted more often than not i would suggest

243
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:44,079
whereas the doing the wholesome can feel like a lot more effort and work is

244
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:50,160
needed it takes a little bit more reflection and thinking and

245
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:56,800
ending the mindstreams of unwholesomeness and and so if you're lazy it's just something easier just to go ahead and do

246
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:02,720
the unwholesome if we want to get immediate results

247
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:10,720
on wholesomeness maybe it can do that but the to do the wholesome routes

248
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:18,079
takes a little bit more effort initially it might take more effort to look for kind of delayed

249
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:24,000
gratification understanding how to be wise in a wholesome way in a

250
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,640
kind supportive way and non-greed non-hatred

251
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:34,720
but as we practice and we start being in touch with

252
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:41,520
non-greed and non-hatred and non-delusion inside of us as a kind of a almost like a place or a

253
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:46,559
clarity or a purity or an openness or a peacefulness

254
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:54,400
then it becomes easier and easier to be that way and we start seeing that to act with

255
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:02,079
unwholesomeness is a kind of instant karma where the unwholesome itself

256
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:09,040
is hurts ouch whereas to act on the wholesome it feels

257
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:15,359
good it's an ah so here's the principle in very simple

258
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:21,359
language if we do something that has an ouch in it

259
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:28,880
it's going to produce more ouch if we do something it has an ah in it chances are it'll produce more

260
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:34,319
ah and so even though it might take more

261
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:42,319
work initially to do the wholesome the healthy that which comes from the best part of who we are

262
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:49,680
it's a training we're doing we're beginning to open the door that might be rusted shut the hinges are rusted and

263
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:55,440
tight and we're beginning to open it and discovering and opening the store and the heart

264
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:01,040
so that the the wholesomeness begins becomes second nature or becomes a place

265
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:08,559
that we act on and live on from the world and we start feeling that this is what's easy to do the

266
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:14,240
unwholesome is actually more stressful more difficult in its own way

267
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:19,520
and um and so we choose the easy route to live a

268
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:25,599
wholesome ways so initially it seems like the unwholesome can be easier

269
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:32,000
but over time the wholesome becomes easier and and the advantage of the

270
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,400
of the wholesome uh it doesn't uh produce the same

271
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:46,400
levels of difficulty in a life the after effect of wholesomeness

272
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:53,839
there's no cleanup that has to be done there's no retribution there's no people being

273
00:56:53,839 --> 00:57:00,079
angry back at us and perpetuating the cycles whereas if we do unwholesome

274
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:05,920
we have to explain ourselves we have to apologize we have to defend ourselves we have to escape we have to shut down

275
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:11,200
we have to ignore we it's all this kind of secondary tertiary behavior

276
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,559
that comes out of the unwholesome that doesn't come out of the wholesome

277
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:22,960
so to live a simpler life a cleaner life by tuning into what is wholesome

278
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:29,119
so this distinction between wholesome and unwholesome is really key to the whole buddhist

279
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:36,559
practice and to begin understanding what this means and more importantly how to recognize it

280
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:42,480
in ourselves how to recognize the healthy feeling

281
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:51,200
of the wholesome and the unhealthy feeling of the unwholesome how to recognize

282
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:57,280
uh that we're planting seeds and we want to be careful with the seeds that we plant

283
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:04,960
and we plant the seeds through our actions and the quality of our actions if as the

284
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,838
has is the particular plant that we're planting

285
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:16,590
so we want to be careful with our actions and careful means

286
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:24,799
[Music] bring use your capacity for choice

287
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:31,359
to choose what you should do don't live a life that doesn't use this

288
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:36,720
tremendous gift that we're given that we can choose between we can choose

289
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:43,920
what we do and what we say don't live a life that doesn't have the simplest self-reflection

290
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:50,160
of being wise and aware of what we're going to say and do before we do

291
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:57,839
the and this is one of the uh

292
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:04,000
reasons to practice mindfulness that the more mindfulness we have the more

293
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:11,920
there is space in the mind the more there's almost like a pause in which we can see

294
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,359
where the moment of choice is and if we can see that moment of choice

295
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:23,359
to choose the wholesome and if we don't know what the wholesome thing is to do

296
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:30,839
then it's all it's generally quite wholesome to avoid the unwholesome that's enough

297
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:38,079
sometimes you don't have to make it more complicated than that or it's wholesome to say

298
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:43,520
pause and say you know i need to think about that or can we kind of just kind of let it

299
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:49,760
sit for a while as i reflect on this and can we take a time out so i can just be with myself a little bit

300
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,680
before i respond to this difficult conversation we're having that there are unwholesome response

301
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:00,799
there are there are wholesome responses that don't mean we understand how to be

302
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:08,079
kind or generous or loving but we know something else maybe the choice is to be more mindful

303
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:15,040
to be more present and really listen more deeply to ourselves and to what's going on around us

304
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:23,200
but mindfulness as mindfulness begins to take hold of our life we begin to have that space

305
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:30,400
where we can see there's more and more choice and if you see your choice then

306
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:38,240
you begin exercising your freedom the freedom to live wholesomely

307
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:45,680
and you certainly you have a certain freedom to live in unhealth life however if you live unwholesomely

308
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:51,760
you're actually in bondage you're actually caught in the grip of things like greed and

309
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:59,280
hatred and delusion and unholsum un-wholesome is not the place of freedom it's the opposite

310
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:05,760
and so to see the place of choice and see where the freedom is to do the

311
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:12,400
wholesome this is the path of the dharma this

312
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:21,200
so you might want to carry with you this little nugget of wisdom little phrase

313
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:26,318
that what you do

314
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:38,799
everything you do is planting a seed for a plant that will come to fruition

315
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:46,160
so if you act in ways if the if in acting there's an

316
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:52,640
ouch chances are you'll produce more ouch if the way you act has an eye in it that

317
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:57,839
feels healthy and good you probably have an ah plant and the

318
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:06,400
fruit of it will be uh somewhere in the world maybe for you or maybe for others

319
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:14,400
