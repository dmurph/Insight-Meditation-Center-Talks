1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:08,280
so here we are on gathering together again this is 7:00 Pacific

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,799
time and so this week uh the meditation and as I was indicating in

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,960
the last couple of days uh were building um upon a metaphor I

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:30,720
used uh that sitting like a mountain and uh the first day uh we were

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,520
uh just using this metaphor as a way for us to uh let the Earth element the

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,680
earthy body resting on Earth and

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:49,559
um to allow ourselves to feel a sense of grounding gathered

8
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:57,840
collectedness and then yesterday I uh kind of expanded uh a little bit of this

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,640
metaphor uh to include uh the breath kind of this mountain within the Earthly

10
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,320
body within has a liveness to it has a a

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:20,960
breath with us this is a life breath that enlivens us and so um they used the

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,240
metaphor as the breathing mountain and today we'll expand to

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,000
include even more dimensions of our being and this a live being

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,840
has you know the body physical physicality of the body our emotions and

15
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,119
Minds kind of like an entire living ecosystem you know the like the mountain

16
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:53,159
the forest the animals and it's a whole system and that's the nature within too

17
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,880
and so that's what we'll be meditating with today and so I'll begin with the

18
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,840
sound of a bell

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,680
[Music]

20
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,880
let the sound of the Bell fade

21
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:31,840
[Music] arriving arriving at a Here and Now

22
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:42,120
maybe a sense of a coming home to this body mind and

23
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:57,800
heart maybe it's a kind of a familiar feeling for you to come

24
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:06,120
home here in this body just how it

25
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,159
is not demanding for it to be

26
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,360
otherwise just receiving kindly

27
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:45,640
if it's a helpful you can do a global scan of the

28
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:53,360
body [Music] inviting any slight relaxation and

29
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,879
ease that's available to you

30
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,280
from the bottom of the feet all the way to the top of the

31
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,639
head relaxing

32
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,839
and [Music]

33
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,600
softening if that's available to us

34
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,918
one moment of mindfulness at a time

35
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,080
Moment by

36
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,919
moment you can begin to feel a sense of

37
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,198
presence more steady

38
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,800
the weight of the body settling down

39
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,599
naturally and the Torso naturally uplifts

40
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,039
allowing this earthy body resting on

41
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,160
Earth sitting like a mountain

42
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,520
grounded quiet

43
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,319
still to whatever degree that's available to you

44
00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:01,440
the movement of the breath naturally gets a highlight

45
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,240
Ed a breathing

46
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,120
Mountain a life Mountain

47
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:31,120
within feeling Sensations dancing in the body

48
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,599
vibrating tingling

49
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,000
you may also notice other elements in the

50
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,240
body the

51
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,920

52
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,760
feeling like The Mists in the mountain

53
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,560
there may be emotions waves of

54
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:52,800
emotions like a weather system in the mountain

55
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:14,360
open to receive feel and

56
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:21,040
sense this entire ecosystem Within

57
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,000

ecosystem aive Mountain

94
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:40,120

sound weather systems

97
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,880
is there a kind of a wakefulness

98
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,528
here [Music]

99
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:41,559
now in this nature

100
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:49,840
within in the Dharma of your own being

101
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,880
there may be natural heart responses to

102
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,360
this kind of

103
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,760
tenderness a kind of a care

104
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,960
Wonder

105
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,039
gratitude for

106
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:51,480
there a possibility of a simply being

107
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:59,480
here aware wake

108
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:06,840
for and Alive may be enough

109
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:23,929
[Music]

110
00:31:53,639 --> 00:32:00,159
I feel quite quiet with in and be feeling a kind of a quiet from

111
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:08,639
all all of you also in this last a few days we been uh

112
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:17,720
exploring the different aspects of refuge and started with refuge in

113
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:26,080
Nang refuge in Dharma and today uh we'll explore incorporating The

114
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,720
Refuge in the Buddha and as some of you would know this is

115
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:37,360
the this three um forms the kind of

116
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:45,080
triple Jam you know that's a uh something that often referred to in the

117
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:52,120
in the reverse order triple Jam of the Buddha Dharma and

118
00:32:54,120 --> 00:33:02,200
Sana so refuge in Buddha has an ancient root uh in poly Canan

119
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:09,880
text we often find the words um that I go to the Buddha for

120
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:16,000
refuge and it feels like it maybe makes sense for those who lived um in the

121
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
times of the Buddha and and there was a person the Buddha awakened being to go

122
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:31,360
to and to follow around and maybe to hand out but what does it mean for us 2,600

123
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,880
years later that was not not a Buddha to hang

124
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,840
out with and so uh what does this taking Refuge uh in

125
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:49,159
the Buddha mean so for some people uh the Buddha

126
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:55,039
represented a possibility to be free from suffering

127
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:01,320
duka and he's uh human being who realized the for Noble

128
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,760
Truth and um became an awakened human

129
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:14,200
being and that possibility itself and the fact that there is the GMA the

130
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:23,118
Buddha uh who did it may be inspiring and uplifting or aspiring for

131
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,560
people and that may be sufficient uh for people to

132
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:36,000
feel uh drawn towards this possibility and to feel the potency of

133
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,200
taking refuge in the Buddha and that's one possibility and it

134
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:48,919
kind of does a sense of oh I'm uplifted um by this possibility from this

135
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:54,480
historical figure the Buddha God the

136
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:02,359
Buddha um and but for others uh the sense of a

137
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:07,880
refuge uh for someone who lived uh in such a distant

138
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,000
time uh that Refuge can feel somewhat Elusive and

139
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,800
distant and given that we just don't know you know who this person is and uh

140
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,400
and how we relate to them are not completely

141
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:35,560
clear and so it's sometimes hard to translate the um inspiration or the

142
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:41,760
aspiration into something immediate uh or deeper inside of

143
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:50,280
us so how might the Refuge in the Buddha come alive in us and then touch us uh in

144
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,680
ways that feels meaningful and so there may be many ways

145
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,839
some of you may have uh exper experienced uh your own ways of relating

146
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:07,400
to this refuge and I like to share one aspect of

147
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:18,400
this uh one way to relate to this the word Buddha means awake or

148
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,440
awakeness the one who knows or knowing

149
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:31,000
and this is kind of knowing that's different from kind of reading a book and getting some kind of information but

150
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,839
rather this isn't knowing that is from deep within

151
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:44,640
ourselves and GMA the Buddha became awake through this kind of deep knowing

152
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,720
observing the nature of this body mind and

153
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:56,520
heart and so this Refuge uh in the Buddha points to the possibility of

154
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:03,359
being a awake and aware clear

155
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:12,599
seeing so in a way this Refuge is not asking us to try to become the Buddha

156
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:20,960
but rather we can cultivate this wakefulness clear awareness within

157
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:29,520
us in this way the cultivation itself is much more immediate uh um direct and the

158
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:38,839
possibility is here and now and it's not in some distant past or the

159
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:47,280
future I want to read this quote from um aan su's book uh intuitive

160
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:54,240
awareness and this is what he uh described about taking refuge in the

161
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:02,480
Buddha and so here it is we're asked to take refuge in our own ability to be

162
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:09,280
awake to pay attention to life no matter what the conditions might be in the

163
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:17,599
present moment the simple willingness to acknowledge things for what they are as

164
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:24,400
changing conditions liberates us from being caught in the power of

165
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:32,039
attachments in struggling with emotions or thoughts that we're

166
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:42,119
experiencing so might this be a kind of Refuge in the

167
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:48,280
Buddha take refuge in our own ability to be

168
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:55,200
awake to pay attention to life no matter what the conditions might be in the

169
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:02,480
present moment to me that really brought the Refuge in

170
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,680
Buddha close to my life you know it's here and now this moment in the midst of

171
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:18,200
the happenings the challenges the difficulties and the Comfort it's tangible and it's

172
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:25,520
practical and it's aligned with the teaching with the Dharma and so it's something that we can

173
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:32,880
turn to again and again whenever we remember and so right here I can choose

174
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,400
to be present aware to pay

175
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,640
attention you know as best as we're able we're not kind of demanding for it to be

176
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:50,359
somehow like a big light bulb with some high Watts or something but it's just oh

177
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:59,880
you know this moment what is here maybe if I'm frustrated or

178
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,040
fearful I can begin to tune into it and really get to know

179
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:13,200
it and so aan sumo's words this is simple willingness to acknowledge things

180
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:19,640
for what they are in our meditation I use this phrase

181
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,359
not demanding for things to be

182
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:32,359
otherwise there is a kindness and compassion right there while allowing

183
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:40,359
this aware aware awareness uh clear knowing to come forth little by

184
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:50,359
little so there a phrase that aato would often repeat again and again is the way

185
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:55,839
it is oh it is the way it is right

186
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:02,119
now and maybe maybe I'm a little agitated it is the way it

187
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:08,560
is when we know it clearly we can begin to feel and sense

188
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,800
it's a shift and change like you know in the uh

189
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,920
meditation I used this nature metaphor you know when we're really letting

190
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,800
ourselves soak in the mountain the various

191
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,920
ecosystems kind of softening into this we can begin to feel

192
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:39,839
and shift and the changes in the micro e uh micro system I was doing a hike this

193
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:45,880
last weekend I began to notice uh very

194
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,800
vividly as I was walking how the forest just changed the

195
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,040
terrain changes it was not a long hike but I can just began to notice oh wow

196
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:04,920
the trees have just changed um there was a whole uh kind of

197
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:13,839
Oak Oak Tree forest and as I walked more and more the oak tree began to change to

198
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:21,520
something different you I don't even know the names of the trees but they're no no longer Oaks and so we can begin to

199
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:28,000
feel and then uh uh uh feel the change of

200
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,359
the nature within instead of getting caught up in

201
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:40,079
our habitual um reactivities oh it shouldn't be like this I must have done

202
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,359
something wrong

203
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,359
and we get clear about the

204
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:58,079
patterns we began to notice this extra layers of reactivity

205
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:05,640
are compounding [Music] Dua they are added they're created

206
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:14,480
extra and so this is what Aang Sumo is pointing out when we begin to see this it's very

207
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,400
natural that we would release it because they make no sense you know to be

208
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,559
reactive like this and so it's possible to then in the

209
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:33,119
moment by seeing things clearly it liberates us

210
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,400
from being caught in the power of

211
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:47,280
attachment so we're learning to little by little uh live with lesser and lesser

212
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,760
degrees of this um compounding

213
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:01,440
dukka based on our judgments and uh our habitual

214
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:10,240
Tendencies and so in this way I'd like to uh summarize by pointing out that all

215
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:17,240
three refugees the triple Jam are not totally

216
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:23,960
separate they have a separate Dimensions or aspects but they

217
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:32,440
together form a kind of um structure for us to point to a kind

218
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:38,599
of cultivation within you know maybe we're uplifted by

219
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:48,000
the possibility of wakefulness like the Buddha and uh we are uh practicing along

220
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:56,000
um aligned with and the Buddha Dharma and were affected by the Sana so

221
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,520
that each of us can continue to deepen this possibility of

222
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:08,920
living in um a way that is wakeful aware

223
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:17,280
compassionate and caring and so that's the possibility and

224
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,680
um May this refuge in the Buddha Dharma and

225
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:31,480
S um offer a kind of orientation for each of us as we navigate our lives and

226
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:38,359
may it come alive in each of us so thank you for your attention

227
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:44,640
everyone and be well and may the goodness within be shared with all

228
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,400
beings everywhere
