1
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:33,060
all right okay is this on yeah our teacher will be a little late

2
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,759
this evening she got caught in traffic so

3
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:46,080
far isn't that like some kind of Grimm's Fairy Tale or something

4
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:54,199
oh I see okay here's Diana

5
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,539
thank you Jim and many of you know we'll do a 45

6
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:42,720
minute sit now so um Jim will ring the bell that uh 8 15 and then I'll give a

7
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,340
short talk thank you

8
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:22,039
good evening and welcome welcome everybody

9
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:30,240
so tonight I'd like to talk a little bit about meta this practice of loving

10
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:36,540
kindness some of you know that I'll be teaching a retreat on loving kindness and so this

11
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:44,359
is a little warm-up for me I kind of like a dig into the topic and

12
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,920
and so I'm sure many of you know that meta gets translated in a number of

13
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,079
different ways classically or maybe commonly I should

14
00:51:55,079 --> 00:52:01,140
say it's loving kindness but also we could use this idea of Goodwill

15
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:06,500
some people use friendliness some people use effort care Oh

16
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:12,319
warm-heartedness all kinds of different ways that we might understand

17
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:18,119
but uh but one thing that maybe distinguishes

18
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:26,099
meta from these other words like in in English this just love or good will

19
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:33,059
is that it has a quality or it's characterized by freedom

20
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:39,480
so it's this good will that has this quality of Freedom associated with it

21
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:44,640
there's a number of ways in which we might understand that you can't hear it so I think the volume needs to be a

22
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,359
little bit higher

23
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:55,079
there we go it's I don't know is this louder Maybe not maybe I'll just keep on

24
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:01,700
talking until the thing so there we go there we go that's you can hear now right yeah

25
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:10,680
so this Goodwill this uh sometimes this word love

26
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:16,859
sometimes that's not so easy or appropriate to use the word love because wow love sometimes has this a lot of

27
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:22,260
baggage associated with it but we might just

28
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:30,000
um also Define it as this heartfelt concern for the welfare of others for

29
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:38,400
the welfare of ourselves for the welfare of everybody so this heartfeltness this uh

30
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:45,440
yeah I like this word maybe concern for the welfare or care or something like this

31
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:52,500
and there's a way in which it's practiced probably many of you know this is a formal practice I'll talk just a

32
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:58,200
little bit about that but it's practiced in such a manner as to develop this care this

33
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:04,619
warm-heartedness meta so that it expands into maybe even

34
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:10,800
boundlessness or that it expands to unconditional

35
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,319
so this is what I mean by it's characterized by freedom is that it doesn't have limits

36
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:24,240
and it doesn't have conditions and I'll talk a little bit more about that but what does it mean to not have

37
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:29,400
limits or what does it mean to not have conditions

38
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:35,280
and so I appreciate very much that in this tradition there's this

39
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:41,940
teaching and this experience of we don't have to leave this feeling of warmth

40
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:49,079
this feeling of care to chance we don't have to wait until just all the right

41
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:54,720
conditions show up that the perfect person who deserves it has treated us

42
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:03,720
just the way we want or has done whatever we want and then we'll have this loving kindness no we can cultivate

43
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:10,380
this and develop it for everybody and of course that's a practice because

44
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:16,619
that's not the usual way that we move through the world or that we consider others or maybe even the way that we

45
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:23,160
consider ourselves so it's definitely something that can be cultivated

46
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:30,619
and there's a number of ways in which it can be cultivated a common way is to repeat phrases

47
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:38,460
may you be safe may you be happy may you be healthy may you live with

48
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:44,400
ease these are four common phrases and they're just repeated in the mind

49
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,559
silently to oneself and then that may you be happy so that

50
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:56,220
you who that you is kind of like changes as we move through categories of individuals

51
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:03,800
often starting with the easy being this could be kitten puppies babies

52
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:10,319
coach Mentor benefit or somebody who's really supported you and in which you

53
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:15,839
have an uncomplicated relationship so the absolute easiest

54
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:21,000
and then often oneself but then often a neutral person

55
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:28,800
somebody that we might see in a on occasion in the neighborhood and then a difficult person

56
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:33,900
and then to all beings so kind of like extend uh expanding more and more

57
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:41,099
individuals but there's a way in which that uh we

58
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:47,339
might think well how does this work and does it work does repeating these

59
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:54,119
phrases in a meditative state or even while doing things in our daily life or while

60
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:59,460
walking does it really have an impact

61
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:07,559
and there's this way in which it actually does and but there's some ways in which we can support this cultivation

62
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:12,839
this maybe expansion of this loving kindness this matter that all of us

63
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:20,460
already have we're not creating this de novo we're not creating this out of nothing we're

64
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:25,980
just maybe allowing it to grow allowing it to

65
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:31,980
expand to meet more and more people more and more conditions

66
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:38,940
and it turns out that one of the ways that can really support this cultivation

67
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:45,240
is to have a certain confidence that the practice works

68
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:51,480
because otherwise sometimes what can happen is we'll say may you be safe may

69
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:58,020
you be happy may you be healthy may you live with ease

70
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:03,180
I don't feel anything is this what you know what this doesn't

71
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:08,940
work what are they talking about I can't do this is does this work for anybody else

72
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:16,700
and so there's a way that we kind of like just stop doing this and the mind starts wandering or something

73
00:58:16,859 --> 00:58:23,579
but there's a way in which we might think about this uh practice like saying these phrases

74
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:28,980
is maybe twofold one is we can think about neuroplasticity we might use this

75
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:34,500
language you know it's kind of like modern language in fact what we incline

76
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:39,540
the Mind towards becomes the inclination of the mind if

77
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:45,780
it's not a secret it's not rocket science we've all have had this experience ourselves

78
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:52,020
but there's a way in which also we might think about it as planting seeds

79
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:58,500
and so saying these phrases is just planting a seed and in the same way that with Farmers

80
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:06,119
right they plant seeds but they can't see what's happening Underground in the same way we can't see what's

81
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:13,799
happening when we're saying these phrases when we are repeatedly coming back again and again to these phrases

82
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:19,920
so somebody once asked does this mean that we fake it until you

83
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:26,040
make it is that what we're supposed to be doing and uh kind of like hesitant to say that right because we don't want to

84
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:31,859
be like faking anything in this practice right kind of all this practice is you know we're just showing up for what's

85
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:38,819
happening but maybe we might say there's a little bit of fake it until you make it with

86
00:59:38,819 --> 00:59:44,880
loving kindness practice and I say that with a smile on my face because there's a little bit of Whimsy there

87
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:50,700
but this also we can say is just like having some confidence that even though

88
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:56,460
we're not like at that moment feeling anything in particular

89
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:04,319
might even be feeling bored I might be feeling aversive we might have been feeling the exact

90
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:11,220
opposite of loving kindness which is so often the case it's like may you be happy

91
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:18,839
and then I've had the case definitely when I've been doing loving kindness practice and oh my gosh I just oh these

92
01:00:18,839 --> 01:00:25,500
like really the worst things that you can imagine would come up in somebody's mind about

93
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:31,079
the person who was just sitting next to me they had nothing against this person sitting next to me I just happened to be

94
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:37,140
on a retreat and this is just what kind of came up and Spilled Out this poor person

95
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:42,720
you know I don't even know who it was so there's a way in which we're doing

96
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:51,359
loving kindness practice and all of the opposite of loving kindness comes up the hatred that it will the aversion

97
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:56,460
but if there's a way in which we can just have confidence like okay this

98
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:02,220
happens too this is part of the practice and as best we can just to be coming

99
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:08,760
back to the phrases coming back to Our intention

100
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:15,180
so we're not trying to manufacture or cook up or engineer or trick ourselves

101
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:20,460
into feeling anything or having any particular experience

102
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:26,940
it's more that we're just like creating the conditions and which makes it more likely that

103
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:32,339
those that experience of loving kindness will arise and if it doesn't it's

104
01:01:32,339 --> 01:01:39,960
perfectly okay we're just practicing plants the seeds may be germinating but

105
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:48,540
you know we don't see it yet so I like this expression that Roberta

106
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:55,260
has said about loving kindness is sometimes when we hear these teachings we might have this idea

107
01:01:55,260 --> 01:02:00,359
like you know there's supposed to be this unconditionality or this boundlessness and there might be this

108
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:07,799
feeling like really do humans really do that is that even possible like it's just

109
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:13,380
instead it sounds like some rarified or maybe something that's been

110
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:21,540
passed down through the ages that doesn't actually happen feels unrealistic or a bit too much maybe too

111
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:28,200
contrived or something like this so um Robert Bay uses this expression

112
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:34,099
we don't have to think that we have to be the squeaky clean meta machine

113
01:02:34,099 --> 01:02:40,799
so it's an idea that we're just cranking out like meta non-stop like a robot or

114
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:46,200
something practice isn't like that when we hear the instructions we might

115
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:51,359
think oh this is what we're supposed to do just say these phrases and then out

116
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:59,160
comes some loving kindness but there's a way in which it can sound

117
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:06,000
like dry or not only something that's just like supposed to maybe magically happen

118
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,940
but not only that it can feel like the rubber band points to this this the

119
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:17,579
way the reason why he used the word machine is it can feel like well

120
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:23,160
I'm saying these phrases there's a way that it doesn't have any of our own

121
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:30,780
self-expression or doesn't have any of our personality or doesn't have any of

122
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:36,059
how we practice showing up and so in some ways there might be some

123
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:41,280
hesitation to do it because it doesn't feel maybe authentic or it doesn't feel

124
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:48,000
it feels maybe stifling but it's important to know that there's

125
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,640
a way in which a we can modify the phrases there's nothing magic about

126
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:59,160
those particular phrases that I just shared but you're welcome and encouraged to

127
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:04,220
modify them with a certain parameters the parameters are keeping them simple

128
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:11,099
and not too specific for example not like may you get that job that you want

129
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:17,400
on Tuesday at 9 00 a.m you know right it's more like may you be happy so

130
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:25,020
something that more General like this but there's a way in which this uh the

131
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:30,660
loving kindness the manifestation the expression the arising

132
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:38,400
it's really unique for all of us because it's not just one thing

133
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:44,280
this meta isn't just a do I have it do I not have it

134
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:50,339
it's more like how does it getting expressed or how does it feel sometimes

135
01:04:50,339 --> 01:04:56,760
it feels really like a physical thing some warm-heartedness in the chest

136
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:02,760
sometimes it feels bubbly and bright and maybe like joyful

137
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:08,119
sometimes it feels really calm and smooth

138
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:14,700
maybe sometimes it feels like it has this quality of healing to

139
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:23,700
it or loving kindness meta might just have like this quality of gentleness and care

140
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:29,280
so there's all these different ways these different aspects that can show up in these different ways that can be

141
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:35,640
experienced it's certainly how it shows up is different for everybody it's certainly

142
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:41,040
different during different times of practice maybe at the beginning of a meditation session

143
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:48,480
there's absolutely nothing and then maybe it shows up one way and then morphs into another way

144
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:55,380
but I just wanted to recognize that sometimes it can feel uh maybe even oppressive like I would say these

145
01:05:55,380 --> 01:06:02,760
sayings these phrases over and over again but it's it's enormously powerful it's

146
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:10,339
gonna be really powerful and so I've been talking about the

147
01:06:10,339 --> 01:06:15,839
conditionality unconditionality of meta

148
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:21,660
so then there's a way in which we might be practicing and we might be noticing that

149
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:28,440
well maybe we do have some conditions for the people in our family that we

150
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:34,200
care about or you know that we love but sometimes they're irritating sometimes

151
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:39,299
they we have like well you know when you do

152
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:44,579
that thing makes me feel less warm-hearted towards

153
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:51,660
you something like this this we're all humans right this is part of the human experience we all have relationships of

154
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:58,619
a number of different relationships or maybe it's the opposite maybe we feel

155
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:04,260
like there's people in our family that we feel this real attachment to

156
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:11,520
so it's not this kind of robber base expression squeaky clean there's this feeling like

157
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:18,319
of course like we feel so attached to our partners our children our family

158
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:25,680
and so when we might be practicing love and kindness and we might feel some of this oh I do have some of this

159
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:31,140
attachment oh I do have some of this conditionality for example if we're

160
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:37,559
using a friend or a family member as a the person we're doing loving kindness

161
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:45,480
and sometimes there might be this temptation like I'm not doing it right or everybody else is doing it or this

162
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:51,900
one maybe I should use a different category maybe I shouldn't use this person or something like that

163
01:07:51,900 --> 01:08:00,839
but there's also an encouragement to just notice oh yeah this is what a

164
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:07,020
touchman feels like oh yeah this is what conditionality feels like

165
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:12,299
and to just be with that and just to recognize that's part of loving kindness

166
01:08:12,299 --> 01:08:17,420
practice as well right is this movement

167
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:23,219
unconditionality this movement of boundlessness of course we need to learn

168
01:08:23,219 --> 01:08:30,480
and be familiar with what are the conditions what are the feelings that are limiting what are the attachments

169
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:35,940
of course we do so just part of the practice is to

170
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:43,020
experience them and then there's a way in which we just can fold that into the practice too and maybe have some of this

171
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:50,520
loving kindness this warmth this care go towards this attachment go towards this conditionality that

172
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:55,980
we're having it's rather than trying to be dismissive like I can't do loving kindness for this

173
01:08:55,980 --> 01:09:02,640
person or at this time just like oh okay there's that attachment I don't have to get rid of

174
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:08,539
this attachment I just need to notice it

175
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:15,420
be with it see it the same with the conditionality that we might notice

176
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:21,080
because there's this way in that with love and kindness practice we want to

177
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:28,560
include our Humanity we want to include our complexity we want to include all

178
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:36,838
the different aspects of ourselves and our lives which means it's not you know squeaky

179
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:43,738
clean nice neat and tidy all of our relationships have different aspects and

180
01:09:43,739 --> 01:09:50,338
elements to them of course they do of course they do

181
01:09:50,339 --> 01:09:57,000
and so there's this way in which loving kindness practice for some people just feels like I don't want to do that

182
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:03,239
and maybe they just don't even know why they don't like it but part of the reason might be because they have this

183
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:09,840
idea that it should be you know super clean ideal

184
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:16,140
and it's easy to see that I know I certainly did I heard about loving kindness practice first time I really

185
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:22,980
heard about it was on a retreat and it was really off-putting for me because it just all sudden put up all the ways

186
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:28,140
in which I wasn't being kind and to others and to myself and it made me just

187
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:35,280
feel bad so I didn't want to do it but there's this way in which we can

188
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:44,040
I don't know hold the complexity the messiness the reality of Our Lives

189
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:50,640
and for me that feels more fun and kind of a relief to like okay to put down

190
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:56,100
this idea that loving kindness has to be in one particular way and to recognize

191
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:03,420
that instead there's this learning process that happens with love and kindness practice

192
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:10,219
and part of the learning is conditionality and limits

193
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:18,678
so loving kindness practice it certainly has a role in Buddhist practice

194
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:25,679
there's a number of different roles in which it has in which we might work with

195
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:31,860
loving-kindness practice and maybe I'll just say is a really broad brush really

196
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:39,300
broad stroke I would say in Buddhist practice we can make a gross generalization and say

197
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:44,640
there are some cultivation practices and there's some Letting Go practices

198
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:49,800
you know that's a false dichotomy because often letting go is cultivating

199
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:56,040
and cultivating is letting go but just for the purposes of this I'll say that so

200
01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:02,880
loving kindness it's part of cultivation practice the same way that mindfulness concentration

201
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:07,920
ethics maybe we could even say some wisdom there's a way in which those are

202
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:14,159
cultivated So Meta loving kindness friendliness

203
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:21,960
Goodwill is definitely part of one of those practices but interestingly

204
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:28,579
loving kindness meta is also related to effort

205
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:35,699
some of you will recognize that right effort is the sixth step in the April path

206
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:42,300
but when there's too much effort when there's this striving and this

207
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:48,780
tightening and like this really I gotta get this there's something that's gonna happen

208
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:56,460
and whatever practice we're doing most often implicit in that is

209
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:01,620
there's a me here who wants to get something over there

210
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:09,780
and that over there might be like later in time so there's this real sense of lack

211
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:16,080
a real strong sense of me a real strong sense that things aren't quite right or the way that they

212
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:22,760
shouldn't be and instead something else should be happening

213
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:30,659
whereas loving kindness practice is more about a sense of abundance

214
01:13:30,659 --> 01:13:37,860
rather than like and it's really more of a softening of the sense of me having to

215
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:45,380
get something there's even less of a sense of me and a less of a sense of I have to get something

216
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:53,760
so they're in some ways like loving kindness practices is a way to it can be an antidotal way to work with the sense

217
01:13:53,760 --> 01:14:01,020
of striving and straining which turns out not to work so well and

218
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:08,719
meditation practice it works in our professional lives it works for Education it might even work with

219
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:15,480
gardening in some of our Hobbies right so working and striving certainly Works

220
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:23,219
in certain situations and it'll work a little bit in meditation until it doesn't it can only get you so

221
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:29,880
far this is where the cultivation and letting go has to go so letting go of striving and straining is definitely a

222
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:37,020
part of practice so loving kindness practice is a way that can support the right amount of

223
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:44,280
effort because the right amount of effort this is such a delicate

224
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:53,159
thing in all of our practice then we might even say it's part of the art of practice is know when to lean in

225
01:14:53,159 --> 01:15:00,000
and apply a little bit more diligence the more effort and when to back off

226
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:07,140
this is something only with experience we kind of learn but with loving kindness practice maybe

227
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:12,719
increases the sensitivity because 11 codes practice is an opening

228
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:17,880
and when there's a straining that's a closing so we could feel we're a little bit more

229
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:24,060
sensitive to this straining and maybe because it's 11 kind of

230
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:31,440
practices of opening and yet there's still a practice helps us to not have two lacks of effort

231
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:38,699
because we're keeping on coming back to the phrases so it's not like we're opening and then going to sleep or

232
01:15:38,699 --> 01:15:43,800
something like so loving kindness is also can be a

233
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:50,100
support for the amount of effort there's also a way in which we can say

234
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:55,140
as I alluded to earlier like saying these phrases we can feel like

235
01:15:55,140 --> 01:16:00,239
I don't want to say these phrases it's one thing to say it in meditation but I

236
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:06,540
don't want to say it you know off the cushion I I have important thoughts to think

237
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:13,860
I have I would need to be creative I want to be self-express myself and I

238
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:20,239
don't want to while I'm doing the dishes or walking or whatever it is I'll do these phrases

239
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:28,140
well if you have a meditation practice and if you've ever done some meditation in Daily practice and you looked at your

240
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:35,880
mind maybe you'll notice how often do we get like stuck right and

241
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:42,420
we're just kind of thinking the same thing over and over and over there's a way in which we get a little bit

242
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:47,460
entangled with something and there isn't anything new thoughts happening

243
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:52,980
it's not too creative it's not really moving things forward and it's not necessarily supporting our

244
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:59,580
life or how many times just even some of the we're trying to remember the grocery

245
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:05,760
list I know sometimes I'm doing this like okay Diana remember to get the ABCD

246
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:10,520
you know sometimes I do remember sometimes I don't

247
01:17:11,699 --> 01:17:18,840
but there says many of the thoughts that we have aren't as helpful as we might think that

248
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:25,739
they are often we're berating ourselves criticizing ourselves with this like

249
01:17:25,739 --> 01:17:32,100
under the radar this chatter that's maybe accompanying us

250
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:39,780
or maybe there's this way in which we're thinking unkind thoughts about other people or thinking unkind thoughts about

251
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:47,040
the situation I can't believe they let this happen it shouldn't be like this and who's in charge here or you know

252
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:53,580
we're trying to blame others or something like this so it turns out to have a living

253
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:59,820
kindness practice to be saying these phrases and just regular life

254
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:05,280
is a way in which it might be replacing some unskillful thoughts some unhelpful

255
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:10,640
thoughts it's an unhelpful thought patterns

256
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:17,699
and not only might it be replacing things that are unhelpful it's creating

257
01:18:17,699 --> 01:18:23,940
the conditions in which there can be this sense of ease and connectedness

258
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:31,380
and warmth and care and our lives unfold so differently if

259
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:37,440
we have that sense of ease and care and connectedness this is what so many of us want

260
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:45,659
in our lives to feel like there's this some peace on some uplift and a sense of

261
01:18:45,659 --> 01:18:50,820
well-being so there's a way in which it might make

262
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:58,020
a lot of sense actually to doing some loving kindness practice not only as an official practice

263
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:03,659
while we're on the cushion but also in our daily life to be repeating phrases

264
01:19:03,659 --> 01:19:10,940
or while we're doing walking meditation so certainly we have a

265
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:16,860
mindfulness or Insight practices also be choosing loving kindness

266
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:21,900
practices and I know some people that have uh you know said okay for these

267
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:27,139
months all my practice is just going to be loving kindness

268
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:35,040
turns out to be really transformative it turns out to really

269
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:42,440
do some of this rewiring this neuroplasticity turns out to be a real thing

270
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:49,739
and it softens and loosens up some of the things in our hearts and Minds

271
01:19:49,739 --> 01:20:00,300
to have a regular loving kindness practice but then maybe I'll end on this topic

272
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:06,140
sometimes when we talk about loving kindness when we're talking about meta

273
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:12,420
we're often thinking like you know for other people and often than the examples that I've been giving this evening have

274
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:20,719
been about that turns out it's so important to have loving kindness for oneself

275
01:20:21,239 --> 01:20:26,820
and for many people this turns out to be not so easy

276
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:33,060
it's difficult there's many reasons why it might be difficult to really appreciate ourselves

277
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:38,219
and send love and care and warmth to ourselves

278
01:20:38,219 --> 01:20:45,360
it could be you know messaging that regards from our family or from school or something like this

279
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:50,580
friends but I also want to just highlight that

280
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:56,820
there's cultural reasons too that there's a way in which uh it's kind

281
01:20:56,820 --> 01:21:02,280
of like there's mixed messages it might seem that we certainly hear in the

282
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:10,380
United States we have this culture of individuality like we take pride of you know like I can do it I can

283
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:16,620
pull myself up in the bootstraps like we have this kind of expression it's not true in the way that we think

284
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:21,719
it is but that is kind of something like you know these Cowboys had to go out and

285
01:21:21,719 --> 01:21:28,320
make do something we have this sense of you know I can do it

286
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:33,719
or or there's also we see more and more this idea of me first

287
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:39,060
but go take care of me and make as much money as possible or you know whatever

288
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:44,340
and okay yeah okay you guys are okay all right but really me first right we see a

289
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:52,440
lot of that so you might think like oh that promotes this sense of love for oneself but

290
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:58,080
it turns out there's also this message of

291
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:06,000
it's selfish to take care of yourself to do things for yourself

292
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:11,340
there's a way in which it's indulgent or

293
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:18,239
inappropriate to take time for yourself and that's why there's often there's talk about self-care we have to like

294
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:23,940
remind people you have to take care of yourself you can't just always be giving to

295
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:30,360
others so there's like both of these messages are just out there in the culture all mixed up and

296
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:37,820
we have received a number of different ideas in our minds

297
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:45,600
but it turns out that you know loving kindness for oneself this needs often is a real practice and

298
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:53,340
to work with this inner critic that's always telling us that we're inadequate insufficient more has to happen

299
01:22:53,340 --> 01:23:01,980
you can't rest until a b and c and d have been acquired attained and then

300
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:07,980
have you ever noticed as soon as you get a oh yeah but then there's e also and then as soon as you get you know one oh

301
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:12,920
yeah there's this right it's never ending never ending

302
01:23:15,179 --> 01:23:23,159
so meta for oneself it turns out to be a big topic

303
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:29,060
it's inner critic often makes it not so easy

304
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:37,620
maybe here I'll just say briefly that uh there's a it's helpful to just

305
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:45,659
start where it's easy absolute easiest babies kittens puppies whatever it might

306
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:50,820
be and then here's the tricky part

307
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:56,699
day with that category stay with just with kittens and puppies

308
01:23:56,699 --> 01:24:01,920
people want to do kittens and puppies and babies and they feel good like oh

309
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:07,440
okay now I feel a little bit of meant to okay now I'm gonna use this meant to use

310
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:14,699
it all the problems in my life I'm going to use this as a tool or I'm going to shoot out to meta to everybody else and

311
01:24:14,699 --> 01:24:21,060
that works a little bit but what really works better is to stay

312
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:26,280
with wherever it's easy kittens puppies babies or who whatever benefactor coach

313
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:35,100
Mentor teacher whomever is to allow the loving kindness to start

314
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:40,920
to Bubble Up and just stay with there stay with this category

315
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:46,920
and then what happens is it just starts to Bubble Up and then it just starts to

316
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:52,800
leak out you can't help it it just starts to leak out and it starts

317
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:58,080
to leak out and they say about yourself and other people without you having to

318
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:04,380
direct it so there's a way in which we often like we experience it but there

319
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:10,920
might be a way in which we need to fill up the tank so to speak

320
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:16,440
that might be a way in which we need to really roll around in it in some way and

321
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:24,420
there's a way in which often people have this kind of like this starvation of this sense of love and warmth and Care

322
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:30,239
inside and well-being and so allowing oneself to really drink

323
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:35,340
it up for as long as it takes as long as it takes

324
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:40,920
a day a week a month a year makes absolutely no difference how long and

325
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:46,620
then it just naturally flows out it just naturally flows out to ourselves

326
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:52,080
and to others often loving kindness when it's taught

327
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:58,380
it's not taught that way but Todd would do this category and then just for pedagogical reasons go to the next

328
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:03,420
category of individual then for pedagogical reasons whether you're ready or not the teacher goes to the next

329
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:09,780
category so the part of the discipline is to like maybe hear oh the teachers doing that

330
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:17,699
but I'm not ready I I want to stay here no timeline absolutely no timeline

331
01:26:17,699 --> 01:26:24,060
for this to happen for this to work it's a living kindness meta

332
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:31,260
Goodwill friendliness warm-heartedness towards ourselves and towards others

333
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:36,360
really powerful practice I could talk more about it some ways in

334
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:44,060
which it supports Buddhist practice as well as well as ways it supports our lives but I won't at this time

335
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:50,719
instead I'll open it up and see if there's some questions or comments

336
01:26:55,620 --> 01:27:00,739
does anybody have anything they'd like to say or ask

337
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:16,739
well I'll say something thank you for your talk

338
01:27:16,739 --> 01:27:23,239
um I've made meta the practice that I do before I got out of bed in the morning

339
01:27:23,239 --> 01:27:29,639
you know just as a way to prepare myself for meeting things and

340
01:27:29,639 --> 01:27:37,620
the a couple things came up when you were talking one was like starting with the easy category

341
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:44,159
and then sort of sending out feelers to see can I like I wonder if I think you

342
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:49,500
know like what if I offer to this person what's that like this morning right now

343
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:55,739
and you know sometimes it's like yeah that's possible and then uh and

344
01:27:55,739 --> 01:28:03,540
sometimes being surprised you know like oh yeah you know I didn't and uh the other image that came to me

345
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:09,900
was something Gil talked about um kind of like doing yoga there's there's

346
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:17,100
a way of doing this I don't know it's a sun salute or something if you put a phone book there used to be

347
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:22,139
these books called phone books and you could reach down and you could

348
01:28:22,139 --> 01:28:27,239
touch the phone book and then each day tearing out one page

349
01:28:27,239 --> 01:28:33,420
you know and like it takes you know I don't know a year or something to get one more inch but you

350
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:40,739
know it's sort of like just that very nice tearing out one page of the phone book each day very nice I love that

351
01:28:40,739 --> 01:28:46,920
that's a great that's great thank you I was talking about like seeds germinating but carried out a book I love it thank

352
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:54,198
you yeah thank you anybody else have a comment

353
01:28:57,780 --> 01:29:03,239
thank you for the talk um so and the way you explained it like

354
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:08,460
I am also like I find it very hard to be appreciative of myself I have this

355
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:15,659
tendency of criticizing myself a lot and when I try loving kindness it just

356
01:29:15,659 --> 01:29:21,120
doesn't seem to work especially like you know in times of stress it can sometimes

357
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:27,840
be very difficult to stick to a practice uh which takes very long which takes a

358
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:34,199
very long time as in like you know if it has to spell to myself then if I have to stick to the practice for a very long

359
01:29:34,199 --> 01:29:41,400
time especially in terms times of stress it can be like really difficult so how do I

360
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:46,440
kind of make myself stick to it when it's like not paying dividends on a

361
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:52,139
short time frame in in some way is it just like you have to believe in it and

362
01:29:52,139 --> 01:29:57,480
stick with it or are there some other tricks which work for people in general

363
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,380
yeah yeah

364
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:09,719
yeah way in which uh loving kindness when it's uh use it for the easy B the B

365
01:30:09,719 --> 01:30:16,100
the person that's the or person doesn't have to be a person getting puppies babies Etc we choose whatever is easy

366
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:21,239
because hopefully we might imagine that there can be some

367
01:30:21,239 --> 01:30:28,320
warmth or some something that happens no guarantees right but usually there is

368
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:33,480
something that's a little bit pleasurable about it maybe we can feel a

369
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:38,880
little bit uh relaxing of the body when we think of

370
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:46,080
I'm just going to make this up a baby like a new baby in the family that just makes us really just so happy to think

371
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:51,659
about this baby so cute and and so to tune so we're doing love and kindness

372
01:30:51,659 --> 01:30:57,300
practice but also to tune into like what's happening in the body it's

373
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:03,540
usually a pleasant experience to be like oh it's so cute and I wish the best for

374
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:11,100
this baby like they have this whole life in front of them and they're so adorable and so there's this uh can be this

375
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:18,600
relaxation experience it might be subtle but what happens is it grows

376
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:24,600
and so that pleasurable experience grows and grows and grows and can Encompass

377
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:30,120
the whole body so it's when you're saying it will take a long time it

378
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:37,380
won't be like something that you have to force yourself to do it might be you have to use some

379
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:44,340
you might have to use some effort to initially start the practice but with you stay with the easy being it

380
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:50,760
usually ends up being a pleasant experience say that and then maybe something else I'll just

381
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:57,540
say as an aside that um for a number of years I taught what we call like a happy hour or it's something

382
01:31:57,540 --> 01:32:03,060
that's on on Audio Dharma and I did a series where I did the inner

383
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:10,980
critic and loving kindness like a series of I don't know maybe 20 short Little Talks

384
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:17,219
short being like 10 minutes five to ten minute little talks on this so if you're if this is something you want to look

385
01:32:17,219 --> 01:32:23,820
into you get to look on Audio Dharma and there's a whole uh little series on this of a number of little things to do and

386
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:30,120
that includes guided meditations also so sometimes that could be helpful if we feel like I can't do this I don't want

387
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:35,900
to do this sometimes listening to a guided meditation can be a support

388
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:42,500
thank you yeah you're welcome yes sir one more comment here

389
01:32:43,139 --> 01:32:51,780
foreign thank you for the talk um so one question is why do we

390
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:57,780
categorize as all this like myself others like friend and instead of saying

391
01:32:57,780 --> 01:33:03,719
just all beings be happy uh if doing just that versus doing this

392
01:33:03,719 --> 01:33:10,380
separate things um I'm trying to understand what's the difference

393
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:16,440
um yeah I think there's another question but yeah so the question is why categories instead of just all beings

394
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:23,280
yeah yeah yeah because uh all beings is more of a concept that's an idea that we

395
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:28,739
don't know well beings of course we don't so it's much easier actually it turns out

396
01:33:28,739 --> 01:33:34,020
it's much easier to have like loving kindness for all beings because it's

397
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:39,360
we're not in contact necessarily with the people that get under our skin or

398
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:44,719
the people that we don't know so the practice is to be with actual

399
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:50,040
individuals in the beginning that we know because like even with our friends

400
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:56,280
or our family that we're doing right it's there's sometimes a little bit of difficulties in those relationships but

401
01:33:56,280 --> 01:34:02,040
to still have loving kindness anyway and that's where the practice is

402
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:09,719
and so and then one of the individual one of the categories is neutral people so people we don't know but the

403
01:34:09,719 --> 01:34:14,940
instructions are as best you can to find a neutral a single neutral person

404
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:20,639
something that you see in the neighborhood or maybe somebody that you see at the grocery store or something

405
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:25,800
like this so can you send Goodwills to an individual that you don't know and

406
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:32,480
that turns out to not be so easy so that's a real cultivation practice

407
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:38,699
second question is on how do we actually practice this you mentioned uh the the

408
01:34:38,699 --> 01:34:45,380
people who do this for the whole month instead of breath meditation or other ones

409
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:51,600
and also like I think during the day repeating this so on a

410
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:56,760
practical instruction level or like how do we actually do this like

411
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:02,300
yeah when you remember you just bring to mind

412
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:07,980
may you be happy may you be healthy safe the veggies

413
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:14,219
um and you could start with the lovable you could start through categories or if

414
01:35:14,219 --> 01:35:21,179
you're in your daily life and you could just when you see somebody on the sidewalk you see somebody at work you could just do it for that individual

415
01:35:21,179 --> 01:35:27,420
or you could do it for yourself so there's lots you can play around with it in your daily life it's just when you

416
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:33,840
remember so you kind of like set the intention when I remember I'm gonna do these phrases and then of course you won't

417
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:41,000
remember and nor is it appropriate like when you're working or reading you're not going to be doing that as not necessarily but

418
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:46,739
sitting practice um instead of the breath meditation do this or

419
01:35:46,739 --> 01:35:52,520
yeah okay and there's if you're interested there are

420
01:35:52,520 --> 01:36:00,120
hundreds let's think about this we did this five days a week for three years yeah so there are hundreds of guided

421
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:05,159

422
01:36:05,159 --> 01:36:11,639
