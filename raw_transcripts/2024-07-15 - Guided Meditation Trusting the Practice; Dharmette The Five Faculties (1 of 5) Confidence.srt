um let me change my name here so you can see

10
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,040
who's sitting in for Gill this week

11
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,960
there good morning everyone good day

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:35,880
welcome so we'll begin as as we begin with a sit and uh let me set up the sit

13
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,439
by tell you what what I intend to share this

14
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,240
week I'll share this week a teaching referred to as the five faculties

15
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,920
sometimes the five spiritual faculties and this week I'm going to

16
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,200
going to think of them as I share this this teaching as the five Divine

17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,039
faculties another way to think of them and a particular spin I enjoy is to

18
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:15,000
think of them as five human Divine faculties these are aspects of

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,280
our of our sort of inherited um capacity to be present and

20
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:32,800
to be free and there's no chance that in these various years teaching uh this five

21
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:40,400
weekday program that Gil has not also shared these teachings and uh you'll recognize you'll

22
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,920
hear Echoes of Gil's teachings but one of the wonderful things about uh sitting in for Gil is the

23
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,200
opportunity to share Gil's teachings for each of us Ying last week myself this

24
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,519
week others of Gill students in the coming weeks refracted through the

25
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,560
prison of our own practice and our own experience in life and uh so these will

26
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:12,319
be familiar teachings but they'll have a particular flavor I'm going to make a a point of

27
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,400
sharing some of the ways that gills uh approach to these five

28
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,920
faculties has shifted over time that's sort of my teaser that toward the end of

29
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:30,040
our toward the end of a brief daret after we finish sitting I'll share some of what I take to be ways that Gil has

30
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,200
come to appreciate these teachings in the new light in the last few

31
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,599
years so the five faculties the five spiritual faculties the five human

32
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:48,720
Divine faculties beginning today with with the confidence that grows as

33
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,760
our practice deepens and it's in it's in specific aspects of the practice that we

34
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,920
can attune ourselves to the confidence that the practice provides us in life

35
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,560
and our confidence in in being in the practice I'll say more about that after

36
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,079
we sit after we sit and after we dedicate the Merit of our of our practice

37
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,880
together I'll guide only briefly and only lightly but find

38
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,800
yourself into your your meditation posture whatever that is and no matter

39
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,320
what posture of the various postures that we can adopt for the meditation

40
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,840
we seek to find balance in the posture any posture and all postures

41
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,280
that enable us to be here fully present alert and awake and at the very same

42
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,199
time relaxed receptive any posture that allows us to

43
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:56,759
balance our attention between effort and

44
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:03,320
allowing is a legitimate posture and as we perhaps bring our eyes down

45
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,800
Close Our Eyes fully if that is feels safe and comfortable for us we

46
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,680
can we can notice a natural rebalancing that happens in each of the five faculties we'll explore this week I'll

47
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,520
emphasize that these are capacities within we're not reaching outside ourselves to acquire something that we

48
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,440
don't already have what we're doing is paying attention to to capaity within

49
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:37,840
and as we pay attention to them we cultivate them as we bring our attention to them they're

50
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:47,240
strengthened and we can do this as we first sit with just noticing balance taking place our eyes turn

51
00:05:52,759 --> 00:06:00,199
inward and our uh attention comes from the visual external Realm

52
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,479
to the uh to the inner

53
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:15,759
life at the same time we can feel the attention moving

54
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:23,840
Inward and downward sort of from the head to the heart from the head to the heart to the body

55
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:38,199
and we can by bringing our attention to the breathing we

56
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:43,479
can notice the natural equilibrium that

57
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:51,000
the breath establishes for us right in the center of our being the breath is

58
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,039
balanced I like that the breath is so confident in what it does knows the right Cor quantity of

59
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:05,960
oxygen needed the right quantity of carbon dioxide and other waste gases to

60
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,479
expel the breath doesn't concern itself with the future or the past the breath

61
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,000
just sits here and by connecting our attention with the breath we take on some of these

62
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,280
qualities whenever we return our attention to the breathing we reconnect with the Natural Balance in our

63
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,120
experience and again as we connect with it it strengthens

64
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,160
when we return attention to the breathing after the mind gets caught up and things snagged by thought planning

65
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,199
for looking forward to the day review if maybe the day is already

66
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,560
passed thinking about other people thinking about ourselves the natural field of the

67
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,800
mind whenever we bring it back to the breathing nothing's gone wrong we didn't

68
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,479
do anything wrong in fact each time we come back to

69
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,800
the breath There's an opportunity to strengthen the capacity to be

70
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,120
here so we can celebrate each time we come back instead of perhaps judging

71
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,000
that we shouldn't have or we're no good at this or it doesn't work just kind of let go of those kinds of thoughts and

72
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,440
just feel feel quite happy and content to be able to keep coming back here

73
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

74
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360

e

108
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
e e

109
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,559
so as we come toward the end of

110
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:25,440
this period of meditation maybe once again we can touch

111
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,320
in with that sense of rebalancing that happens when we direct our attention

112
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:38,159
back to the center of things back to the here and the now of our

113
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:45,840
experience we can do this by touching back in with the breathing the sensations of the just

114
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:53,600
this in breath here just this out breath here

115
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,799
we can be sure that this coming back to Center

116
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:19,279
is good and we can reinforce this habit of mind this

117
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:27,080
ability to come back to complete presence simply by noticing what it

118
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:33,840
feels like when we come back back to the center this is a

119
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:40,679
pleasure of coming back home or coming back here from wherever the mind's gotten

120
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:49,159
wandered off to or caught up in this particular pleasure of return in

121
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:54,240
the meditation returning to equilibrium returning to Center returning to ground

122
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,639
returning to home the teachings encourage en US to

123
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:07,440
enjoy it's an important signal to the brain and the being that there's a

124
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,440
wholesome pleasure here in the

125
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,360
meditation so we can feel confident that this is a good

126
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:27,080
place to come back to sometimes it's good and enhances the

127
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:33,880
sense of return to bring a couple phrases to

128
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:46,200
mind whatever's coming up in the practice for you that's what's supposed to be coming

129
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:52,080
up we can trust the practice to lead

130
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,240
us toward wholesome mind States and skillful action

131
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:06,440
there's nothing that's coming up that needs to be excluded or

132
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:17,519
rejected and you don't need anything more than what's right here right

133
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,480
now we don't need to reach

134
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,679
outside we have sufficient right here inside our

135
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:49,600
experience sometimes it's useful to use the phrase I belong here

136
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:13,240
and we can share this sense of confidence with others simply by returning

137
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:24,440
here Gil sometimes says points out that the world that we live in the world

138
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:33,120
around us really needs people who can be confident in their direct

139
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,559
experience who can be settled who can cultivate a peace of

140
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:44,880
mind that can hold strong

141
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,440
during moments of turbulence

142
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,919
so we can share the confidence we feel in the

143
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,360
practice with other beings everywhere wishing all

144
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,399
beings well wishing all beings Safety and

145
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:22,720
Security wholeness and body comfort and contentedness and

146
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,840
mind may all beings know

147
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:37,240
something of this sense of balance and home that we can experience in the

148
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,200
meditation may all beings be benefited by this

149
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,960
practice and may all beings be free

150
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:08,570
[Music]

151
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,639
so while welcome again everyone The View I have of you is the

152
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:40,559
lovely greetings you share with one another in the chat I appreciate everybody being here and I see bowing

153
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:47,639
Emoji so I return a bow yeah so I want to talk about the

154
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:55,000
five faculties this week the five spiritual faculties as they're frequently known Poncha Andrea in in

155
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,240
ply and uh I had the wonderful experience of teaching the five

156
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,919
faculties last week down at the retreat center in Santa Cruz the Insight retreat

157
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,800
center with my wonderful colleague Andrea Castillo we talked together in Spanish for a

158
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,118
week and uh the notes I have to share about these teachings are in Spanish I'm

159
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,240
going to sort of um just let them come into English as

160
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:28,480
they as they do but um

161
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:35,800
yeah when you take these teachings and you bring them into practice each time they they have a

162
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:42,599
lovely way of um expanding to meet the circumstances of a particular particular

163
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:49,118
place in one's practice and uh what I think will come forward this week as we

164
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,800
talk a little bit about each of these five faculties is the way in which their

165
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:02,640
their innate Capac aties within each of us and possibly in all beings and that we

166
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,160
cultivate them by bringing attention to them this I find really reassuring and

167
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:16,040
uh quite a gift of practice that we don't have to look outside we don't have to go anywhere we don't have to be any

168
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:22,000
different uh the capacities we have to be fully awake are are right here and

169
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,560
always available we may not see them clearly we may not um be as aware of

170
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,359
them as we can in practice and that's what we that's what we do when we explore them as teachings and bring them

171
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:40,040
into the meditation the first of these faculties

172
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:47,400
is Sada uh which I like to translate following following Gil as

173
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,680
confidence also like the word trust and what I wanted to bring

174
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:58,920
attention to in the guided meditation today and I was a little thrown by some of the challenges I was having with the

175
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:07,280
IMC YouTube account I think we wrestled and um and uh sharing the Dharma

176
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,119
one um today the um but the in the

177
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:22,200
guided part of what I hope to point to is that it's in our direct experience of

178
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:29,440
of of the breath of the of the being here now that we can have

179
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,560
confidence uh you know there there's a lot where it's U as soon as the mind

180
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,800
starts adding judgment for example around having the Mind get caught up in

181
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:48,359
something else as soon as the mind gets caught up and adding extra to our experience preference or wants wanting

182
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:54,280
something different or trying to push something away or exclude something from experience this shouldn't be here this

183
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:00,640
shouldn't be happening as soon as that starts to happen we sort of lose contact with direct experience that is our

184
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,880
primary experience the things that arise in our experience before we add stress

185
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,640
to them before we get caught up in them in that direct experience we can have

186
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:17,160
absolute confidence and that's one of the reasons we keep going back there in the meditation and it's not important

187
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:23,119
that we're not there all the time this isn't the practice isn't about hanging on with you know by our fingernails to

188
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,440
the breath it's about coming back to the breath over and over again again the

189
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:34,000
sense of return the sense of rebalance the sense of refreshment and pleasure

190
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,160
that come from coming back to here and now that's the manner in which we remind

191
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:44,920
ourselves of this innate capacity to be here and as we come back each time and

192
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,319
we reconnect with direct experience our confidence can grow oh this is what's

193
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:58,319
happening now and we can start to feel that what what's happening now is what's

194
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:05,040
what's meant to be happening in the practice it's not supposed to be otherwise we don't have to exclude

195
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:12,960
anything that comes up in the meditation none of which practically none of which is random as being not appropriate here

196
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:20,359
the things that come up and the things even that draw us away those things want attention they they want the gift of our

197
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:25,599
attention and once given the gift of attention they ease up we can come back

198
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:31,119
to Center we'll talk about that particular aspect

199
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,160
of the five faculties later in the week

200
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,279
so what does it mean to have confidence or trust in direct

201
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,880
experience I like to think that the things that draw us away from the here and

202
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:55,599
now these are things that they have sort of a destabilizing effect they knock us

203
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:03,760
off center they they take us away from the um Natural Balance that we can find

204
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:11,280
within they um distract us from a wholesome quality of mind and a

205
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,920
way of knowing experience that is naturally

206
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,160
free and they can uh in various ways make us feel either that we don't belong

207
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:34,119
in in the practice or we don't even belong in our own experience or that we don't have what it

208
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:41,800
takes to be free and to the extent that we engage in

209
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:48,040
those kinds of um thought patterns we uh sort of diminish our own

210
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:55,319
capacity to to be confident in what we can know directly in our experience

211
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:06,079
so when we return to here and now we um reconnect with the experience

212
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:14,359
of this moment it's like this now we can use phrases to remind oursel

213
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:19,920
that this is the way it's supposed to be in the practice this practice that's

214
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,920
developing right now is the one that um is the right one the correct one

215
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:35,000
the skill skillful one and we can um trust what we what we

216
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,560
come to know in the meditation I think the particular thing

217
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,359
I'd point to today and this can be a little challenging for people perhaps who come

218
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:52,079
from some of our backgrounds certainly for me is it

219
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:59,359
something I tried to point to and the guided to this morning is just that we can trust the pleasure that's there in

220
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,880
the meditation the um the pleasure of the

221
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,560
meditation which the Buddha encourages us to

222
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,560
cultivate the Buddha says in various various places um that this pleasure of

223
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,480
meditation this pleasure that comes from connecting with our direct experience the here and

224
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,599
now this pleasure is to be cultivated this pleasure is not to be feared

225
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:34,440
this pleasure is part of the path and that's because the pleasure of

226
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:41,520
the meditation doesn't depend on anything outside US doesn't depend on external

227
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:48,319
conditions but rather is something that comes from within and something as a result that we can trust that we can

228
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:55,760
have confidence in and as we become more intimate with

229
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:02,560
our experience we can lean into that pleasure that accompanies the return to

230
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,359
Here and Now and there's actually something quite

231
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:14,839
important going on in the brain here the brain uses pleasure and and pain as

232
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:23,880
important signals and what we're doing is retraining a bit the brain or um

233
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:31,240
we're we're um encouraging the mind to notice that ah it's

234
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:39,720
pleasurable to be here now and as we do that we um reinforce

235
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:47,240
that that important signal in the mind that this is a place to find home that this is a place we can trust and this is

236
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:52,280
this can be challenging because sometimes we we quite um understandably

237
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:58,240
and rightfully we are hesitant to um to

238
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:05,720
take pleasure in things because sometimes it leads us astray sometimes we find that uh we're caught up in

239
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:13,640
seeking pleasurable uh experiences Peak experiences in um in ways that are

240
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:19,640
harmful to ourselves or others and so this is an important reminder that this

241
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:26,480
experience in the meditation of making direct connection with our um with our

242
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:33,280
lives with the Here and Now of our experience whatever is going on trusting that the

243
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:40,839
practice brings up brings us uh into the experiences that need

244
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:50,440
attention um this particular uh signaling does point in a in a wholesome

245
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,160
Direction and I promised at the outset that one thing I would do in these five days is

246
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:07,280
reflect on the way most recently Gil has captured these um these five faculties

247
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:13,920
this faculty this internal capacity this this ability to be present in this way

248
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,079
this first faculty is frequently referred to as confidence or trust or

249
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:24,319
faith this is something that we're reminded as the practice develops this

250
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:29,920
direct experience is something we can have complete faith and confidence and Trust

251
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:38,839
in the word that Gil has recently used to gloss to um characterize this faculty

252
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:45,760
is love and uh it's it's a wonderful thing

253
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:53,200
uh to recognize as Gil does that this ability to feel comfortable and

254
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,520
confident to have confidence to have trust and faith in our direct experience

255
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:07,559
of Life free allows us to it that it in a sense is a form of

256
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:14,359
love and that it frees us up to share our love with

257
00:45:14,359 --> 00:45:21,800
others when we're confident in what we experience we can share it openly share

258
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:30,520
it freely and it allows us to connect with others and it allows us to um get get

259
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:37,680
out of Our Own Way in a way that allows us to be present for

260
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:45,760
others so this first faculty this first inner resource this first um capacity of

261
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:53,040
mind is to be comfortable and confident enough in our own

262
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:59,960
experience that we are engaged in a form of of deep

263
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:06,319
appreciation for the simple ability to be present in

264
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:12,839
our lives intimate with our experience and share that with with

265
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:19,359
others in the world so as we go forward this week we'll continue to look at each of these

266
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:26,960
in a way that hopefully is very um really comes right out of the meditation that we engage in together and that all

267
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,559
also connects with some of these recent um more recent ways that Gil

268
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:41,400
characterizes these five spiritual faculties or five human Divine faculties as I'm as

269
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:47,800
I'm characterizing them this week all right uh best wishes to everyone for the

270
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:53,440
day and I look forward to connecting again tomorrow morning

271
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:01,440
tomorrow we'll return to the idea of balance the second second faculty is energy viia

272
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,520
and we'll take a look at how energy uh plays an important role in The

273
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:13,200
Meditation practice and also in how we how we can balance our energies

274
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,640
throughout throughout our engagement in in daily life so take care till tomorrow

275
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,000
morning
