1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,160
so good morning everyone and maybe we'll use this as a sound check

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,760
that uh see if uh you can hear me and also if uh

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:28,599
it's a relatively buzz free compared to what it has been and then we'll start in a minute or so

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,559
great so wonder oh wonderful thank you

5
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,800
and um

6
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,359
so

7
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,799
so starting uh this morning's meditation with an image

8
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,880
and the image is that of maybe uh taking a

9
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:27,360
flat stone kind of stone that you would maybe skip along the top of the surface of water

10
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,640
and you just kind of drop that stone uh into

11
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,840
a pond into a lake and the paw and the stone just kind

12
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,479
of falls down into the depths of this of the pond

13
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:51,520
to the depths of the lake and settles in the bottom and rests there quietly

14
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,560
so that image for meditation practice

15
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,840
that we are settling ourselves

16
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,759
and placing our attention within in a certain way and letting it just settle

17
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:14,640
drop and come to rest settle down and

18
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,280
there's a way in which even if the attention might is focused on sounds the world around us for

19
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,200
meditation some people do that there is a way in which the quality of attention

20
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,519
the source of attention um becomes intimate

21
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,360
we kind of drop within a certain way to a place to a reservoir to a lake where

22
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,000
attention can rest in a vast kind of spacious

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,239
space like a like a beautiful open lake when i was a

24
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,560
small child at 10 or 11 12 i i spent a lot of time

25
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:06,319
at the seashore swimming and i would love to dive deep deep wasn't that deep maybe five six feet seven feet deep into

26
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,480
the water and to the bottom and turn around and look up and it was so peaceful and i would see

27
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,120
the waves kind of going around up above me but where i was it was so peaceful and calm

28
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,799
so to to find ourselves inward in a certain way

29
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:32,720
in that peaceful calm place where awareness can be open to our experience

30
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,000
and so

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,080
to assume a meditation posture

32
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:52,000
and you know any posture will do that supports you to be alert

33
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,080
sitting upright has some advantages and in terms of this image maybe it's a

34
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,080
little bit easier to imagine this the stone of awareness just dropping

35
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,760
to some deep place inside

36
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,840
when you're sitting and then maybe you can let your gaze

37
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,320
relax and focus downwards at about 45 degrees maybe the eyelids become kind of half

38
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,320
closed and not really looking at anything in particular

39
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,520
letting the eyes rest in their sockets if it helps them relax you can even

40
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,280
imagine that your eyes are gently looking backwards or downwards

41
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,520
into your body and if it's nice for you you can also

42
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,080
close your eyes

43
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,639
and it's a ancient

44
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,759
technique for getting settled is to take long slow deep breaths at the

45
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,960
beginning but deep breaths that are long breaths that

46
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,120
are relaxed easy gentle

47
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,759
just far enough that there's no strain or we don't get winded or

48
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,039
and as you take the deep breaths in to relax your torso your so your belly

49
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:41,120
expands out your chest expands outwards

50
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:52,120
there's even the back rib cage you can maybe feel them expand as you breathe in

51
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,520
and then as you exhale also a longish exhale

52
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,520
relax the easy about it but maybe longer than you normally would

53
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,800
exhale but not to the point of it being a strain

54
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:21,240
just as long as it's comfortable deep in breath deep out breath

55
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,840
at the beginning of a sitting it's sometimes nice also with the long deep breaths

56
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,520
to take a few moments to pause at the end of the out breath

57
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,880
however long these moments are comfortable for you easy for you

58
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,759
without a strain without getting agitated but to pause

59
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,360
in that quiet in the way the body becomes still

60
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,400
and as the body becomes still and quiet perhaps you can allow your thinking bind

61
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,720
to also become quieter and stiller

62
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,840
attuning yourself to the physical

63
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,479
stillness

64
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:28,960
like you're listening to a musical note someone is playing and you tune your guitar to that note

65
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:36,400
tune your voice to that note so you tune your mind

66
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:44,039
to the quiet and stillness that's within

67
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,478
then letting your breathing return to normal

68
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:58,360
on the exhale relaxing the muscles of the face

69
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:15,039
on the exhale softening relaxing the shoulders

70
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,840
on the exhale softening the belly

71
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:47,279
and then see if you can find within a still quiet place it's any place in

72
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,320
your body that you associate with

73
00:08:52,320 --> 00:09:00,399
stillness quiet peacefulness or calm

74
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,880
whether or not you feel it now is there a place inside you associate

75
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,839
with those states

76
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:31,040
and then in a moment i'll ask you to take a deep in in-breath and on the long exhale

77
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,880
imagine you're dropping a stone into a lake and stone settles to the bottom the same

78
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:47,120
way let your mind become quiet and settled

79
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:55,200
dropping it close to this place of quiet within resting in the inner stillness

80
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,640
so taking a deep breath exhaling and dropping yourself into your

81
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:08,519
body to the place of quiet and stillness calm

82
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,079
and letting your breath return to normal

83
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,839
relaxing on the exhale

84
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:44,000
relaxing the thinking mind and relax into the inner quiet

85
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,640
of breathing in and out softly gently

86
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:18,959
then gently continue with your breathing perhaps if it's easy breathing

87
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:25,320
together with the inner quiet or stillness or peacefulness

88
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,920
whenever you are exhaling letting go of your thoughts

89
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,200
there's nothing you need to think about except staying close

90
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:53,839
to the quiet stillness of breathing mindfully

91
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,240
in your body

92
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,920
you

93
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,920
you

94
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,918
you

95
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:34,000
every time you exhale see if you can let go of your thoughts

96
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,679
and let your attention drop relax into

97
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:49,480
a place of quiet stillness within like a rock dropping into a lake

98
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,919
uh

99
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,520
relaxing your thinking mind on the exhale

100
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:52,880
and noticing has there been any shift

101
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:59,679
in your mind state from the beginning of the meditation to the end

102
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,440
the quality of your mind or your mood mental mood

103
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,919
or your mental attitude is anything shifted

104
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,080
and if it has

105
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:29,080
is there a new perspective that provides it is beneficial for you

106
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,080
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

107
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,799
to turn your thoughts your concerns your vision

108
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,639
out into the world around you

109
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:45,120
and is there some way that you can stay close to a quiet still place within

110
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:52,320
or whatever way that you benefited from the meditation not to lose that

111
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,279
but to become aware be reminded

112
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,440
of the tremendous suffering in our world

113
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,720
the struggles of covid and so many hospitals around the world

114
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,200
so many bedsides

115
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,799
challenges of fires and

116
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:28,960
floods hurricanes heat

117
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:36,399
war earthquakes

118
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:44,039
we live in a world where these are parts of our world

119
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:54,559
and from our meditation can we gaze upon it kindly

120
00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:03,120
can we gaze upon it with eyes that are supportive and inclined to help and to care

121
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:12,840
without becoming anxious without becoming despondent

122
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:19,520
but from our meditation to just say relaxed and simple

123
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:27,799
kind of ease and simplicity of looking upon the suffering of the world

124
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:34,240
and then wishing that we as individuals and as a

125
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,039
community and as a world

126
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:47,760
can live for the welfare and happiness of the world can we contribute to it

127
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,600
may all beings be happy

128
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,000
may all beings be safe

129
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:06,080
may all beings be peaceful

130
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,720
may all beings be free

131
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:25,460
[Music]

132
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:28,559
so on this monday

133
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:34,640
start a new series of new theme for the week and the theme will be the third

134
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:41,120
foundation of mindfulness so the classic teachings on mindfulness is taught by

135
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,039
the buddha comes from a discourse called the four foundations of mindfulness

136
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:53,440
and and therefore domains areas of our life where within with which we develop our

137
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,559
mindfulness our awareness so it becomes strong and clear lucid

138
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:06,320
relaxed and these four are the body

139
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:13,440
the feeling tones of our experience pleasant unpleasant neutral the state of minds that we have

140
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:20,960
and the dhammas the the uh mental operations activities

141
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,880
with which we either get pulled into the world of suffering

142
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,120
or get pulled out of it into the world of freedom and

143
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,640
the um so this week we'll talk about the third foundation

144
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,480
in july the theme for one week was um the the

145
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:53,360
first foundation and talked about some other teachings there and it was in june i think and then in

146
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:00,080
july at the the topic was uh there was a week where i did the feeling tones

147
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,000
and then i wa in august i talked about for one week each the greed hatred and

148
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,200
delusion and their opposites and that was actually meant to be a preparation for talking about the third

149
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:20,240
foundation and um and so with um

150
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:27,600
and now i'm following up on the third foundation and so i feel a little bit sorry that maybe they're not

151
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,000
these these series and the four foundations of mindfulness are not uh right after each other so that they

152
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,640
make sense to build but a good number of you are familiar with your four foundations so maybe you can

153
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:47,360
just pick up here on the third foundation i like to think of these

154
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:53,120
four foundations as kind of providing a kind of like a path uh i just really

155
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:59,200
like the metaphor of depth so i apologize for those of you who don't like this kind of metaphor going in going deep

156
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,720
but another way metaphors out of intimacy that

157
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:11,919
with the first foundation uh we can be very intimate with our body but the focus is on the body

158
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:18,480
and uh the coarser experience and sometimes some of the exercises actually to be aware of the body in activity as

159
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,520
we're walking laying down and sitting eating just be aware of the body

160
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,440
and some of the exercises are involve reflections considering the body

161
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:38,320
developing a new relationship with the body that's helpful and um but so it's a little bit uh

162
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,878
and it you know provisionally will say a little bit coarser attention more obvious more

163
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:51,839
you know something solid you can maybe connect to as we connect to the body and get

164
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:57,760
intimate to us intimate to it then we start becoming aware of the subjective

165
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,839
experience of pleasant and unpleasant that comes along with being grounded in the body

166
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,960
and it's subjective so it's a little bit deeper than the body it has to do with the interface between

167
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,320
a lot of our inner mental life and the sensations that we experience and that

168
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,000
interface we can experience it as either things as pleasant or unpleasant

169
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,320
and enjoyable not enjoyable comfortable not comfortable and now we're getting something closer

170
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:32,720
something that in some ways is more meaningful and more impactful for us because as to it pleasant and

171
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:39,040
unpleasant there can be a lot of pain for example or a lot of pleasure that's felt

172
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,800
and then as we settle into that and we start discovering that um there's

173
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:52,720
different two different kinds of pleasant and unpleasant there's that which has to do with the body itself and

174
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:59,440
this ordinary senses like so if i pinch myself it hurts or if i get a massage it

175
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,599
feels good and and i'm sitting in a cold room i might be uncomfortable sitting in a

176
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:12,000
comfortable temperature room i feel i can relax perhaps a cold day the warmth feels very nice

177
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,119
and soothing and so um so there's that has to do with stimulating the ordinary senses of the

178
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,560
body but as we settle in in meditation we become aware that there's a deeper

179
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,839
sense of a pleasant unpleasant having to do with in modern world

180
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:36,720
language might call it our psychology though with our inner mind state our inner state of being i like the

181
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:42,880
expression state of being and i know it's kind of a vague expression and not everyone understands

182
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,000
what it means perhaps but the the quality the characteristics of our

183
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,800
state of being that's independent on whether the world is providing us with pleasure

184
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,800
or with pain and so this inner sense of well-being inner state of being

185
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:07,359
is getting closer and deeper and more intimate with us and this state of being now as we is

186
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:12,640
become aware of it this is very closely connected or maybe the same thing as

187
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,880
the state of mind a state of mind the word is chitta

188
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,280
c-i-t-t-a it's a very important word in the term in the teachings of the buddha it's

189
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,960
sometimes translated as mind sometimes it's translated as state of mind

190
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,960
sometimes it's uh translated as thinking thought and so it's different context it means

191
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,400
kind of it's cons that's the constellation of things that the word kind of points to

192
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,240
but it points to i like state of mind or quality of mind or quality of being it's

193
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,839
the mood overall mood or attitude through which we're aware of things

194
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:58,160
so for example if i'm angry i can be angry

195
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:04,560
as a flare-up in the moment about something in particular and then it goes away and i'm

196
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,760
my basic disposition hasn't changed but when my disposition becomes an angry

197
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,359
disposition then we say that the state of mind has become angry the inner quality the

198
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:21,839
quality of our being has a kind of characterized by anger it's an attitude

199
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:29,119
or a mood that we carry with us that is more enduring than the flare-ups of the moment

200
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,320
so the same thing if i feel just tremendous goodwill

201
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,160
for that goodwill you know is not just that then it's not just a momentary goodwill

202
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:47,359
and some encounter that i have but there's a disposition of goodwill that characterizes the

203
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:53,920
state of being the mood the state of mind that we have

204
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,640
maybe for some of you it might be meaningful to know that some people translate the word cheetah

205
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:05,760
c-i-t-t-a as heart and so it's this quality of our heart

206
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,040
and now with this third foundation where we focus on this state of mind or state of heart

207
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:17,280
state of our inner being now we're getting much more intimate we're getting into something that's uh

208
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,320
uh much more impactful closer into what feels most intimate

209
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,839
with us that's not have not not so tied to the vagaries of changing phenomena in the

210
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:35,200
world and a place where has a big impact on our mood our sense of well-being where

211
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,240
we might feel a pervasive feeling of dread or basic

212
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:47,040
feeling of of greed or wanting desperate wanting for something

213
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,880
or we might feel a pervasive mood of ill will hostility

214
00:39:52,880 --> 00:40:00,079
where we might feel the opposite of that we might feel a tremendous mood or attitude of

215
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:06,160
of uh generosity and open-heartedness where we might feel

216
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,960
love or kindness good will and so um so now this is the mind state

217
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,880
and so as we settle and get quieter and quieter maybe the breathing gets quieter the

218
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:25,839
body comes still and quieter we feel at ease it relaxed and now things are comfortable

219
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:32,640
and enough that we start noticing what stands out and highlight is this

220
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,079
inner disposition this mood the mind state the heart state how we are and

221
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:44,319
sometimes we discover that that's a difficult place there's all kinds of ways with which

222
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:50,400
our inner life people try to avoid it they don't want to know it they stay busy so they don't feel it because

223
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,920
there might be some real sadness or grief there or something we're very much afraid of or

224
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,520
some inner sense of conflict between different parts of ourselves but to

225
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:08,000
start becoming aware of this deeper interstate that we have it allows the healing to unfold it

226
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,920
allows the purification the term that's often used in buddhism purifying ourselves of the

227
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,359
of the afflictive states that we have and buddhism in that sense is very

228
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,400
optimistic it's very encouraging that it is possible to

229
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:33,839
change ourselves that we're never stuck in any particular mood any particular mind state that is afflictive

230
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:40,640
that it that harms us that is difficult to be with but that there is a path through it

231
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,560
and uh recently we've talked about faith and talked about patience and

232
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,800
these are all important states and qualities for being able to work with these deeper mind states

233
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,359
to have a lot of faith in the value of practice and enter into it uh to have a lot of patience with what

234
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:05,440
is difficult for us and and then it's possible to work through

235
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,839
these work through or open up or settle the afflictive mind states settles a good

236
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:18,800
term because afflictive mind states involve a certain kind of overactivity of the mind

237
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,440
it's a there's action activity of the mind that's generating boredom generating

238
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:32,400
hatred or ill will generating fear despair and as the mind gets quieter and stiller

239
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:39,200
that activity settles away and we experience ourselves without those afflictive mind states

240
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,920
and as we do so there's two different things that can happen

241
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,119
either we start making room in our hearts for the opposite of the

242
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,319
afflictive states to begin to appear generosity love wisdom

243
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:02,240
that's one thing that can happen the other is that uh the mind state itself begins the

244
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:10,839
quality or the characteristic of it the texture of it begins to change where it starts becoming expansive open

245
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:16,880
uh if it starts feeling it an ease that's related to freedom and

246
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:23,359
like the mind the heart can now breathe easily because it feels free and unrestricted

247
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:29,040
and these are also all these things are part of mindfulness of the mind state the third foundation

248
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:34,079
becoming mindful of mind states that are afflictive those that are the opposite of

249
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:40,960
afflictive and those that come as the mind becomes freer and freer and to feel this freedom of mind state

250
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,880
freedom of heart is one of the great important teachers

251
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,960
for us on this path of mindfulness we become our own teacher as we begin

252
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,680
recognizing the very changing states of mind that we're capable of having and beginning to notice and

253
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:06,720
appreciate ones that support the movement towards freedom and wisdom and compassion and

254
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:13,440
care and such things so that's the introduction for this theme for this week

255
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,720
and uh and i look forward to sharing this important

256
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:24,880
part and i'll say to end it that

257
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,079
what we're looking at when we look at the mind state or the heart state that we have

258
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,359
is the quality of our inner state quality very inner being

259
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:43,760
and and it turns out that we are we are the primary or maybe the only custodian

260
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,920
of our inner well-being and so it isn't if we if we assume other people

261
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,160
are custodian of it and our inner well-beings depend on how other people treat us or what they do

262
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:03,520
for us then it's not really a reliable place to find happiness and well-being

263
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:10,640
but to learn through mindfulness to be the custodian of our own well-being is what's possible with this um a third

264
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:18,920
foundation of mindfulness so we'll talk more this week so thank you very much
