1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:07,640
okay so we'll start with a guided

2
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:20,160
meditation taking a few longer breaths than we normally

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,720
would as a way to just help connect with the body

4
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:52,480
and feeling what it feels like have these bigger

5
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,199
breaths feeling the stretch and the release of the

6
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:06,680
stretch maybe there's a little bit of ease and relaxation that comes with the

7
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:18,439
exhale allowing the breath to return to normal no need to control the

8
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:24,720
breath just trusting that the body knows how to breathe

9
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,438
then feeling connected to our sitting surface we're

10
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,119
here feeling the pressure against the Bucks pressure from the couch or the

11
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,000
chair or the cushion

12
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,599
pressure on the back of the

13
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,560
legs and feeling whatever the feet are touching

14
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,800
and be really upful to establish this

15
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Foundation of our sitting surface at the beginning of a sit

16
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,640
helps emphasize that we are here and

17
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:16,760
now and there's a way in which the posture can rise out of that

18
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,799
foundation in the spine

19
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,080
straight and upright of course it's fine if you're

20
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,760
lying down also

21
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:44,920
if you're using a back rest feeling the pressure against the

22
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,840
back on the and the pressure on the body

23
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,759
and doing a gentle body

24
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,000
scan to tuning into the sensations on the

25
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:44,639
face around the eyes around the jaw maybe the face itself

26
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:18,160
the shoulders allowing them to be relaxed away from the ears

27
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:39,919
and the chest is there a way there can be some

28
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,319
softness in the chest

29
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,160
and the belly letting it

30
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,160
relax soften

31
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,360
now that we've settled in a little

32
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:54,080
bit I'd like to ask you to feel the sensations in the right hand

33
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:08,680
there are two kinds maybe the sensations of what the hand is

34
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,960
touching whether that's warm or cool

35
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,919
soft or rough

36
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,680
and the sensations of having a hand

37
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,280
maybe that's more like a tingling or a somehow a

38
00:07:50,280 --> 00:08:01,440
vibratory sense the experience of having a hand

39
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,240
those are what I would call the direct experience

40
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:37,360
and in contrast you think about

41
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:47,959
hands think about an evolution having posable thumbs turns out to be mightily

42
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,720
helpful the hands of a child are different than the hands of an adult

43
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:03,720
different sizes with maybe a little bit softer and

44
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:24,920
pudgier and then just noticing that thoughts about

45
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,959
hands is not the same as experiences

46
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,320
with

47
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,680
hands distinct from the direct

48
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,360
experience e

49
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,440
we can notice during this meditation

50
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,120
period how sometimes thoughts are

51
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,800
predominant and sometimes direct experience is

52
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
predominant e

53
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,079
we'd like to give emphasis to

54
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:50,279
experience experiencing the sensations of

55
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
breathing e

56
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:59,720
feeling into the body's movements

57
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,680
as breathing

58
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
happens

59
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

60
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

61
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040

70
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:41,320
the is lost in thought we don't have to make a big

71
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:49,279
story about what it means us as

72
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,880
meditators we just begin again with the

73
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,640
experience of breathing

74
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640

90

91
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:57,670
[Music]

92
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:09,760
morning welcome welcome today am continuing this um

93
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:17,159
exploration of this topic of stories and in that guided meditation I

94
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:23,159
try to highlight the difference between thoughts that we

95
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:28,360
have and experience like direct experience

96
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:35,480
I wean can notice that you know thoughts of course are be different places different times Future Past complete

97
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:43,440
fantasy whereas experience is just right here right now of course it

98
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,039
is and another distinction that maybe it's so obvious that

99
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:54,880
um it isn't even worth mentioning but there's a way in which thoughts use

100
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,279
language like uh whether it's sexual words or maybe it's images whereas

101
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:05,799
direct experience itself isn't so much a language it's

102
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:13,518
just an experience right when we put our hand and touch our sitting

103
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,440
surface and just feel rubbing our hand moving our hand across the surface just

104
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:26,080
feeling there's just those Sensations whereas if we were to

105
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:33,399
describe it or something like that you then we're we're a little bit removed we're using language to uh describe

106
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:40,120
it so as that as an introduction um I'd like to tell a story that um comes from

107
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,880
the poly Canan from the sutas and um I'll talk a little bit more about the

108
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:52,519
role of stories or how humans use stories after I give a story so this

109
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:58,840
story is about maluna those of you who are interested this comes from majima 6

110
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:04,639
three and uh maluna he was a monastic under the Buddha so he had ordained

111
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:11,760
under the Buddha and one time uh he goes to the Buddha and he says you know I'm

112
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:18,559
really not happy that you haven't explained everything and I'm going to disrobe I'm going to leave the monastic

113
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:27,120
life I'm going to abandon this monastic life and become a late person again unless you answer these 10 uh questions

114
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,519
these turn out to be metaph physical questions like an example of some of

115
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:38,840
these questions are is the world finite or infinite so he just has these

116
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:47,840
questions about space where where's the how much space is there in this universe or in these world of ours Malia also

117
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:55,279
asks is the world Eternal or not Eternal he's asking about time like where is

118
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:00,919
time how much time is there and he's asking uh also like what

119
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:07,240
happens to Buddhas after they die where do they go do they exist or do they not

120
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:14,519
exist so you can see that these are the type of questions that are you know only in one's mind in terms like wanting to

121
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:20,200
know like the limits of time and space and what happens after

122
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:27,639
death and uh some little like this little detail that I kind of like in this story is I feel like maluta he's a

123
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:35,000
little Bit Sassy he says to the Buddha if you don't know the answers to

124
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,440
these things then just simply say you don't know so he's kind of like goting

125
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:48,679
the Buddha a little bit and saying you know if you don't know just say it he's uh suggesting that the Buddha doesn't

126
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:54,519
know and then the Buddha replies well did I ever promise you that I was going

127
00:32:54,519 --> 00:33:00,000
to answer all these questions if you ordained did I ever did I promise anyone

128
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,279
that I would give all the answers to every single metaphysical question that they could come up with if they ordained

129
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,799
no I never made that promise and in fact if somebody were demanding this of me

130
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:19,919
that they would not ordain until I had answered all their metaphysical questions then they would never ordain

131
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:26,360
and they would die they would spend the rest of their life unordained and they would die

132
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,639
unordained and then the G says know I don't answer these questions because

133
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:38,039
these answers to these types of questions is not helpful and it doesn't

134
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:43,639
lead to peace it doesn't lead to Insight it doesn't lead to

135
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:49,960
Awakening so just having the answers to these type of metaphysical metaphysical

136
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:57,000
questions and I might say having the story about what happens after death

137
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,240
story about the limits of the universe space and time where are there edges if

138
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:10,760
so where are they isn't helpful instead it's uh about uh what

139
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:16,158
can lead to peace insight and Awakening which is direct

140
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,079
experience and then the bruda continues within this story The bruda

141
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:28,638
gives another story it's a aimile which we might understand as a as a story and

142
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:35,480
the simile goes like this is this is the simile of The Poisoned Arrow this is the

143
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:41,878
budha talking to malapa and says Suppose there was a person who was injured by a poisoned

144
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:47,158
arrow and his friends and relatives bring a doctor to help remove the arrow

145
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:55,720
you in order to save his life but this person refuses doesn't want any help from the doctor until certain questions

146
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:02,079
are answered and and these are the types of questions who shot the arrow were

147
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,720
they tall or short or of middle height do they live in this city or do they

148
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:13,079
live in this town or do they live in a village and what kind of bow was used to

149
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:20,440
show shoot the arrow was it a longbow or a crossbow and what kind of bow string

150
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:26,520
was on the bow was it made from fiber or Reed or sinu and what kind of feathers

151
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:33,880
were on the bow were they from a vulture a heron a hawk a peacock or a stor and

152
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:40,839
what kind of arrowead was it spiked or razor tipped was it curved was it Barbed

153
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:49,000
was it Lancet shaped you know so all these from a you in modern years these are and I'm assuming also back in

154
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,520
thousands of years ago when this Sim was given these are irrelevant questions

155
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:00,200
here's a person who's been hit with a poisoned Arrow there's like poison going

156
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:06,280
into them they're soon to die and they're wondering what whether

157
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,559
the bow string was made from fiber read or

158
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:19,520
sineu so the obvious like the the teaching point from uh this Su both

159
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,160
maluna asking these questions and the simile of the poison to Arrow is that um

160
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,680
having answers stories I might say about um so many of

161
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:41,760
the things that we have um are is not the way to Awakening isn't the way towards

162
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,839
Liberation but instead that there's a real encouragement to focus on Direct

163
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:52,400
experience that we can have through meditation or ethical conduct or the way

164
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:59,440
that we're showing up in the world so rather than becoming a atted to

165
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:06,400
having the answers to all of our metaphysical questions or knowing

166
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,319
everything rather than being attached to speculative views

167
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:17,880
stories there's this real emphasis on no just have some clarity about what's

168
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:24,040
actually happening some mindfulness about what's happening in one's

169
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:31,560
life so that's the usual uh framing of this uh story that we find in the uh

170
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:39,720
sutas but I also want to kind of like zoom out and look at this uh story from

171
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:47,040
a different perspective and to ask why is maluta and

172
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:54,960
this poisoned Arrow victim why would they even want to know all these things what's the reason I know that

173
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,640
this is a you know a teaching story but I I want us to maybe like look at things from a different

174
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:07,400
way why why would they even want to know whether the bow string was made out of

175
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:14,760
senine or Fiber why would they want to know whether the world has the space is

176
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:20,480
infinite or finite because they think that if they're they're trying to make sense of

177
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,520
their experience they think that if they have more information they'll find Freedom

178
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:32,160
they'll be a little bit more ease if they just understood better in some ways we they kind of want to create a story

179
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:38,760
about why it happened and so maybe maybe malapa maybe

180
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,960
he was just having a lot of doubt maybe he was like a hindrance a doubt hindrance attack and he had this idea

181
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:52,680
that well maybe if I just had some more confidence in the Buddha and his teachings then this would be easier for

182
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:58,839
me maybe if I uh he could prove that uh he really was awakened by knowing the

183
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:05,480
answers to these questions it would be a little bit easier for me and this is what humans

184
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:11,880
do we want to use stories to make sense of our

185
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,079
world we want to have information we want to feel like we understand maybe

186
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:22,560
there's some way in which we feel like we can control things if we understand

187
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,800
them and David ly he writes the world is made of stor

188
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,838
and then he's saying like we're creating our world with our

189
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,440
stories and we can even think like in modern times like how we have this current news cycle which you know is

190
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,800
just never ending it just seems like okay something happens and then there's

191
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:53,280
endless speculation like immediately after it happens about people are you know getting paid to just be on air to

192
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:00,440
completely speculate about the details and the motive and trying to make sense before any of the data any of the facts

193
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:06,319
have rolled in they're just speculating and so they're just trying

194
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:12,079
to uh give some information or trying to help us make sense of like wait wh why

195
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,119
did this happen and David L he points out it's

196
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:24,520
not just like the news cycle he's talking about here's these other ways of stories that make our

197
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,000
world there's this long list which I I like I think it's uh really points to

198
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,839
how pervasive this idea is of how humans use stories to make

199
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:43,119
sense the stories that make our world are creation myths folk tales and fairy

200
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:50,480
tones 17 syllable Japanese haiku and three-day Indonesian shadow puppet

201
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:58,040
dramas novels romantic fantastic graphic television soap operas

202
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:06,520
newspaper features oped articles internet blogs talk show chatter office memos

203
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,880
obituaries and birth announcements how to use manuals how you're feeling this

204
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:20,040
morning what happened during your vacation and what you're planning for the weekend so he's saying that this is all

205
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:25,839
this ways that uh using stories and maybe we might say it's a narratives

206
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:31,760
that we're trying to use to pull together our experiences like highlighting the

207
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:40,400
difference between an actual experience and then the words and the language the narratives that we use to explain

208
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,040
them and so I would say that freedom lies in

209
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:52,200
recognizing stories as stories so the problems lie not with stories themselves

210
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:58,560
but how we identify with them or how that we are uh um just believing them

211
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,640
and assuming that what we're hearing somehow is like an accurate representation of

212
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:11,440
experience because unaware that our stories are stories we usually experience them as well this is just the

213
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:18,680
way the world is and we take for granted that the world we experience is being

214
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:26,599
reflected in these narratives and stories these accounts that we're having

215
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:34,400
because the our stories our ideas about the world strongly affect our perception

216
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:41,520
of reality the way that we are interpreting or understanding what's valuable or

217
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:48,119
what's possible or what's good or what's bad are all dependent on these stories

218
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:55,800
that we are telling about our experience so don't believe everything

219
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:02,680
you think but but we don't want to also dismiss stories because it's a way that

220
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:10,000
we are trying to make sense of the world and to make sense of our experiences instead I would say the way

221
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,920
forward is to recognize that there are experiences and then there's the

222
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,800
narratives we create about experiences that both are important they

223
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:27,720
both have a role and they're distinct and it's helpful for us to keep that in

224
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:35,160
mind as we practice for more freedom more ease more peace

225
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:42,040
Awakening so thank you thank you and today you might just have a no notice

226
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:49,800
like what kind of like narratives are you pulling together and of course we are but can we recognize that they are

227
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:55,079
narratives that they explanations for experiences that we had and that they're

228
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:01,078
distinct so thank you and I'll see you

229
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:08,040
tomorrow wishing you all wonderful rest of the day thank

230
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,079
you e

231
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:03,400
it's lovely to uh see your comments it's it's so great R to

232
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:11,240
practice together makes a difference thank you

233
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:37,400
maybe in the same way that um I know that there's like a little time delay

234
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,880
between when I say something and when it shows up on YouTube which I was thinking

235
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:49,200
like maybe in the same way there's like their direct experience and then there's the narrative around it there's a like a

236
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,400
little Gap and because you guys might be able to see me but you don't know what

237
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,160
I'm reading what I'm seeing just because they this uh

238
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,440
delay may we all be well
