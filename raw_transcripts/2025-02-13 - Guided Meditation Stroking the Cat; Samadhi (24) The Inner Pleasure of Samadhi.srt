1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,240
warm greetings and so I want to say that it's

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:11,960
raining here and there's a teaching that the Dharma is like the rain in the

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,800
forest and that when it rains in the forest the each all the different plants

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,880
small plants Big Trees each of them absorbs the the amount of water they

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,560
need for their life and so when the uh when hearing the Dharma reading the

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:36,520
Dharma being in the Dharma each of us will take in what we need or at at any

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:45,160
given time and uh to trust that so the topic is

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:51,039
um this week around samade is organized under the category

9
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:58,719
of pleasure and it involves a range of certainly Sensations like Pleasant

10
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,879
Sensations but also involves emotions of things like gladness and joy and

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,560
happiness and even more intense forms of

12
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:19,200
well-being and uh in the teachings of the Buddha uh the condition

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,159
for um concentration is some form of

14
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,600
Happiness to really get absorbed in samadi for samadi really to arise as we

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,320
meditate is um to have some M come some form of

16
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:45,159
Happiness the the condition for happiness is to have some form of Tranquility or being relaxed at

17
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,479
ease and the condition for relaxation is some

18
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:57,680
joy and the condition for Joy is to have gladness a

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,399
delight and uh and so these are called the the gladness

20
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:09,759
pentad gladness can lead to Joy Joy to tranquility tranquility to Happiness and

21
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:18,120
happiness to samadi and some people find this strange because the whole reason to practice

22
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,440
meditation um and maybe have somebody is to be able to feel some deep sense of

23
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,959
wellbeing and here it's reverse order well-being first and then somebody

24
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,160
and this gladness pentad is said to begin by being inspired by

25
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,680
something uh uh one of The Inspirations is mudita kind of a appreciative Joy

26
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,360
appreciating others people's maturity and development in the Dharma practice

27
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:58,239
to see people becoming Freer more more self more more more uh at ease more

28
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,680
peaceful more have more Integrity somehow become Freer in the process of

29
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:12,959
practicing um can be very inspiring and to be delighted in this rather than jealous or envious uh to be inspired so

30
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:21,040
that gladness arises and that gladness then as we practice can be there uh creating space for some joy and joy some

31
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:28,519
space to relax in a deep way tranquility and then to happiness another source of inspiration

32
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:37,360
that's classic Buddhism is in the three refuges in refuge and the primary Refuge

33
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,879
is the mindfulness practice itself to have experienced or to know or to Intuit

34
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,920
it that this the practice of mindfulness practice of being attentive and clear

35
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,159
and being here um is such a blessing is such a

36
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,920
significant way of uh coming to Refuge where Refuge means a deep sense of being

37
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,239
at home in this world home with oneself a deep sense of belonging in this

38
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,760
universe belonging to oneself and to feel glad for

39
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:22,280
that and um and there are a few other things that are mentioned that uh one of them is ethics to be inspired by our own

40
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:29,520
ethical life for some people that's very hard to imagine just because we are sometimes

41
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,240
the the most the greatest critic of ourselves is ourselves but if we see read what's

42
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:42,520
going on in the newspapers and kind of news of of how unethical people can be

43
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,800
maybe it's easier to understand that uh you are a wonderful alternative to that

44
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,360
and be inspired by that glad for that so to be

45
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,039
inspired to feel a certain pleasure the pleasure of gladness

46
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,560
so to assume a meditation

47
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,840
posture and for people who meditate a lot the posture can be

48
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,360
just a habit of sitting into but for people who have been

49
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:27,280
meditating a lot it's also that they know the goodness of the posture they know the goodness of being in

50
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,479
this space of meditation and just sitting down at it if we take

51
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:40,000
the time to appreciate it can be an inspiration wow this is

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,960
good and I know I've been delighted and happy to sit down to meditate even when

53
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,360
I was not happy I was agitated upset things were difficult for me but wow was

54
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,800
it good to sit in the middle of it to sit who is so much better than the

55
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,880
alternative even better than being being distracted from

56
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,479
it gently closing the eyes and start by not doing

57
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:19,720
anything not meditating and simply checking

58
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:27,680
in checking in with yourself in your body how it is and your mind and your

59
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:35,000
heart or your emotions without beginning to meditate

60
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,560
without being mindful without concentrating on anything just allow

61
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,400
yourself to be as you are and check

62
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,280
in how are you here and

63
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,120
now answering that question with what is present for

64
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,520
you and maybe just maybe

65
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,960
appreciating the Simplicity of just being present and checking

66
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,759
in this is how it is

67
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:36,919
and then beginning to Center yourself on the

68
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,360
breathing checking in maybe you're still not meditating but now check in how is

69
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,599
your

70
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,720
breathing what parts of the body are active as you breathe

71
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,919
what Sensations come into play as you

72
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:17,720
breathe this simp the simple experience of

73
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:25,080
breathing breathing in breathing out the sensations that come into

74
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:36,719
play is probably the same or almost the same as what the Buddha experienced when

75
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,039
he sat down to meditate with his

76
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:49,959
breathing in a certain way you are sharing within

77
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:56,760
experience that the Buddha had and which practitioners down Through

78
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:03,160
the Ages have had practitioners

79
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,800
who've gone into a samade of

80
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,560
breathing to mature

81
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,839
deeply and

82
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,640
then if you have some feeling for not meditating just sitting here quietly

83
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,440
being being the breathing as it

84
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,720
is almost like the next thing to doing

85
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:50,160
nothing a gentle quiet becoming attuned to breathing

86
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,120
becoming centered more in the

87
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,320
breathing so that the attention to breath has a light

88
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,959
quality a light

89
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:19,480
touch where the awareness of breathing doesn't carry much

90
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,800
baggage of judging the breath or oneself straining or pushing for

91
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,720
something to happen expecting

92
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,879
anything just a light touch of awareness with breathing as it

93
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,639
is and no noticing if there is a settling point a

94
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:09,079
grounding Point deep within where the first

95
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:12,440
sensations of inhale

96
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,519
begin if it's if that place is in the

97
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:28,079
belly maybe there's a ever so slight lifting up out of that grounding

98
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:35,079
point as the inhale

99
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,399
spreads with the expanding rib

100
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,959
cage and then returning to that settling

101
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:56,440
place with the exhale

102
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,399
and gently

103
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,440
lightly be aware of the whole length of the

104
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:40,240
inhale the whole length of the exhale with the tenderness or the care

105
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,240
maybe even the love that you might

106
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:52,880
have in gently petting a cat stroking across the

107
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:02,720
hair going with the ground brain of the hair not against

108
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:12,199
it the inhale is a gentle stroke through the whole length

109
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:19,160
of the inhale and so is the exhale

110
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,079
and if there's any pleasure

111
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:49,440
pleasantness in mindfulness of breathing maybe letting it be the purr

112
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,160
of the cat a contented

113
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:04,360
per enjoyment of what is good or Pleasant about awareness of

114
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,360
breathing

115
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:43,560
and then you might try to have a small smile on your lips just big enough to feel some

116
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,600
sensations of

117
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:57,319
pleasure around the mouth the cheeks maybe even up into the eyes

118
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,759
and if you do feel that

119
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,519
pleasure can you connect that to something you're inspired with in

120
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:25,399
relationship to the practice something that brings you a

121
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:30,959
gladness glad that you're here doing this

122
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,839
practice with a small

123
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:49,600
smile that gives embodiment to that Delight

124
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:21,120
with a light touch of awareness writing the whole inhale the whole

125
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:30,040
exhale maybe a small smile supports the

126
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:39,519
the pleasure and goodness of relaxing into

127
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,199
breathing relaxing with the

128
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,759
exhale letting go of thoughts as you

129
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,639
exhale as you settle into the grounding

130
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,880
place e

131
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

132
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

133
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

134
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,640
for e

135
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:23,360
appreciating the pleasure of a light touch of attention

136
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,679
on breathing

137
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:36,400
allowing yourself to feel whatever pleasure there is of

138
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:40,480
meditation a

139
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,360
pleasure which helps the Mind feel more at

140
00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:01,919
ease that kind of ease that allows a thinking mind to be become quieter and

141
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:13,520
still and the pleasure of being present with the

142
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,679
breathing become

143
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,720
Central to our sense of being

144
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
here

145
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

146
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

147
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

148
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

149
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
e for

150
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,279
and as we come to the end of this

151
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:45,398
sitting to again as we began to sit here without

152
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,919
meditating just allow yourself to

153
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,240
be and without any formal meditation

154
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:05,679
letting awareness of just

155
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:15,559
being have the lightest possible touch not trying to do

156
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:20,480
anything not trying to get any change

157
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:28,880
anything a lot the lightest touch on this present moment experience

158
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,480
of just

159
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:47,919
being maybe awareness is like a gentle

160
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:54,480
breeze moving over the the

161
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,240
landscape of you just being here

162
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:22,799
and then with awareness together with

163
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:32,279
imagination having your awareness that breeze of awareness the lightest of

164

and with the lightest Touch of awareness know

168
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,518
them as they

169
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,679
are without being for or against without wanting or not wanting

170
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:24,519
anything just allowing people to be themselves

171
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:34,919
and then to spread that breeze of awareness out across the

172
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,158
lands may be a difficult task but

173
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:49,080
possible to allow all things all people just to be as they

174
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:58,240
are not because you agree or disagree with them or not be independent of your

175
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:05,240
discernment and judgments as if letting everything just

176
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:11,080
be as they are with it in the lightest Touch of

177
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,640
awareness is medicine for the

178
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,159
world is medicine for yourself

179
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:44,559
and may you have the wish if you like to go into the world

180
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,039
today thinking of yourself as medicine for the

181
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,120
world medicine for what ails Us in this

182
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,640
world and to go into the world with the medicine of Good

183
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:11,279
Will the medicine of being able to see people as they

184
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:20,200
are without preferences without judgments so there might be a hope for

185

thank you

195
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:36,519
so hello and welcome to this um 23rd the 24th talk I

196
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:41,760
think 23rd talk on

197
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:48,080
samat and um and there this week the topic is the

198
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:54,919
pleasure of somebody and pleasure takes different forms at different times sometimes it

199
00:32:54,919 --> 00:33:00,279
can feel like pure pleasure and um you know physical

200
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:08,240
pleasure and but it also can morph into the pleasure of delight the pleasure of

201
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:15,559
gladness the pleasure of Joy the pleasure of Happiness the pleasure of

202
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:24,200
Tranquility the pleasure of equinity the pleasure of release and

203
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,960
freedom and the pleasure of Refuge pleasure of

204
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:36,320
knowing we have a home that brings a certain degree of safety and Care

205
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:44,320
orientation meaning to this life of ours all kind of aspects of

206
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:51,080
refuge and so uh pleasure is an important part of Dharma practice and

207
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,200
maybe we can call it Dharma pleasure and in the teachings and

208
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:03,840
mindfulness the Buddha makes a distinction between two kinds of pleasure there's a pleasure that uh

209
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:11,440
comes from that can we can might want to call sensual pleasure if we uh

210
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,638
understand it to be that our senses are being stimulated by an external

211
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:23,520
source and um so if I eat a tasty food

212
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:32,200
that would be called sensual pleasure in The Taste because it comes from the food if um I stand in the warm sun on a cold

213
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:38,000
day and feel the pleasure of that that would be called sensual pleasure because it comes from outside and touches the

214
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,280
nerve endings and does something nice um if we're thinking about things

215
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,560
there's a way in which the thinking mind it's represents it's almost like

216
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,280
something outside of ourselves um I can have a fantasy about

217
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:03,640
something uh and the fantasy can bring a lot of pleasure and so what's it uh it's still

218
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,760
kind of on the outside the thinking sometimes certain kind of thinking uh is

219
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:17,160
on the surface and it kind of stimulates the surface pleasures of the mind um even though in in the and many

220
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,839
of us would think the mind is not part of the external world uh it's almost as

221
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:31,079
if certain kinds of surface thoughts our external World which are providing kind of an external stimulus to

222
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:36,200
things and uh there's not necessarily nothing wrong with that in any of this

223
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:45,359
but there is an an alternative which is uh pleasure which is not of the senses not of these the

224
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:53,599
sense doors that take in the external world but there is um uh the pleasure

225
00:35:53,599 --> 00:36:00,160
that it kind of arises uh in a more diffuse way that

226
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:10,000
that swells up emerge arises inside uh for as no particular

227
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:17,480
external reason that comes for meditation and so it's a whole radically

228
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:24,599
different pleasure because it doesn't depend on the world doesn't depend on getting the world in shape getting

229
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:30,599
everything just perfect in the world and feeling content and happy with how the world is and how our external

230
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:36,599
relationships are and everything but it comes with a kind of coming into

231
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:43,640
harmony with ourselves and and a deep inner sense of of a of a sensing the

232
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:49,440
beingness of our life as that beingness comes into harmony as that beingness

233
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:58,720
comes into a kind of um um uh tenderness or wholeness or uh um

234
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:06,240
uh orientation and and that feels very meaningful for example in

235
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:14,160
meditation and uh and so there are Pleasures in meditation that um are certainly welling

236
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:22,839
up and I'm sure there's some sense some nerve endings that are being stimulated but that um it's not because

237
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:29,520
they're kind of like stimulated from the outside in but rather from the inside in

238
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:38,319
uh something a deep welding and inspiration and um there's also in that uh unpleasant

239
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:44,680
Sensations that are of the senses that that come from the outer outer world or

240
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:50,440
thinking about the outer World um uh or there's uh unpleasant

241
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:56,359
Sensations that can well up that um are not of the world exactly not of the

242
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:01,960
sense world but to come also come from when we feel something is profoundly out

243
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,040
of alignment in this world and so there's a feeling of things something is not

244
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:14,800
right but in meditation what we're uh beginning to give birth to and this is a language the

245
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,000
Buddha used the language of birth we're giving birth to a deep sense Wellspring

246
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:29,119
of pleasure Well Spring of well-being in meditation and uh and this sense of

247
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,640
well-being is closely connected to a number of things it's connected to Faith

248
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:41,760
or inspiration or confidence that yes that's represented I

249
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,079
think with a big yes I'm here this is good I I know this world I'm inspired by

250
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:53,480
it I have refuge in it so that we're more kind of inclined towards being

251
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:59,280
present here for our experience rather than being present continue to be in the

252
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,280
thinking mind that's maybe thinking about the external world has this external relationship to everything a

253
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,520
disconnect to everything uh even and and even if we're thinking about you know something that

254
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:17,920
we did yesterday and maybe we did something that was harmful and we feel regret now if we spend too much time in

255
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:25,200
the in the imagination of that event we're kind of removed for something deeper here so the idea is to come into

256
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,920
this deeper place and um and so meditation there could be

257
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:37,240
a sense of well-being a sense of being at home goodness here an inspiration

258
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:44,240
about what this is about to meditate so faith and there can be uh an wonderful

259
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,960
sense of yes to being present for it the

260
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:56,000
effort the energy of it but here um they look for how

261
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,079
to apply app oneself in meditation so the very application itself is

262
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:09,400
enjoyable so maybe it's a very light touch maybe it's uh with inspiration

263
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,560
it's just a delight sometimes we can put a lot of energy into meditation and it

264
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,680
just feels like a play almost or feels like Delight to do it so we and

265
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:26,000
sometimes we and we need to do very very little effort to get that the best

266
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,480
results from meditation so finding how can you enjoy um being focused how can you enjoy

267
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:39,319
being present with attention and then there's mindfulness and mindfulness brings Joy because it

268
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:45,880
brings safety mindfulness uh we see everything clearly enough that we learn

269
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:52,640
to not pick up not continue involvement with things which are harmful for

270
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,079
ourselves mindfulness creates the open space in which things can just be and

271
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,079
evolve and change and we can learn to trust delightfully trust that if we're

272
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,920
present things move towards health and maybe not directly but over

273
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:18,440
time and then there is um samadi beginning to feel absorbed

274
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,920
connected here um kind of like the joy of a cat

275
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:30,319
that's being that's being petted stroked being able to really C Center ourselves

276
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:38,720
here and and uh feel begin to feel more whole more settled more calm there's a

277
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,920
strong correlation with samadi with calmness so as we get calmer meditation

278
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:50,200
that's the pleasure that we start appreciating and then there's the more

279
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:57,079
subtle pleasure of wisdom of of being able to be happy that

280
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:03,880
we we can see clearly enough to find the path to find our way meditation is

281
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,560
onward leading samade is an onward leading path where we kind of not that

282
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:14,640
we're expecting something or trying to make something happen but it's kind of

283
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,960
like we can see feel

284
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:26,359
sense here's where the path opens up here's where the slide top of the slide

285
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:34,400
is that'll take us deep you know on that wonderful Dharma slide or here's a path in the forest

286
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:42,720
maybe it's not so easy to see at first and we're lost but then we start seeing traces of the path ah and the the light

287
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:50,119
of knowing it maybe after being lost in the wilderness there's a great joy and likeness and pleasure of finally having

288
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:56,680
seen the path so the function of wisdom is to help us find that path between so

289
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:03,680
we don't get caught in attachments expectations aversions desires but we

290
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,880
see the path of what's wholesome what's good what's healthy for us healthy way

291
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:15,280
of being present a supportive way of entering the world of

292
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:21,640
Som so there's many forms of pleasure of goodness of rightness of

293
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:28,200
wholeness and one of those uh words that uh of this pleasure that that uh comes

294
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:34,720
along with time is harmony that samade is entering into a state of being in

295
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:41,280
harmony all things harmonious here and now so

296
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:48,920
um so uh pleasure so part of what we're doing in

297
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:57,319
going into samadi developing suat is becoming a uh an expert or a a

298
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:04,319
SE or a uh a uh of pleasure within us

299
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:12,200
and so we can find that onward leading pleasure which is not there because of the world in any particular way or a

300
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:19,720
fantasy of the world is any particular way but something that's deeply connected the wellwells up from within

301
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:25,520
and um and where we discover that just to be alive is

302
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:31,559
wonderful just to the rest in our beingness without needing anything else

303
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:36,960
to happen is um is

304
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:44,920
um is very very meaningful and significant so the samade of pleasure so

305
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,680
today you might go around maybe with a smile on your face or maybe with the

306
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:58,680
lightest Touch of beingness to see if you can when you feel feel that there's a

307
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:03,920
different kind of pleasure that's not there because the world is providing

308
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,800
pleasure uh and maybe it's it's the wholeheartedness in which you wash the

309
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:15,359
dishes maybe it's the full embodiment as you walk walking down the street that

310
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:22,240
you're really there for the walk from the inside out than uh studying the world around

311
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:28,119
you may this day be a day of Deep

312
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:35,160
pleasure varied pleasure so that you learn more about this

313
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:43,200
world and then um I wasn't going to say anything about our fundraising today but

314
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,720
last night I talked about I talked with someone who uh used to work for save the

315
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:55,640
children has many friends who still work there and um an IMC member who's kind of

316
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:01,839
been our connection there and uh she said that many of her friends many of the people around the world who

317
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:07,640
are doing the good work of save their children uh their positions were funded

318
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:15,599
by the agency of International Development and so they lost their jobs and so um I think that our fundraising

00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:22,319
drive to support save the children is even more important and meaningful now than it would have been even some weeks

320
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:28,520
ago and maybe it has even greater value to be able to support this wonderful

321
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:34,200
organization to continue their work at a time when the world really needs it so
