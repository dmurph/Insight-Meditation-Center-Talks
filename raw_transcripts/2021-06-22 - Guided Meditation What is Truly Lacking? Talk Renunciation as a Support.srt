1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,760
good evening good evening welcome welcome

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,280
hmm nice to be here

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,920
so we'll start with a guided meditation

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,560
as a way to support our practice and

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,279
to support our being here now

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:45,840
so taking our meditation posture

7
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,399
and having the body and a posture that expresses our intention to meditate and

8
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,799
also has some ease has a certain amount of

9
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840
relaxation

10
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,840
and then tuning into the body as it is at this moment

11
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,360
maybe in a global sense feeling tired or

12
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,119
restless agitated or calm

13
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,840
happy sad

14
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,920
maybe we're not sure

15
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,920
and then tuning in to some more particular experiences

16
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:22,400
the pressure against the body of whatever we're sitting on

17
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:30,480
on our lower legs our buttocks our back

18
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,840
perhaps our feet

19
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:51,840
we're here now

20
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:19,840
and then allowing the attention to land on the experience of breathing

21
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:33,840
feeling the movements of the body associated with breathing

22
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:47,120
the chest the abdomen

23
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,040
it's subtle but we might also notice a little bit in our back

24
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,840
or perhaps the feeling of air going in and out of the nose

25
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,959
in a relaxed easy way without straining

26
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,840
just noticing the sensations of breathing

27
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,960
and when the mind wanders of course the mind will wander

28
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:25,840
and when it does we just very simply gently begin again

29
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,680
and when the mind wanders we might notice

30
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:38,638
that sometimes there is a a wish for something more

31
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:50,960
sometimes might be planning what we're going to do or obtain

32
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,599
or we might be imagining how it would be so much better if only

33
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,840
dot dot

34
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:21,759
and when we find our mind lost and or pulled in this direction

35
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,800
we might just a little query ask ourselves

36
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,720
what in this moment is truly lacking

37
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,560
in the spirit of can we bring our attention back to this moment and

38
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,840
the fullness the completeness of this moment as opposed to focusing on what's absent

39
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:59,840
or what's not matching our preferences

40
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:13,840
at this moment is anything truly lacking

41
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,440
maybe you'll have to modify the question

42
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:41,839
in a way that resonates with you

43
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:09,839
does there have to be this sense of lack this sense of not enough

44
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,640
if it feels too complicated too burdensome

45
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,839
to be noticing when we're wishing things to be different or

46
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:06,240
planning what we're going to obtain or acquire or do next

47
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,880
and then responding with the question what's really lacking what's truly

48
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,920
lacking is anything lacking that's really

49
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,480
important

50
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:36,560
and if all of that feels too burdensome just being with the sensations of

51
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
breathing

52
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,440
we're approaching our meditation in this way

53
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:32,399
to help support a sense of it's okay in this moment

54
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,079
we don't have to have we don't absolutely have to have

55
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:48,560
these things that we're thinking about or planning or right now we're just here

56
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,839
meditating

57
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:08,399
sometimes we have a sense that we just need

58
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:17,840
more maybe we're not even clear more of what

59
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:30,960
but can we settle into this moment and let go of the idea that we

60
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,919
need to have more

61
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:44,960
and instead to notice the fullness the completeness of what's here

62
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,360
right now

63
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:59,840
so much harm gets created sometimes very subtle but harm

64
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:13,840
for ourselves for others by our always looking wanting more

65
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,880
when we put that down it not only supports us but supports others are not demanding

66
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,720
things from others and supports our communities our planet

67
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:40,640
if we can quiet abate the wanting more mind

68
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:49,039
so that in this way our practice can be a support not only for ourselves but for others

69
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:54,880
on the planet for everyone

70
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:09,840
so may all beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering

71
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,919
you

72
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:03,919
welcome welcome warm welcome wherever you are sometimes it's fun for

73
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:11,600
me to imagine there might be time in the future when somebody hears this even myself sometimes i want to remind

74
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,840
myself of what i've said and talk so sometimes i even listen to these things years in the

75
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,640
future whenever it is welcome

76
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:32,080
so all of us whether it's explicit or implicit whether it's obvious or we

77
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:41,360
stated out loud or whether it's just kind of in the back of our minds propelling us we all have some goals

78
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,799
some achievements maybe we could say or

79
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,518
some things we'd like to have in our lifetime

80
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,559
and in buddhist practice in early buddhism there's this idea that we can lose the

81
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,320
goal of awakening to be enlightened

82
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,320
and maybe in another talk i'll talk about uh some of the wisdom of that goal and

83
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,640
how to hold on to it and maybe how some of the other buddhist traditions approach it may be a little bit different

84
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:23,360
but putting that aside for now i'll assume that we all have this goal

85
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:32,879
whether it's implicit or explicit to have more freedom more peace more ease more well-being

86
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,919
the fact is that most of us come to this practice because we have a lot of

87
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:48,000
dukkha we have a lot of suffering we have something other than freedom other than peace other than ease

88
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,840
so we come here and do these practices with the intention of increasing

89
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,880
if not just abiding in wellness increasing the sense of okayness in our

90
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:06,960
lives and so we might ask well how can we

91
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,679
achieve this more freedom more peace more ease part of it of course is a meditation practice

92
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:20,799
but how can we achieve our goals and i heard a talk recently from james

93
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,799
clear it's a best-selling author where he stated

94
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:34,799
we don't rise to our goals we fall to our systems

95
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,120
we don't rise to our goals we fall to our systems

96
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:49,360
i don't know that kind of like struck me maybe i had a certain resonance that just because we have

97
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:57,120
goals doesn't mean that pulls us up and helps us to achieve them

98
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,039
we fall to our systems i haven't read this book by james clear so i'm just

99
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,960
basing all of this on these little snippets i've heard so i'm filling in all the details just

100
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:15,919
according to my interpretation but this idea that we fall to our systems

101
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:23,760
means in my mind that when we're under stress or what we do repeatedly over and over

102
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,440
that's what creates the conditions for the outcomes that we're going to

103
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,839
experience so that just because we might have a goal if we don't have the systems in

104
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:41,118
place that are consistent with that goal

105
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:47,280
then it's not so likely that we'll meet it maybe this is obvious and goes without

106
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,520
saying maybe i also say that something very much that i appreciate about buddhist

107
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,800
practice is that this goal of freedom and so much about the practice is

108
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,920
finding freedom and the way that we approach our experiences

109
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,280
and the way that we frame interpret our experiences

110
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:20,160
the things that we do things that we say so we might ask if james clear is saying

111
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:27,520
we don't rise to our goals we fall to our systems well what what are our systems

112
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:34,880
and i was thinking about this in terms of this buddhist practice oh maybe before i do

113
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:43,200
say that i'll say a little bit more about something that james clears says

114
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,880
he tells this story which was quite in i thought was quite remarkable and

115
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,040
i'll share it with you and perhaps you've heard this story elsewhere or already know about this

116
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,760
it tells the story of um the british cycling team and they had hired

117
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:08,240
a new performance director and i guess the british cycling team back in the

118
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,800
1990s and before hadn't done well and like in the tour de france for like over 100 years

119
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,079
they hadn't won it and didn't do very well in the olympics

120
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:28,000
and in fact um i think he says that some well-known uh psych bicycle

121
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,440
brand refused to sell bikes to the british team because they didn't want their brand of bicycle to be associated

122
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:42,480
with this team so okay i guess they're pretty bad so they hire this new performance director who says

123
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,839
okay we're just going to do one percent improvement we're just going to look for

124
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:54,640
a tiny small little improvement in lots of different places

125
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,680
so the way the story that james clear says is they did all the obvious ones you

126
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,720
know lighter tires and making sure that their

127
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,720
bikes are in tip-top shape i guess but included things like changing their

128
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,520
jerseys to some that are a little bit more lightweight a little bit more aerodynamic but then he said that they also made

129
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:25,839
these little one percent improvements in places that you wouldn't expect such as asking all the

130
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:33,200
athletes to try out a lot of different pillows and which pillow did they sleep

131
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,640
the best with and then they would take this particular pillow with them

132
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,800
when they had to travel to compete and then they hired some surgeon to come

133
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,400
in and to demonstrate the right way to wash your hands maybe all of us after coming through

134
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,680
this pandemic we know how to wash our hands um 20 seconds warm water but maybe you

135
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,200
know back then to really make sure they knew how to wash our hands to make it less likely that they would get a cold

136
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,200
or get a flu and i guess they have like these big giant trucks that carry all

137
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:14,960
the bicycles and they painted the inside of it white so that they could see

138
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,440
if there's any dirt and clean it all up so that the bikes would always remain clean and not have anything that

139
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,800
would jam up the gear so to speak so one percent these

140
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:34,720
little bit of changes in all these different areas and then the prediction was made

141
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:41,359
by this performance director that they should be able to win the tour de france in five years if they just consistently were making

142
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,480
these one percent changes

143
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,480
and i guess this turned out not to be true but in fact it only took three years to

144
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,000
win the tour de france and then i guess the british cycling team was just a force to be reckoned with

145
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,240
and did really well at the olympics so it wasn't only the tour de france it was the olympics the women's cycling team

146
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:13,119
the men's cycling team so i just think this is a powerful story

147
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:19,520
because i'm sure everybody who enters the tour de france i'm sure every single cycling team has the same

148
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:27,359
goal to win but what systems do they have

149
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:33,520
so i got to thinking about you know which systems do we have in our practice and buddhist practice

150
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:40,720
some of them are obvious but one i'd like to suggest are the pyramids

151
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:47,119
and the first i've been giving a talk a series on the

152
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,560
pyramids and the first is generosity just this movement of the

153
00:39:52,560 --> 00:40:00,160
heart and maybe the movement actually of the hands too but to not be stingy

154
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:06,079
but instead to share whether it's resources or time or giving people the benefit of the

155
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,760
doubt part of that's kind of a system we might have in our life it's this movement

156
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,960
towards generosity as opposed to kind of like grabbing and holding on

157
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:24,400
and stinginess the second part of me is ethics

158
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,640
that is to behave in a way that create creates the conditions for

159
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:37,280
more more well-being not only for ourselves but for others to follow these precepts that buddha

160
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,200
offered as a way to help support our practice help support our lives

161
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,720
and as i spoke about in the talk about ethics that we can use ethics not only as a

162
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:55,680
guideline for how we should behave but also as a way to as an indicator for ourselves

163
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:03,440
of when when are we tempted to or considering to not behave ethically

164
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:09,520
what is going on in our lives what's going on in our minds that makes us think that it's a good

165
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:18,160
idea to behave unethically and then the third one is

166
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:26,560
renunciation so this idea of renunciation is one of a

167
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:35,599
system that we have that is it's kind of the opposite movement of acquiring acquiring

168
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:41,040
acquiring or it's the opposite movement of following every single desire that we

169
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:49,440
have and and obtaining or satisfying every desire without any thought of

170
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,440
whether it's wholesome or worthwhile or helps bring us closer to our goals or is

171
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,359
in alignment with what's important for us

172
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:07,440
so the parmesa is one set of systems and i'm going to talk a little bit more about them but we could also think about just one

173
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,920
way is this idea of systems or habits what are some of the habits

174
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:21,760
that we have in our lives and james clear that he's a best-selling

175
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,520
author and the title of his book is atomic habits and i guess it's been a number one in

176
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:35,359
the on the new york times bestselling list for a while i don't know actually how long but

177
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,880
so what habits do we have we also have our beliefs

178
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:48,640
maybe you know that our belief that it's a scary place out there

179
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:54,079
or not i believe that people are intrinsically good or they're always

180
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,119
trying to trick us or you know some kind of our beliefs are also maybe some of our

181
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:04,318
systems our habits of thought our habits of interpretation

182
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:11,280
also our intentions we could think of as our system so we all know that right

183
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,119
intention is part of the eightfold path it's the second step

184
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:24,800
and right intention that is you know what is our what's underline our actions what

185
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,240
direction do we want to go and right intention highlights

186
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:38,839
that if we want to have some freedom achieve our goal of awakening liberation more ease more

187
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:47,839
peace to have the intention for non-allest non-greed

188
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:55,040
non-hatred and non-harming because this recognition that lust and hatred and harming

189
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:01,920
ourselves or others is not going to support our going where we want to go

190
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:08,800
so of course another way that we could say one of these intentions non-lust

191
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:17,440
non-greed is renunciation it's part of an intention and then just for completeness

192
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,440
i'll say that also good will and harmlessness or the other parts of our right

193
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,760
intention so maybe um i'll

194
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,520
share this quote to kind of like unpack a little bit what this means renunciation because

195
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:42,800
most of us we hear this word and uh it's not a warm fuzzy feeling it we have this feeling

196
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:50,319
maybe that it's um going to be about denial or uh um um

197
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:56,160
no like somehow uh the word now just slips my mind

198
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,079
so i'll just go to the next thing here is um asuta here's asuta reference and i'll

199
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,720
set it up that there's this monk who is often when he's meditating like off

200
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:16,839
in the woods or in an empty head by himself he's um saying to himself oh what

201
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:22,960
bliss oh what bliss so apparently he's really happy and he's

202
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,160
just saying out loud oh what bliss and the other monks

203
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:37,359
hear him saying this and the other monks are talking amongst themselves and and they say oh without a doubt

204
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:45,040
venerable buddhia badilla over here he must be dissatisfied with the

205
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:51,200
renunciant life being a monastic because it must be that when he's

206
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,319
remembering the pleasures of royalty he formerly enjoyed that he's

207
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:01,520
frequently saying uh what bliss o what bliss

208
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:08,240
so this monk used to be a king and now when he see now he's a

209
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:15,280
monastic and he's meditating and apparently he's really happy and everybody else is assuming maybe

210
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:22,079
because they're the suta doesn't say this i'm imagining that he's annoying them or disturbing them because

211
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:27,760
he's so happy and meditating he keeps on saying oh what bliss

212
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:34,240
so the monks go to the buddha let's say venerable buddhia over here is always

213
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:41,920
saying oh what bliss and the buddha says okay bring him to me

214
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:48,000
so venerable badiya comes to the buddha and the buddha says is it true that

215
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,680
you're saying oh what bliss all the time while you're meditating and he says

216
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,800
yes sir yes venerable sir and the buddha asks why

217
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:05,760
i was so here we go so here's what the buddha says is it really true buddhia that even in

218
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,880
the wilderness at the foot of a tree or in an empty dwelling

219
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:19,440
empty hut you frequently say oh what bliss yes sir but why do you say this

220
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:26,559
and here's his reason formerly as a layperson ruling the land my guard

221
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:32,640
was well organized within and without the royal compound within and without the city

222
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:39,920
and within and without the country so he describes how he was well guarded there at the palace

223
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,280
in the city and even in the whole country and he says but although i was guarded

224
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,720
and defended in this way i remained fearful and scared and suspicious

225
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:57,040
and nervous but these days even when alone in the wilderness at the

226
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,960
foot of a tree or in an empty dwelling i'm not fearful scared suspicious or

227
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,640
nervous i live relaxed unruffled

228
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:15,200
surviving on charity and my heart free as a wild deer

229
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:21,280
it is for this reason that even in the wilderness or at the foot of a tree or in an empty dwelling

230
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:29,520
i frequently express this heartfelt sentiment oh what bliss a weblist

231
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:39,680
so renunciation is pointing to this a king who has you know

232
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:46,319
everything presumably that he could imagine but still didn't feel quite safe partly

233
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:52,480
you know having so much is perhaps there's more to lose but this recognition of that kind of the

234
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,000
nervousness or the anxiety that's associated with

235
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,160
trying to protect so much so we might have a lot but then it

236
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:10,319
doesn't necessarily mean that we have more ease and we all know this there's a part of us that know that

237
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:17,040
even we get more and more and more it doesn't lead to more and more happiness

238
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:24,319
i've told this story before but it was really powerful this was years ago but had a big impact on me it

239
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:30,240
was when i had just finished graduate school and

240
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:37,040
just had to have like a a real job and one thing that i purchased

241
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,680
was a jacket that i really liked it was one of those that i just put on and i just felt good

242
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:49,440
in it it fit me well and i know i just really liked it

243
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:55,200
it was a little bit too expensive though but i purchased it anyways kind of maybe to

244
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,240
celebrate like now i have some income and i don't remember exactly why

245
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:06,720
how i justified it then so i had this jacket that i would like to wear but then

246
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,319
oh my gosh this jacket you know clearly i owned the jacket but it started to own

247
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:19,200
me oh okay i can't uh drink i sometimes would like drink i

248
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:26,000
have a drink in the car with me when i was driving like oh okay i can't do that anymore because what if i were to spill and get on my jacket

249
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,400
or if i'm at a restaurant a cafe coffee shop with somebody and i want to

250
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:38,240
take my jacket off it's too warm and i put it on the back of the chair oh then i get nervous everybody's walking by

251
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:45,200
they might i don't know spill something on it or something like this more and more this

252
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:52,800
just became so burdensome to own this jacket because i couldn't really afford another one and

253
00:50:52,800 --> 00:51:02,078
so you get my you get my sense here we all know this that there's

254
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:09,359
just acquiring more doesn't mean that things are going to be better

255
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:16,400
in fact simplicity right is often what kind of supports the

256
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:23,119
most ease and well-being there's a reason why we retreat centers residential retreat

257
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:28,800
centers the rooms are really simple

258
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:37,280
really simple small simple there's a reason why this schedule is very simple sit walk

259
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:44,559
have a meal do a yogi job sit walk sit walk

260
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:52,240
it's really simple and i would say for me this is one thing that i love about being on retreat is i love

261
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:59,040
just having this small little space just a few things and everything is so simple

262
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:05,838
it allows a sense of freedom a sense of

263
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,680
unburdened being unburdened so can we reframe when we think of this

264
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:19,040
word renunciation or relinquishment or

265
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:26,160
excuse me we can think of it as a system to support awakening to support more

266
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,839
freedom we can think of it also as maybe we

267
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:37,440
could reframe it as non-addiction

268
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:44,720
that is we often use this word addiction whether we have literal addictions which are

269
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:51,200
serious matters and really bring a lot of suffering to a lot of people

270
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:57,760
and then sometimes we kind of informally use this word addiction but these

271
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:04,480
really strong habits that we have attached to behaviors

272
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:10,400
or movements of the mind that don't really serve us

273
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:20,880
and yet we can't quite stop or we can't um disrupt the momentum of them

274
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:27,280
so if we think of this idea of renunciation as non-addiction maybe there's a way that

275
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,960
we can tease apart and take away some of the energy behind

276
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:39,440
some of this habits we might have that's not supporting us not helping us

277
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,480
not creating the conditions for more and more freedom

278
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,240
and the buddha when he highlighted in particular kind of our addiction to

279
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:56,160
sensual pleasures that is things that smell good and taste good and

280
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,920
sexual experiences things that feel good or sound good particularly music or things

281
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:10,800
like this and he was highlighting that our never-ending pursuit of one sensual pleasure after another

282
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,558
is not the way to the greatest freedom the greatest happiness

283
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:24,319
instead renunciation this way of being able to not follow these urges

284
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:31,599
these desires that we have and because it was in my view because it

285
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:37,440
was so difficult it's not something that's so easily done he spoke about in so many different ways

286
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:44,240
and different settings but for now i'd like to just maybe say a few

287
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:50,240
words about well what can we do with how might we work with this desire that we have for

288
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:56,960
sensual pleasure recognize it it's of course we have this it's

289
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:03,760
human to have this and we might even say we kind of evolutionarily inherited this

290
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:13,680
desire for sensual pleasures good tasting food good uh pleasurable physical experiences

291
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:23,119
and so one so it's definitely all of us humans have this and one way that

292
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:29,359
the buddha expressed this or pointed to this was the description of these

293
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:36,079
creatures called hungry ghosts perhaps you've heard of them that these creatures with these

294
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:42,400
really big empty stomachs really big stomachs and then these

295
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:49,920
really thread like mouths and necks so there was they could only get just a

296
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:55,200
little bit of food or sustenance in this thread thin

297
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,559
mouth and neck and this big belly would never be satisfied

298
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:06,640
so these hungry ghosts are perpetually always wanting more

299
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:13,040
in some ways the human experience is like this because and and we intellectually we understand

300
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:21,440
that there might be no way to satisfy this eternally hungry spirit so to speak

301
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:30,079
yet we persist we have this maybe this misguided striving to satisfy this never-ending

302
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:36,960
craving this force of desire is really powerful

303
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:43,440
it's really powerful so what are some things that we might do

304
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:53,119
one is just to notice how often this pursuit of sensual pleasure is leading us around

305
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:58,640
the what we acquire what we obtain what we buy

306
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:05,280
is it all about pleasurable experiences how we spend our time is it all about

307
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:11,040
trying to get that maximized comfort sometimes at all costs

308
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:17,920
to be sure there's nothing wrong with having sensual pleasure what i'm

309
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:24,240
pointing to is the never-ending it's not never-ending satisfaction it's never

310
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,760
satisfying it's never enough this never-ending craving

311
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:38,960
so is there a way that we can put that craving quiet it down subdue it

312
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:44,319
and be without it simplify things one is to notice

313
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:52,240
another is to maybe respond to some of these urges that we have in a skillful way

314
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:59,838
when we pay attention to them and to notice like oh yeah i really want that

315
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:06,480
maybe we could say no thank you in our mind no thank you so kind of

316
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:13,599
acknowledging that this urge has arisen but we're not going to follow it right now

317
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:20,960
so that could be another way that we might say to ourselves not now kind of highlighting that

318
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:28,559
there's not necessarily anything inherently bad with what we're desiring but maybe the

319
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:33,599
time isn't right for us to maybe we don't need to eat more food maybe we don't need

320
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:40,880
more clothes maybe we don't need that other gadget gizmo thingama thingamajig

321
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:50,000
or we could ask ourselves what in this moment is truly lacking

322
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,359
like what right now we might be planning in the future we need something but

323
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:59,519
right now what's truly lacking

324
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:08,880
or maybe we could say this is good enough it's good enough yeah maybe it would be

325
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:14,480
just a little bit better if i acquired and obtained and got more

326
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:21,520
but this is good enough so this is not easy it's not that we'll

327
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,720
do this you know five times and then our urges will go away

328
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:33,599
but if we do these small moments of disrupting this momentum of following

329
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:39,359
our desires repeatedly these small moments repeatedly

330
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:46,640
this will make a difference this is a system that we're creating of not always

331
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:52,319
succumbing to desires that it creates the possibility for so

332
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:58,480
much more to happen if we're not tangled up in following all of our

333
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:04,240
desires maybe just like the british cycling team we just you know it's just a tiny little

334
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:11,040
bit of improvement disrupt not following this desire and then not following that one we have so

335
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:17,040
many of them not in a sense that all desires are

336
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:23,040
banned but to be skillful in them and to be able to say sometimes

337
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:28,400
this is good enough no thank you

338
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:35,838
not now what in this moment is truly lacking

339
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:42,559
and in this way if we can subdue some of our desires and the buddha

340
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:49,040
pointed out that so much suffering is linked to our desires then this can create the conditions for

341
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:55,680
our goal for more freedom it can help create the system and

342
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,799
which they were not being pushed around so much

343
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:07,599
and the more freedom that we have the more our capacity grows to be with

344
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:13,200
difficulties and to help others to help ourselves to bring in the best version of ourselves

345
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:19,200
forward so in this way practicing renunciation

346
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:26,480
we could reframe it as non-addiction as not following the siren's call

347
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:32,400
every time can be this practice of renunciation can be for

348
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:39,838
our benefit and for the benefit of others thank you
