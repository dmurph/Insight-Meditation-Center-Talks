00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:11,280
hi everyone we taking a moment to notice

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,840
how it feels to be here whether you're engaged with the YouTube chat or just listening to my

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:31,480
voice and take a moment to welcome yourself say hello to your

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:38,040
being whatever state of mind or heart is present for you right

5
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:52,480
now noticing whatever is there beginning to turn

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:01,359
inwards [Music] noticing your posture

7
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:09,560
you're balanced over your hip points if you need to make any adjustments take that last sip of tea before settling

8
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,000
into

9
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,960
meditation and softening the eyes perhaps closing them

10
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:38,280
and inviting a couple of longer slower breaths

11
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,680
deeper and letting go on the

12
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:06,479
exhale letting go of any EX excess stress anything it took to get here this

13
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,239
morning letting yourself rest and relax

14
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,319
here alert

15
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,599
now and then allowing the breathing to return to normal

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,360
letting your belly be

17
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:53,280
soft your face your forehead the muscles to open and relax

18
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,959
there letting the eyes be soft the

19
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,879
tongue turning your gaze

20
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,560
inward friendly greeting to all that's there

21
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,980
noticing whatever's in your [Music] room Ambient

22
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:48,239
[Music] sound the contact of your skin against

23
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,120
cloth or

24
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,280
air the feeling of being weighted

25
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,760
rooted supported by the chair or cushion

26
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,120
whatever is Beneath

27
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:24,199
You supported by this time together the sense of connection

28
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,960
attuning to the sensations of aliveness inside this

29
00:04:50,199 --> 00:05:00,039
body the gentle motion of breathing at the belly or chest

30
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,120
maybe the broader field of sensations of

31
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,840
aliveness transpiration in the body

32
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:39,120
whatever [Music] form Vitality takes in this body

33
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,360
today and then

34
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,800
resting resting in

35
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,680
that I'll give brief instructions some mindfulness of

36
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:05,880
breathing but feel free to adapt adapt them to wherever your practice is

37
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:25,759
today allowing your attention to be

38
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:33,599
supported by the Rhythm the wave of the INB breath and the out

39
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:36,599
breath

40
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,479
noticing all the details staying in

41
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,560
contact with the full experience of breathing in the beginning

42
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:24,479
of the in breath the middle the fullness at the

43
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,039
top of the in breath

44
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:43,240
and then taking pleasure and the release of the

45
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,080
exhale relaxing

46
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,479
noticing that still point at the end of the

47
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:13,919
exhale and resting in it for a moment before the in breath naturally

48
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,919
emerges again

49
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:39,560
allowing yourself to be

50
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,719
nourished by this life's Breath by this

51
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,399
moment we'll practice in silence for a

52
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440

85
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:38,278
and in the last remaining moment of this

86
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,720
meditation consider turning the internal gaze back over this

87
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,000
period of practice

88
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,200
together with appreciation

89
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:09,880
whatever unfolded these moments of cultivating

90
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,039
connection with your

91
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,760
experience of building the capacity for

92
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,760
attention awareness being with a flow of the

93
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,159
present

94
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,360
moment and then turning that internal gaze

95
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:52,039
outward or it's the others in your life the others in this meditation

96
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:57,440
session as well included

97
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,360

98
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:17,080
well may they be happy safe from inner and outer

99
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:24,840
harm peaceful and

100
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:34,440
free and may our practice here together be a cause and

101
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,480
condition for greater love wisdom and Clarity in our

102

[Music]

106

Freedom thank you for your practice

107
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
e

108
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
e e

109
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:13,240
so dear sa here we are on Wednesday at least

110
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,080
those of us on this continent it's Wednesday

111
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:24,679
and offer a few Reflections on the theme of the week which

112
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:32,440
is cultivating qualities helpful for inner and interpersonal well-being but

113
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:39,600
especially focused on our our practice and our internal lives as I've mentioned sometimes the

114
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,279
Buddha would tell stories about difficult times and Society myths

115
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:52,760
often stories of the past and in each case he would recommend ways of making

116
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:59,639
the Dharma of making meditation practice our home our home land a place

117
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:06,600
of Peace no matter what's happening outside and in one of these teachings he

118
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,720
was talking to his most dedicated practitioners about ways that

119
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:18,600
practitioners can cultivate particular dhic kinds of flourishing including spiritual

120
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:24,240
empowerment or power inner beauty true

121
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,320
beauty happiness heart wealth and freedom and

122
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:35,039
yesterday we covered true beauty or virtue and today is

123
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,559
happiness so I'm happy to be teaching a little bit about dhic

124
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:46,159
happiness and I'll start out with a little personal anecdote this is from my

125
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:53,480
childhood as a little kid I loved two things horses and

126
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:59,600
reading active and not so active and I was a big reader I would

127
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,720
get completely totally immersed in books on these along road trips my family took

128
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:12,159
and are like old Buick station wagon the kind with the um wood grain on the side

129
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:19,840
and my parents would stop at some beautiful spot or um a rest stop a Vista

130
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,120
and they would get out of the car and be looking at this beautiful view and then they'd realize where's Dawn and they'd

131
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,799
have to go back and sort of like specifically jostle me awake so to speak

132
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:37,000
I was quite awake but I was completely immersed it was my happy

133
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,559
place and I say this because the kind of Happiness the Buddha talks about is a

134
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:49,120
form of complete absorption in the moment complete absorption in

135
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,639
meditation and that kind of absorption is available at one level or

136
00:32:55,639 --> 00:33:04,799
another to all of us this kind of collected mind this complete immersion in what is

137
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:11,000
happening so that was my first taste of a collected mind when I was I don't know six

138
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,200
whatever the Buddha describes this kind of Happiness of being absorbed in

139
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:22,240
meditation as being a skillful pleasure wholesome pleasure a pleasure not to be

140
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:29,159
feared but to be embraced and this this is the happiness

141
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:35,559
of samade collectedness a sense of being gathered

142
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:42,039
together unified what some people would call concentrated though I don't really like that

143
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:49,159
word aaga or aaga aaga is the poly word for Unity and

144
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:54,519
it's used both to describe harmonious group

145
00:33:54,519 --> 00:34:01,360
deliberation conversation cooperation and unifying in

146
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:07,440
meditation and this is not an accident there's no coincidence here I don't

147
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:16,638
think somehow integrating harmonizing with ourselves brings a kind of joy

148
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,560
interpersonally and personally that shared

149
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:30,520
present oh this doesn't mean huffing and puffing to get to a certain kind of

150
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:38,919
meditative state to get concentrated instead it's softening into the moment

151
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:46,320
softening into embracing being held by embodied

152
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,240
experience in fact the Buddha learned that the opposite being hard on himself

153
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,280
striving practicing austerities and self-denial didn't work so well

154
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:07,400
there's a story he tells from prior to his Awakening about practicing this kind of

155
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,560
self-denial austerity practice it was actually common in the time of the

156
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:20,480
Buddha and he had practiced denying himself so much being so assiduous so

157
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:27,000
dedicated that eventually he was on the brink of starvation and too weak to move and

158
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,440
ended up kind of lying in the grass by the side of the road and people mistook him for dead so they were just walking

159
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:41,800
on by but he was conscious barely and Along Came so The Story Goes

160
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:47,200
a woman suato going to the day's work in the

161
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,319
fields and she had with her some rice porridge or rice GRL not entirely

162
00:35:53,319 --> 00:36:00,520
certain exactly what it was but it some sort of liquid based on rice that was more more sustaining than just

163
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:07,040
milk and she saw him and she could tell that he was just barely alive and out of

164
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,240
kindness out of compassion she knelt beside him and she cradled his head in

165
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:18,319
her hands and fed him her own meal for the

166
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:25,400
day sip by Sip and eventually nourished he came to

167
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:32,000
just a little bit I imagine he sat up he thanked her somehow they parted ways and

168
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,640
so nourished the Buddha sat in meditation again that

169
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:45,440
day and perhaps it was the kindness The Compassion the connection perhaps it was

170
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,680
the food I suspect it was both but his meditation was

171
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,920
infused with this nourishment and that kind of positive

172
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:03,839
Association we sometimes have with feeling good in the moment after a good meal after sustaining

173
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:09,000
ourselves he had this memory from when he was a young

174
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,440
boy and in this memory he's sitting in the shade of a rose apple tree at his

175
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:24,640
parents estate and looking out over the fields and it's harvest time in the fields and he's comfortable and seeing

176
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:31,400
his father and the other people and the working these fields and he falls into

177
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:39,640
this very natural very present state of being absorbed completely

178
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:46,319
attuned with the moment content at

179
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:53,720
ease and as this memory arose a kind of wisdom voice came this

180
00:37:53,720 --> 00:38:00,800
is pleasure and this is a pleasure that's not to be feared not to be denied not to be pushed

181
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,160
away but instead to be cultivated that it's onward

182
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,680
leading and it was this moment the Buddha describes where he went away from the practices of

183
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:19,640
self-denial of striving too hard and into the middle

184
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:27,760
way a way of embracing meditative pleasure and contentment as an onward leading this

185
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:35,560
sort of a natural absorption and presence to be a a Hallmark a signal for

186
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,720
that things are going well in the practice right

187
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:47,560
now so allowing your practice to be infused with this kind

188
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:54,240
of kindness natural presentence

189
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:03,079
contentment easeful complet completely natural absorption is a form of meditative

190
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:10,200
happiness and is a form of onward leading meditative growth so I want to name here in a

191
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,920
technical sense absorption can refer to very specific kind of rarified

192
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:23,160
meditative States I've talked about that in the past on this program um you can look

193
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,319
back I believe it was last year this morning we're going to talk

194
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:34,760
more about the broader forms of Happiness addressed

195
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:40,599
available by meditation and Sade well short of any concentration

196
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:50,400
State this experience of beginning to gather together this coherence begins to invite joy happiness

197
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,200
ease contentment even early on in

198
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,560
practice trick is to notice moments of it notice

199
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:07,920
glimmers of it and appreciate it without grabbing onto it grabbing

200
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,760
onto it makes go away so that

201
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:22,240
noticing initially feeling good in meditation being absorbed in meditation

202
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,560
can start to feel like being carried Along on a stream

203
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,440
momentum and it can be helpful to notice or um sort of compare it to reference

204
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:40,079
points from other parts of your life so immersion wholehearted

205
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:47,319
engagement can happen when riding a horse jogging swimming playing an

206
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:54,480
instrument even programming on a computer it can even be available

207
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:01,200
sometimes short order Cooks if you look at a really skilled short order cook they're just totally in the

208
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:09,279
flow everything's happening and they're meeting it as it's happening nothing is extra no

209
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,800
distractions this creates a sense of the self sustaining momentum what chent

210
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,960
miali called flow and it's not so

211
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:27,480
different than momentum in meditation practice

212
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:33,800
and it can take a little while to get there for example in riding a horse which I did as a kid and a

213
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:42,760
teenager there could be a lot of kind of bouncy effort initially and it can take real

214
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:50,599
mindfulness to begin to connect and find a rhythm but then when the Rhythm emerges

215
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:59,079
there's this effortlessness this unification of Horse and Rider

216
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:05,680
the Buddha likened skill and samama to a mind like a well-trained Thor

217
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:15,160
bread and as this happens even glimpses of it tiny glimpses bring up

218
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:21,440
Joy this Rhythm can show up as an ease with connecting to attention and then

219
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,800
sustaining it putting your hand on a cat and stroking it as an example Gill

220
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,839
sometimes uses that sustaining staying with the

221
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:39,720
moment is stroking the cat and as this happens the mind and

222
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:46,760
body can begin to purr it can bring along Happiness joy kind of a thrill

223
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:53,440
even a simple kind of joy of being present at times the heart lighting up

224
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,480
with confidence or appreciation

225
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:05,160
it can also feel like the glow after a good laugh or soften into

226
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:13,119
contentment like dipping into perfectly temperatured water on a warm

227
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:21,520
day this softens down even to Serenity a sense that just to be alive is

228
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:29,400
enough just to be alive is enough so to say that experiences of

229
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:35,200
meditative happiness joy flow are available to each of us in different

230
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,680
ways it can be as individual as your fingerprint so there's no need to look

231
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:50,240
for it like something you've read or heard about just trust trust glimpses of

232
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:57,920
contentment ease joy happiness whenever it arises

233
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:04,480
in meditation and in life it's onward leading and it's nourishing to a

234
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,720
practice so thank you all very much for listening to my little wrap about

235
