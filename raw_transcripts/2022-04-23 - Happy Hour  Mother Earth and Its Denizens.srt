polluted rich with smoke was hard to breathe

90
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,639
not to take clear clean breath air

91
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,839
for granted

92
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,480

four-legged whether they have wings

109
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,839

110
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,959

117
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,880
how vulnerable

118
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:20,000
how complex how beautiful can we take on that vision we've all

119
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,319
seen images

120
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,440

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:36,799
as a mysterious magnificent entity

173
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,919
can we have love can we love

174
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,840
mother earth

175
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,000
not in an extractive way but

176
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,200
a way of loving devoting caring

177
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,278
the way we would care for children

178
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,240
for tender leaves for tender beings

179
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,240
loving nature

180
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,880
our mother earth along with all the beings

181
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,880
all the ecosystems and the beings who live in the ecosystems

182
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,000
the ice worms that live in the tundra who knew

183
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:41,520
such richness magnificence opening our hearts with awe

184
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,039
with love can we care

185
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:54,240
how can we serve how can we protect what we love

186
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:02,760
what we value feel devoted to

187
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,200
not thinking right now about what letters you can write no not later

188
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:18,399
later but right now just tapping into a space of the heart

189
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:26,720
it's not a space of thinking [Music] it's not a space of thinking

190
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:34,799
the space of the heart let it be tender it's not a space of planning

191
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:42,240
not now with each breath just connecting to

192
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:50,559
nature right here right now this breath this body too is nature

193
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,240
it's connected to the earth

194
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,240
it is earth it is nature

195
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,880
and again if at any point sadness arises

196
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:34,000
with respect to nature mother earth

197
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:42,240
can we meet it can we meet it with compassion holding the sorrow

198
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,640
the frustration which is ours

199
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,760
can we hold it with care the way we would hold

200
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:07,360
a crying baby a lot of patience

201
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,960
they're there here here i'm here for you i'm patient resilient

202
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,960
loving

203
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,840
and here as long as it as i'm needed

204
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,360
knowing that our time on this earth is limited this being who is me

205
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,840
we're born and we will die

206
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:24,158
how can we care how can we leave this earth

207
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:33,600
better a better place a safer place a more nourishing place

208
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,840
for others

209
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,120
and again not to start thinking and planning but drop this question into your body

210
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:04,000
as if a quant drop this question into your body as a koan

211
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,399
as an aspiration

212
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,840
for the last moments of this practice period

213
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:48,399
holding yourself holding yourself with compassion with care

214
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,600
this earthly warm that each of us is

215
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,559
for whatever rose or did not arise during this practice

216
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:13,280
maybe your mind was completely distracted there was not a moment's peace

217
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,200
it's okay can you be kind to yourself let go

218
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,919
you've tried you showed up you did your best

219
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:31,200
can you have groundedness and meta love acceptance openness

220
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,398
in this second forget about the last 30 minutes

221
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:44,078
can you have it in this moment just this moment to accept yourself

222
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,000
just as you are

223
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,960
and to extend this kindness to all beings

224
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:10,869

[Music]

232
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,400
thanks everyone thank you for your practice

233
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:28,320
so [Music] birthday appreciating the earth and its

234
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,440
denizens so i'm going to change the setting so that

235
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,040
you can type in chat either to me or to the group

236
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:46,480
and if you type it to everyone i'll read your name your reflection and if you just type it to me it'll be private

237
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:54,560
and bill i see your hands up please uh hi nikki

238
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,320
when you uh stated what the meditation is going to be about um

239
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:07,200
i i felt a lot of aversion uh in the form of anger and but underneath that fear because

240
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,799
this is an anxiety producing subject for me

241
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,640
i tried to stay with it but it was just it was hard for me to stay on track you

242
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:25,760
know but i can see the value of it i mean maybe more so because i i don't want to

243
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,520
do it that made maybe that's a little more reason to do it um

244
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,680
i'm not sure where i'm going with this i don't think i have a question just i was just expressing myself so thank you

245
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:44,400
thank you bill hold on don't mute yourself just yet um yeah thank you so much for for sharing

246
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,560
expressing um that a lot of anger and underneath that

247
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:57,520
fear and it's great that you have the clarity to know that and and ah just this pain of i don't want to

248
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:03,359
do this i don't want to do this and yet realizing actually because that's a sign that maybe i need to stay

249
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:09,760
with this maybe there's something here to open my heart to the pain because there's a lot of pain

250
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,560
so there's a lot of pain um and a lot of times when something is painful

251
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:23,359
or traumatic we are afraid or scared or angry when we push it away we

252
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,880
don't even turn to it and when there's even news on the radio about earth is like we just turn it off like i can't go

253
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,800
there it's just too hard it's just too painful right and we can't even do anything about it because we're just

254
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:42,640
blocking it off it's like not there just like it's just whereas by slowly slowly

255
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:49,440
actually attending to your own suffering to your own pain like this this is hard this is painful

256
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,839
and increasing your capacity to care but have equanimity by being

257
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:03,359
overwhelmed you're not helping anyone you're not helping yourself you're not helping the the causes you can support

258
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,800
um the awareness you can have so so i'm

259
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:16,560
i'm appreciating the um the wisdom of knowing that oh yeah actually i feel like i need to hang it

260
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,560
hang out here longer even it may be hard and bill you've been

261
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:30,240
doing this long enough my friend that i think you you can you are ready to gently gently

262
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,839
explore this territory with compassion yeah thank you

263
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,599
thank you thank you so much

264
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,640
other reflections

265
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,079
i see um see a couple of private messages can you complete the

266
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:00,000
mantra but i cannot solve your problems for you oh oh it's

267
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,640
it's not a mantra first of all it's the it's a compassion phrase so there are a lot of compassion

268
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:14,240
phrases like tonight i didn't offer any formal ones but so the compassion phrases i care for

269
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,599
you i care for you but i can't so solve your problems for you i can't make them go

270
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,800
away another reflection recently i too find myself avoiding experiences certain

271
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:31,359
radio shows podcast calls people because i fear adding to my sadness grief or anxiety i wonder if you can comment on

272
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,960
how to counter this tendency which limits one yeah yeah it's the

273
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:44,160
of practices i think what what supports the the balancing of that is the practice of equanimity so first is the

274
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:50,240
practice of compassion so and and again we don't go for the hundred pound weight we don't go for the

275
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:56,319
hundred pound weight you start with the 10 pound weight okay what's what's easy maybe in your practice maybe in your

276
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:01,599
daily practice you just bring a little bit of something that brings you sadness

277
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,960
about the earth or something else um and and

278
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,240
hold it with care with love again with this being with this vision of holding

279
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,760
your child that hurting which is you your own emotions with love with care

280
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,119
it's okay it's okay patience patience and through that

281
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:30,880
through that patience it can open up to equanimity because you can be here there's a sense of stability a sense of

282
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,880
equipoise that is built through the practice of

283
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,760
the through the practice of compassion

284
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,760
is that clear the person who asked a question you can send me a private chat

285
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,520
if you want i see a long chat that was sent to me while i was giving the

286
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,760
guided meditation which i don't read usually it can be very disturbing it distracts me so i'll look at this later

287
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,839
thank you um

288
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:12,079
so any other reflections you can raise your hand

289
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,680
okay and the person says yes clear and appreciate the answer you're welcome

290
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,960
thank you for your practice

291
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:29,520
yeah and pat on youtube asked practice equanimity first yes don't go in and

292
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:37,040
prepare it could be either way path we could start with compassion because that's where pain is we can start with

293
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:44,720
compassion and build and go towards equanimity or we can start with equanimity and then

294
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,200
build towards compassion it can work either way

295
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,920
yeah ram please and if you could also turn on

296
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,040
your camera that'd be lovely so we can actually see you

297
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:11,280
just give me a second so my question was when i used to practice meta

298
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:18,240
for when i used to think of beings that were close to me or let's say i i was able to feel that love

299
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,880
and kindness but today when i was thinking about now earth as a being i was not able to

300
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,559
resonate that feeling even though i am deeply deeply

301
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:36,640
interested in conservation and all these topics so i was

302
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,800
i was just thinking where did i you know go wrong yeah yeah you haven't gone wrong there's

303
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:50,480
there's not a problem so i'm so appreciative that you brought up this question so so sometimes when we practice meta we

304
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,480
have a feeling since there's a feeling of warmth and care connection right

305
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,560
and sometimes we don't have that feeling and it's okay don't think that you've

306
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:09,280
done it wrong trust that you're still planting seeds you're still planting seeds that might

307
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:15,520
flower later so later today or tomorrow the next day all of a sudden there might be a sense of tenderness you might be

308
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,760
walking and see trees go oh mother earth oh wow this earth like it might flower

309
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,800
then so it's okay don't expect results for your timetable like wait i didn't

310
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:34,960
feel the warmth i didn't feel the connection where is it patience patience patience and trust is

311
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,720
trust your planting seeds yes okay great great thank you so much

312
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:48,800
thank you okay all right dear friend so so um at this time we um

313
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,880
in at happy hour we turn to um small groups and it's just for six seven

314
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,000
minutes and it's where we meet other practitioners we meet other

315
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,040
practitioners in this space and please listen carefully to the instructions this is a very formalized

316
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:14,319
way of practicing it's not just oh go and talk amongst yourself it's not that

317
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:20,480
it'll be a group of size 3 roughly and each person is invited to share one

318
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,599
nugget if you have five or six nuggets just share one just share one

319
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:32,560
the next person will share one nugget or they can say pass and they can just hold kind loving

320
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,839
patient space for others you can do that too and then the next person says

321
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:43,520
something or they say pass and it comes to you again so you go round and round

322
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,720
in a spiral a few times it's not a long monologue it's just a

323
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:55,599
