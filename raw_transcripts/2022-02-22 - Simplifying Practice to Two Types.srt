1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,720
so welcome welcome welcome everybody

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:16,279
such a great thing to be able to practice together so thank you

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,800
to come and be here

4
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,519
so i recently just finished teaching a loving kindness retreat and

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,440
it was quite something it was very tender as you might imagine

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,360
but a number of people at the end commented that

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,480
they don't usually necessarily do loving kindness and i thought well they'd do this retreat to kind of maybe

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,120
get their practice going and at the end of the retreat they were wondering wow

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,280
why didn't i do this earlier why didn't i do this you know earlier in my practice because even

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,199
though i've been doing all these wisdom and insight and mindfulness

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,720
just noticing that having a container of warmth

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,759
somebody described it as kind of having this golden sheen to everything all the

13
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,560
practices makes a difference makes a real difference

14
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:33,119
and so i was reflecting a little bit about this idea of you know what is practice how do we think about practice

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,360
and so tonight i'd like to talk a little bit about one way not the only way

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:49,200
one way we can think about practice in kind of a simplified generalized way

17
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,360
and to be sure that there are i'm i'm like moving towards simplification in this talk and

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:05,119
to be sure there's ways in which we could really get into the weeds and make it you know complicated maybe if

19
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,479
that's opposite is simple and sometimes i like to do this but

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:19,440
but sometimes it's helpful just to be reminded oh yeah there's a big forest here not just the trees

21
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,040
so why is it helpful to sometimes think about simplifying practice is

22
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,400
if we find ourselves feeling a little bit stuck like

23
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,599
i don't know like a dryness a i'm not sure where this is going i'm not feeling

24
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,800
inspired i'm doing it because i feel like i ought to or this is what i have been doing or

25
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,519
something but if we feel maybe a little bit of stuckness or dryness

26
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:58,080
maybe that's perfectly fine and that's just a part of the season of practice

27
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,360
but also maybe there's a way in which we can look at it in this kind of simplified way and might see if there's

28
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,400
a way in which we might look at things a little bit differently that can provide a support for practice

29
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,400
so i'm using this word practice what do i what do i mean by that

30
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:28,319
i would say the way that i'm defining buddhist practice as this general something that supports the movement

31
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,040
towards greater understanding either of ourselves or of others or

32
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,159
how the world works or doesn't work as the case may be

33
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:47,840
or this general movement towards greater ease or peace or happiness

34
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,629
or a greater [Music]

35
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,680
diminishment maybe of suffering so this elimination of suffering letting suffering go so this movement towards

36
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,959
understanding ease and less suffering in some kind of broad brush

37
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,759
so this real simplified way is to think about there are two types of practices

38
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,880
one is cultivation practices in which we're creating

39
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,759
maybe not creating as much as building or developing or supporting something

40
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,440
to become a little more steady or reliable or

41
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,840
stronger cultivation practices and then on this side

42
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,520
simplified way we think about letting go practices shedding

43
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,600
releasing renouncing letting go so on one side we're kind of like

44
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,120
building up making stronger maybe a bigger we might use those kind of language

45
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,160
and the other side we're letting go kind of shedding and this is kind of

46
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,479
a different type of movement and to be sure we need both types of

47
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,520
practices kind of this cultivation and this letting go and

48
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,240
one way we might understand it is in um suzuki roshi's very famous saying i don't know how many

49
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,240
times i've heard this many perhaps you guys have as well here's this quote

50
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,560
each of you is perfect the way you are and

51
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,479
you could use a little improvement kind of this we might think of it as a

52
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:48,479
paradox but in one way that we might understand it too is each of you is perfect it's the way that you are

53
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,560
this may be an invitation to let go of anything that makes you think otherwise

54
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:01,120
and you could use some improvement is to cultivate those qualities or those properties

55
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:09,120
properties doesn't sound quite right but those qualities mind states experiences that can really be a support

56
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,560
so this recognition that this inter-relationship or the

57
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,479
dependence on both types of these practices but it's not uncommon for people to have a

58
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,840
preference for one type or the other

59
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,080
and sometimes it has to do with an aversion towards one type or the other

60
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,800
for example this whole idea of cultivating building [Music] developing

61
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,319
might feel like exhausting like i'm already exhausted from my life the last

62
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,720
thing i want to hear about is something that needs to be done more something to the addition of it's the

63
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,080
last thing i want no thank you i just want to sit quietly

64
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:04,319
or there could be this sense that they find it feels a little bit offensive even to imagine that

65
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,400
something needs to be different i'm perfect the way that i am and i just the whole rest of the world needs to start

66
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,960
behaving itself how dare you kind of suggest that i need to cultivate something

67
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,800
so those people tend to prefer kind of this idea of letting go and they might use language like letting

68
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,039
be but there's also kind of this sense of well i don't want to do letting go pros

69
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,639
uh practices because i'm just barely hanging on

70
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,080
and i'm it has everything i it takes everything i got just to hang on

71
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,520
and you're suggesting i let go but i that's not it's not even

72
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,400
that's exactly what i don't want to do or there might be this idea that

73
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,759
everything seems so slippery so this whole idea of letting go but they're

74
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,879
feeling like i can't even hold on to anything what do you mean let go nothing is

75
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,000
everything is sliding away there's nothing that i can hold on to

76
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,720
and different people different seasons of their practice different times of their practice might kind of have a

77
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:23,360
preference or one in which they find a little bit more ease or comfort or that just naturally arises

78
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,280
so this recognition that both are needed and there may be times in which we

79
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:36,080
are going more one direction than another and also i'm making this distinction between

80
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,760
cultivation and letting go but let's be honest it's maybe entirely

81
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:49,839
artificial to make this distinction also because in some ways they are the same

82
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:57,040
the obvious ways we could look at the practice of generosity we think of it as a cultivation practice

83
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,920
but generosity itself is a letting go so we're cultivating and letting go at the same time that's

84
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:11,120
an obvious example when there are indistinguishable these two qualities

85
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,880
but there's another way in which we could even say with mindfulness practice

86
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,480
we cultivate mindfulness being here in the present moment and with the experience but

87
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:30,880
at the same time in order to do that we're letting go of all the ways in which we intentionally distract ourselves

88
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,880
so this idea of cultivation and letting go and separating them you know sometimes

89
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,480
he's useful and sometimes isn't

90
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:52,399
but this to say a little bit more about what does it mean this idea of cultivation practices that

91
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,760
there are many parallels between cultivating the mind cultivating the

92
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,519
heart and cultivating a garden

93
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,839
one thing is of course that we just don't think about

94
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,279
seeds being planted and watered we actually do it

95
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,720
right so it's not only about believing or thinking or wishing or something about

96
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,240
that but it's a it's an activity a certain type of activity

97
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,760
and cultivation practices are very much like planting seeds

98
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,839
we plant them and

99
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,360
we give them what they need without explicitly

100
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:50,160
making them grow right seeds have the potential to grow inside them

101
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,240
we're not giving them that potential it's already there and we're just creating the content the

102
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,480
conditions in which that potential can be actualized

103
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,120
in the case of plants sun soil nutrients water

104
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,720
in the case of our practice attention

105
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,720
intention and

106
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,959
a willingness to allow things to unfold in the way that they're going to unfold

107
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,000
instead of insisting that they be a particular way

108
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,399
so this recognition that we're just taking care of the conditions

109
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,440
rather than the specific making them grow

110
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,079
and i think all of us recognize that depending on what we value we will

111
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,279
cultivate different things because no matter what we do we're

112
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,480
cultivating something with this idea of neuroplasticity

113
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,360
so if we have this habit of

114
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:16,399
getting filled with outrage when we hear or see or read the news or

115
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,000
something like this right then it just the more time we spend in outrage

116
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,160
the easier it becomes to become outraged

117
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,360
i'm not saying that these um emotions or ideas

118
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:40,160
aren't appropriate but i think we all know this that whatever the mind frequently ponders upon that

119
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,720
becomes the inclination so not only the mind but the heart and the emotions

120
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,440
and so of course the buddha encouraged us to cultivate those things that are going to be

121
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,040
helpful that are going to lead us towards this happiness and greater understanding and

122
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,519
less suffering and chances are that you don't need me

123
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,839
to tell you this idea that the buddha encouraged us to cultivate

124
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:18,320
ethical actions to behave in the world in a way in which we don't cause harm

125
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,399
neither to ourselves nor to others and sometimes that's not so easy

126
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,959
so it requires us to see if there might be some creative way in which we can work with something in

127
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:38,480
which there really isn't harm being caused also requires us to be sensitive

128
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:46,040
to maybe some of the subtle ways in which harm gets caused with our words with our language

129
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,639
and the buddha also talked about maybe before i leave this idea of um

130
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:06,399
causing harm not causing harm i'll add to this also to become sensitive to the ways in which the ways the inner critic

131
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:12,880
sometimes rises up and causes harm for you know the way that sometimes we

132
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,720
talk to ourselves or some of the language or you know berate

133
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,240
ourselves turns out not to be so helpful

134
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,040
and harmful

135
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,920
the buddha of course also called encouraged us to cultivate a steady mind

136
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:45,160
so that we can see more clearly so that we can see what's happening and see the consequences of our actions

137
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,560
just allowing the mind and the body to settle

138
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:00,320
these days it seems so often that there's these um prompts to get a little bit agitated in

139
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,160
some kind of way i'm using this word agitated really broadly but

140
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:13,519
it seems like um we've created a world in which we're often like poked if you know notified and or you know somehow

141
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,519
there's this way in which we get uh

142
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,720
i'm using this word poked sometimes it feels like that

143
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,320
maybe you have a better word but um you know there's you know the media of

144
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,000
course wants to promote this way of outrage too right so

145
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,399
this idea of to cultivate a steady mind in the face of this recognition right

146
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:49,680
that there are industries out there who are created specifically to keep us agitated in some kind of way

147
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,160
the business models of there's these aren't bad individuals it's just this

148
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:04,079
recognition that what they are promoting isn't necessarily for our long-term welfare and happiness

149
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,320
to sensationalize or to notify or

150
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,040
incessantly

151
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:24,959
the buddha encouraged us also to cultivate a warm heart so a steady mind and a warm heart

152
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,720
so with brahmavahara practice loving kindness practice and it's the beautiful part about this

153
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,839
it's not only to cultivate a sense of warm-heartedness

154
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,000
but also to have this movement towards the boundlessness of this

155
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,759
warm-heartedness so that it's not just for those we know and care about those who

156
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,959
are we feel the most comfortable with or are most familiar but

157
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,160
to cultivate this way of this boundlessness for all beings everywhere

158
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,798
and this does take cultivation it's not something that humans naturally do

159
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,720
and this idea to also with a loving kindness and

160
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:20,480
all the brahma-gaharas compassion sympathetic joy equanimity also this unconditionality

161
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,558
is there a way that we can express this

162
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,679
without having any sense of whether people were or deserve it or not

163
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,760
taking that out of the equation just saying no this is this is what this heart does this heart loves

164
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,799
this heart cares this heart has warmth independent of

165
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,160
oh the specifics the particulars of the individuals

166
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,480
and then of course you know the buddha has all these lists seven factors of awakening 10 permis

167
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:05,039
like there's like seems like there's no end to the things that we can be developing and cultivating and

168
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:14,400
but we can get out of balance if we emphasize this cultivating part

169
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,440
and i know this has happened to me in my practice like unknowingly

170
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,799
i felt like okay buddhist practice kind of supported this self-improvement project that i wasn't

171
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:32,720
even quite so aware of and so yeah i gotta cultivate this and

172
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,320
this and this and all these handy lists that i never could quite check off right we can

173
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,080
easily fall into that kind of a mind state or

174
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:52,559
understanding of practice and to be sure there are plenty of zuta passages and

175
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,320
teachings that are about the importance of effort and diligence

176
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,840
but it might be a way in which we just take that on it's like yes i'm never

177
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,400
going to be finished this is a huge project i have to keep on working

178
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:17,760
and let's be frank we are a pragmatic and goal-oriented culture

179
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:26,320
that we like to put effort into our jobs our relationships our vacations

180
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,720
recently i've learned this expression you know to have relationship goals you know like so there's all these

181
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:39,120
ways things you know that we're supposed to achieve in like all areas of our lives

182
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,120
which is great there's nothing wrong with that with having a vision of what's possible and a orientation of a

183
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,039
direction we want to go but outside of kind of the buddhist

184
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:58,880
practice and outside of the meditation circle there can be a sense of well just try harder if you

185
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:06,000
haven't reached all these goals or haven't accomplished all these things that we

186
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,760
might have these expectations about

187
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:19,120
try harder just try harder oh ouch right this is exhausting

188
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,480
it seems like there's no end so there's all this cultivation and that is

189
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,679
a part of practice but we can get out of balance

190
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,240
and we might think that we just have to try harder and strive and strain

191
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:44,159
but then we end up kind of like tight and i've got this with my body because it's kind of how it feels

192
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:51,919
and then everything feels you know has this flavor of inadequate and not enough and

193
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,639
need more

194
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,559
so instead we might have i need more effort

195
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:10,240
i need to put more energy in i have to try harder without looking at it well maybe there's

196
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:18,559
a different type of effort a different type of activity

197
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:26,320
and that is the letting go kind of the releasing as opposed to acquiring and building

198
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,639
instead this movement of letting it go

199
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,799
so there might be some if we call letting go like relinquishment or giving up or something

200
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,799
like that that sounds uh a bit uncomfortable it can sound like a renunciation or

201
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,480
surrender which can sound like deprivation like that's not the direction people want to

202
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:57,360
go they don't want to feel deprived of course and that's not the direction we're going

203
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,480
we're not going towards any way that has this personal

204
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,799
diminishment or in a way that suggests any type of weakness

205
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:15,679
that we just have to let go because we're not able to hold on or something like that

206
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,840
no it's something different it's about a more like a shedding

207
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,120
just in the way that snakes shed their skin when they grow

208
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,640
and during the different seasons the animals shed fur and birds

209
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,280
molt feathers just like oh it's just a natural thing to be letting go it's kind of like this

210
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:45,919
natural process and sure we can see that maybe animals are

211
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:52,320
scratching a little bit when they're that fur is uh shedding and the birds or when they're

212
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,679
molting sometimes are preening a lot so there can be a little bit of

213
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:04,080
uncomfortableness but still this recognition like oh yeah this is the direction we're going

214
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:12,159
and something that i like is this story that's uh in the vineya about ananda

215
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:18,480
the buddha's attendant and after the buddha died

216
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:25,120
they got together they being the senior members of the buddhist

217
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:31,200
followers all the fully awakened senior members

218
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,880
to recite the teachings to get together like okay what did the buddha say we

219
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,640
have to preserve these pass it on to different generations and ananda of course

220
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,799
was the one that had memorized them all because he was the attendant of the buddha

221
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:56,080
but he wasn't awakened completely and this

222
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,520
was only for awakened people so what was he going to do so

223
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:08,400
the evening before this big grand meeting he's huffing and puffing and striving

224
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,559
and straining to get a weekend and all of us have tried to huff and

225
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:22,480
puff and strive and strain too i think right this is just part of the way we tend to approach practice but

226
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,640
so he meditated strenuously and and just

227
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:35,520
nothing happened so i gave up

228
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,279
i went to bed sat down on this vet

229
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:53,120
this is how the story goes and lifted his feet up to put it in bed

230
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:59,200
and before his head had hit the pillow this big release

231
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,799
when he became awakened so it was when he had kind of relaxed

232
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,840
given up this idea that things have to be a particular way

233
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,880
it was maybe straining and striving and said okay i just can't do it and let go

234
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:25,760
and it became a weekend and i hear about this a lot on retreats

235
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,840
and myself i've had this experience too that sometimes during a retreat you know sit walk sit

236
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:38,559
walk you know for days and days of sitting and walking and people can get really tight and

237
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,840
be trying so hard and sometimes retreats are really hard

238
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,400
there's maybe something about there's the transition of you know finally the bell rings at the end of the set like

239
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,080
oh my gosh okay i made it and then they go to stand up and just in

240
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,480
that moment of kind of relaxing with the standing up there may be something that oh a new

241
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:11,039
understanding that happens so this recognition of letting go

242
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:18,240
is just a natural thing that happens and sometimes it happens just during the

243
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:25,279
transitions we're not making it happen it's just a

244
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:32,799
an unguarded moment allows the mind and the heart to open in some kind of way

245
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:40,320
and to be sure we let go all the time in daily life we change plans the weather is now

246
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:46,799
raining we're not gonna have a picnic or through our life our preferences have

247
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:53,039
changed i used to hate ketchup when i was a kid ketchup is fine now

248
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,799
i'm sure all of us have this idea right of things that we didn't used to like and we have different priorities

249
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,559
and in our older life that we didn't have when we were young so it's just this

250
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:10,880
natural thing of just letting go and to be sure learning to let go is a

251
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,120
skill for a happy healthy life

252
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,080
and so as part of buddhist practice letting go is

253
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,360
not only of what makes us tight i can't help but i do this with my body

254
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,799
when i'm describing it because this is how it feels but there's a way in which um there's

255
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,840
not only letting go but also the compulsion

256
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:47,120
to want to grab on in the first place when we notice we're have grabbed on we

257
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,360
can open our fist but there's just this movement of wanting to grab on that gets let go too

258
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,919
that gets softened and diminished as we practice

259
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:04,080
this sense of this enduring self that's at the center of

260
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,440
everything and that has to be bolstered and protected and

261
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:16,399
highlighted and let go that let it be softened like

262
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,840
oh yeah sometimes there's this in sense of self but other times i'm busy with

263
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,120
other things and there isn't a sense of self and this recognition that it arises it gets

264
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,879
constituted and then it goes and does something else

265
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:39,520
so letting go of the sense of an enduring sense of self

266
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,440
letting go of ideas being permanent anything being permanent

267
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,640
and letting go of the idea that when things are uncomfortable that

268
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,360
somehow it's a terrible mistake and there's got to be an error somewhere and

269
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:05,360
who's to blame for this suffering is part of life

270
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,840
and i think though unfortunately there's only one way to really learn that is that is to have suffering

271
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:24,640
so what if we kind of reworded or re-languaged this idea of letting go

272
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:32,000
i think i i'm not exactly sure where i heard this first it might have been from gil but this idea that instead of

273
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,720
letting go is this idea of giving up as in like towards the ceiling

274
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,720
because i guess the origin of this idea of giving up is like to put up on the

275
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,840
altar so to make a a

276
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:59,440
an offering in this way it's an act of generosity

277
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,799
or we might think of it that somehow maybe it's a sacred act this it's a

278
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,840
movement of the heart this idea of giving up

279
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:18,480
and then some ways then it feels like oh okay so it's in the service of what's wholesome and

280
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,880
what's virtuous and help support this beneficial states of

281
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:32,240
mind and is in the service of creating this

282
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:38,559
spiritual wealth this inner treasure inside of us

283
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:46,640
inside of all of us so this letting go this giving up

284
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,240
is for one way in which we help create the conditions

285
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,760
for the seeds that we've planted with the cultivating practices to sprout

286
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,080
and to blossom

287
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,639
so we can let go into something beneficial something

288
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,840
supportive wholesome

289
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:24,559
so with deepening meditation practice and we have this greater range of what is wholesome and beautiful and

290
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:30,159
meaningful these inner states that we

291
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,278
discover explore become more familiar with

292
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,480
let me just start to recognize oh yeah a little bit of letting go here allows

293
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:47,279
me to tap into tune into that particular state be sensitive to

294
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:54,159
that state and letting go or giving up

295
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,440
just becomes more and more something that the mind and the body and the heart just

296
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,840
want to do

297
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:12,399
so one thing i do want to say also though about letting go i'm describing like letting go into

298
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:18,559
beneficial states but chances are if you've

299
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,960
had a practice you know that sometimes this letting go

300
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,159
we could also use this language of kind of like i've heard this language uh

301
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,360
purification cycles so it's this sense of

302
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:43,760
letting things get disgorged maybe something that's

303
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:51,279
i don't know exactly what's something that maybe we've been holding on to for a really long time that isn't helpful or

304
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,559
maybe we don't even know what it is but the sense of clearing out something

305
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:02,880
uncomfortable and or this sense of discharging or

306
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,000
maybe even vomiting up because sometimes practice is

307
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,799
painful and it feels like stuff comes up and maybe it gets expressed with tears or

308
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:21,200
gets expressed with nausea or something like this so

309
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,879
to be sure this letting go part can be uncomfortable

310
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:37,360
and we don't always like get to choose or dictate exactly how it happens

311
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,760
or when it happens or which manner or something like this

312
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,679
so this idea of maybe sometimes it's helpful to look at our practice

313
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:58,480
in a simple simplified way cultivation letting go

314
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,240
and maybe to look at in this big ways if we feel like we could use some support

315
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,358
maybe just uh is there is there something that wants to be let go

316
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,839
is there something that can be cultivated and maybe we don't even have to know precisely the

317
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,358
answer but it's just activity of asking that question is there something that

318
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,280
can be let go or something that can be cultivated

319
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,040
and just having that curiosity might be a way in which we can

320
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,440
i don't know something new can unfold and we can become aware of

321
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,319
to help guide us

322
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:52,320
so i offer this that may be a support for your practice and

323
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,480
your life this way of

324
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:05,800
cultivating and letting go thank you

325
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,800
and i wish if you'd like to ask some questions you you're welcome too or

326
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,480
i know i just sprung this on you jim about this idea i mean i didn't tell you before that i was going to open it up to

327
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,560
questions but if anybody has one or otherwise

328
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,000
we can call it an evening too

329
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:16,079
is it was on when you tapped it but now i

330
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,280
don't feel like i can't hear the microphone did it run out of juice

331
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,480
green lights fading is there another

332
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:34,320
maybe the these poor batteries you know maybe with this pandemic they sat there for a couple years

333
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:41,119
losing their juice how about this yeah there we go okay

334
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:47,520
um i hope this question doesn't seem too wonky or cerebral um

335
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,359
early in the talk you mentioned newer plasticity yeah

336
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:58,480
um this is something i've been wondering about for a long time

337
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:06,880
i associate newer plasticity mainly with if you've had a stroke

338
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:13,040
and then part of your brain just isn't functioning but over time and with effort

339
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,320
your brain your the neurons in your brain you affect a workaround

340
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,839
and you can regain movement that you didn't have or regained cerebral

341
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:30,960
ability that you had lost so the brain has this kind of rerouting

342
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,440
potential how about this though uh i think you

343
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:43,520
were referring to a different kind or maybe it's the same thing that's my question

344
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:51,119
if if we have bad habits or we've been conditioned in certain ways

345
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:58,240
and our brain our mind gets in this groove and it's really harmful

346
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:04,960
then we start to see because we bump into a a buddhist group or

347
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,920
read a book or we just saw someone doing something kind out on the street

348
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,200
and oh there's a different way but you can't just change right away it

349
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:24,720
takes effort effort effort but eventually it can wear some new grooves

350
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,320
would a neuroscientist think that that's newer plasticity also

351
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,920
that's my understanding that we can uh one think of neuroplasticity as any time

352
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,040
we learned something new actually there's new neuronal connections

353
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,440
that weren't there so one way we could understand it is like you know anytime you learn something new

354
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,680
and like really learn it then that's would be an example of neuroplasticity but you know bill i have

355
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,720
to say that this is not an area of my expertise so i i

356
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,640
appreciate what you're saying but i like this you're using this word grooves that's kind of how i think about

357
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:11,200
it too right is that what we do repeatedly it just becomes easier and easier to do just because

358
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,720
there's and i don't know how this works down at the level of the neurons

359
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:22,240
somebody does i'm sure our friends at mr mrs google know this type of thing

360
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,400
but so if the answer to my question is yes

361
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,720
then everything we're doing exactly here is newer plasticity yeah and our newer

362
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,880
plasticity makes it possible everything i would say that's that's my personal

363
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,160
assessment i also just want to thank you for your

364
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,560
talk i probably missed half of it because you said something that reminded me of

365
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,720
my situation and my thoughts were going off onto oh yes yes and i was feeling a

366
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,079
little oh yes and then it came back to your talk so thank you you're welcome you're

367
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:11,800
welcome bill okay thank you thank you all
