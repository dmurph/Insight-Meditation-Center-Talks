1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,040
so good evening and what i'd like to talk about

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,799
is one of the foundational teachings in our in trouble hearing

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:19,439
you will turn it up a little bit louder so let's see now is that going to be loud enough we also have hearings

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,840
hearing assistant devices that might help so good now okay

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,359
so um i'd like to talk about one of the foundational

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,718
you can call it teachings of our inside tradition

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,920
but i want to teach about one of the fundamental

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:51,360
set of qualities that we activate when we do mindfulness practice

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,719
there are qualities that get activated in anything we do in our lives they just that

10
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,960
many things get activated but these are kind of universal in some way and so they're useful both for our

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,280
practice that we do meditation or mindfulness in life and they're also useful for any activity

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,920
that we do to try to figure out a wiser way or a more satisfying way

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:23,119
to do it to engage in them and these are five uh kind of inner

14
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,560
gets activated it comes alive and they come alive in different proportions

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,400
different levels of proportions to each other and depending on how they come into

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,360
balance and what is strong and what is weak they can affect how we do things or how we engage in what we do in our life

17
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,479
and and how the meditation unfolds so these are five qualities that are

18
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:56,159
quite useful i think to memorize for yourself learn what they are and then have them as a reference point

19
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:03,360
so that after what at first it might feel like somewhat artificial to memorize this and think about them

20
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,599
but over time it becomes kind of second nature to do it it's kind of like riding a bicycle if

21
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,959
you first time you ride a bicycle as a kid perhaps it um

22
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,720
it's awkward and you know so many things to take care of you know you have to handle bars in one way and the pedal at

23
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,840
the same time keep your balance and and figure out where the brakes are and

24
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,040
you know it's a lot to figure out but after you do it a few times

25
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,800
at some point maybe it's really second nature to do it and all the little things that

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,720
seem so complicated at first to begin working together in harmony and at some point you take your hands

27
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,560
off the handlebar and say hey look you know hands-free pedaling because you have everything lined up

28
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,319
just right in the speed and everything so these five qualities then that we

29
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:02,000
want to learn and and make them second nature is tracking them is the what's called the five faculties

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,200
it's five and they are faith

31
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:15,040
and there's other english words to use for that engagement the effort we put into the

32
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,959
what we're doing attention or mindfulness itself

33
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,319
concentration the real ability to really focus on what we're aware of

34
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:33,680
and then uh insight or discernment the ability to be wise about what we see

35
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,959
and what our experience is to be discerning about the experience

36
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,840
so you know i think that if you ride a bicycle for example if you if you know

37
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,680
how to ride a bike and you're going to ride a bicycle from here to monterey

38
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,360
you would without even thinking about it these five faculties would come into play for you

39
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,959
you first you'd you probably wouldn't take that trip that far unless you had some faith that you can do it some

40
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,000
confidence you can do it and that confidence is probably necessary because if you don't have the

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,040
confidence the doubting of uh

42
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,239
your ability to get down there is probably going to undermine you and sometimes doubt becomes a

43
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:27,040
self-fulfilling prophecy i can't do it it's too hard and the very that very mindset

44
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,400
it drains us and interferes with us and it sometimes becomes true almost

45
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,080
because of that mindset but there has to be some confidence

46
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,440
and maybe the confidence is not very strong at first but then after you've gone 20 miles or

47
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,560
so far oh i can do this so you make it up over the santa cruz mountains

48
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,759
down to their side and then you have a lot of confidence then it's like okay now i think i can do it and then it's a

49
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,400
whole different feeling to go biking if you're if you're confident and then you have to engage

50
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,680
and you have to figure out how to engage depending on the slope and the terrain

51
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,880
that you're in you see the hill coming up in front of you and you realize okay i need to kind of

52
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,000
maybe pedal a bit harder now and get some momentum going up the hill or

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,680
i need to slow down because i have to kind of catch my breath to really be ready for going up that hill

54
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,520
and you get to the top of the hill and you coast down still downhill then you don't need to apply any effort

55
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,840
anymore and then you naturally know okay now all i have to do is use gravity and not coast down just make

56
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:41,520
sure i don't go too fast so you kind of are moderating and monitoring your energy levels as you go

57
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,520
and then you got to be mindful when you're biking like this there's a lot of traffic and cars and dangers on the road

58
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,880
and potholes and the dogs come running out and whatever goes on

59
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,680
and you can't really slip up in fact some people are probably have a higher level of

60
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,319
mindfulness spiking a trip like that than they do when they meditate because the consequences are so serious

61
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,520
if you don't pay attention and the feedback is very quick

62
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,600
and like i did when i was 14 and i was biking along and i was just

63
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,960
minding my own business until i ran smack into the back of a parked car with people inside the car

64
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,360
i wasn't paying attention to what i was doing just biking along look i don't know where i was looking at boom

65
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,759
and um so there has to be some mindfulness some attention

66
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,000
and then uh sometimes you're biking you need to stay focused really focused not just mindful but focusedly mindful

67
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,120
sometimes you really need to pay attention carefully to with the terrain the potholes and the

68
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,720
bumps and the rocks and sometimes you have to stay focused on the traffic and what's going on and you have to really kind of zero in

69
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,800
on what you're doing and how you're doing it and it kind of very kind of sometimes detailed focused concentrated

70
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,720
way if there's a lot of traffic that's going on you have to really navigate it carefully

71
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,680
you're probably not going to think about how you you know what was that problem i had on my taxes in april

72
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,400
you know you're probably not going to think about you know what am i going to have for dinner today or so whatever it is that those things fall

73
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,840
away because of the need to stay focused here and then sometimes you get up in a wide

74
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,120
open road where there's no cars and now it feels very relaxed and

75
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,880
and there you might let your mind roam a little bit and then you're not so focused

76
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,440
and then you have to have a lot of discernment when you're by ride the bike you have to kind of know i'll make all kinds of micro decisions

77
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,960
as you go along about exactly where the tires go in the road and

78
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,919
how fast and slow you go and where you fit on the road and when to slow down and when to go to speed up and there's a

79
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:04,000
lot of little decisions made some of them which are about sustaining your effort for the long trip

80
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,960
using and not exhausting yourself but to going you know figuring out how to go in a slow and steady space

81
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,199
pace so you get to the at the end on a long trip so so this is to suggest that this comes

82
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:23,840
into play in something as mundane as riding a bicycle you can do the exercise of almost

83
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,479
anything you do if you decide to make bread or cook something at home in the kitchen

84
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:38,000
those five in some degree come into play they come into play when we meditate

85
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,279
and so to be able to recognize them their presence in us when we meditate

86
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,320
allows us to make to be discerning and to adjust and and

87
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:55,200
adjust what's happening to create the conditions that are optimal for us to for the mind to be able to stay present

88
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,880
and grounded here and now and not wondering awful lot so confidence there needs to be faith in

89
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,600
what we're doing there confidence in our ability to do it and that's the the faith that paying

90
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,680
attention to the present moment is valuable it's not automatic as many people

91
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:23,040
discover when they sit down to meditate when they realize their mind has all kinds of other things in mind to do

92
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,760
and there is a certain compulsion to think all kinds of thoughts to be preoccupied with all kinds of

93
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,519
emotions and feelings and the pull into that world is so strong

94
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,920
that sometimes people never knew that that was the case when they just went about their ordinary life it's only when doing something like

95
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,480
meditation we try to try to not be lost in thought and preoccupation we can realize the

96
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,760
strength of it and i think it's probably fair to say that it represents that

97
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,680
something not you consciously but something in your system has a lot of faith

98
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,440
in reviewing the past and planning the future faith and the value of going off into

99
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,480
fantasies of all kinds have a lot of faith in churning resentments and bitterness

100
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:20,560
a lot of faith in kind of churning and staying kind of connected and kind of feeding anxiety

101
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,600
we wouldn't normally think we have faith in those but if an anthropologist from mars came

102
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:33,360
and studied human beings and they were able to kind of see what goes on in their minds they say wow these people worship

103
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,680
anxiety you know wow you know there's there's no requirement to be anxious all

104
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,839
the time but they just like love it they must have they just have this wonderful thing about anxiety and it's amazing

105
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,920
there's those people here but there's also those people who have a lot of anger and they must have like

106
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,040
you know and they have this altar you know they have this monitor that's like the altar

107
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,079
for anger they listen to politicians you know that they're

108
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:10,160
they really believe in its value and what we're doing in buddhist practice is as we do it over time

109
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,360
our value system begins to shift and our value of system tends to shift

110
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,480
to being more ethical more honest more kind more compassionate

111
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,279
and more not because we have to but because we start feeling and recognizing within us

112
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,320
that these things are just feel better these things feel right these feel less

113
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:41,200
stressful they feel more productive of having a good heart and so it just kind of becomes of a

114
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,640
natural thing over time the meditators tend to become more ethical their values change

115
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:53,040
but that change of value represents a change of where our faith is faith of where our trust or confidence

116
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,440
is at some point we start getting more and more confident in the value of being

117
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,480
present being attentive to what's happening in the present moment

118
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,120
it's not obvious to a lot of people it wasn't to me when my mother told me repeatedly growing up guilt pay

119
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,320
attention i mean i became a meditation teacher because partly of the karma of not listening to my mother

120
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:25,040
and you know i didn't hardly knew what she was talking about or was i certainly wasn't interested in her her

121
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,720
instructions to me as i walked mud across the carpet or something

122
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,440
and um so the so to begin valuing

123
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,880
the beauty the wonder the richness

124
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,639
of heightened sense of attentiveness to what's happening here and now

125
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,079
it becomes so marvelous this confidence in attention

126
00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:00,720
that it becomes more wondrous more valuable to feel connected to awareness

127
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,320
than it is to anything that awareness knows

128
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:13,200
so if i you know if i look at the bell i can get preoccupied with a bell and think about it and all kinds of things

129
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,720
but it's actually quite wondrous that i have the ability to see the bell

130
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,560
to understand this is about to recognize and the very fact of being conscious is

131
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,160
a miracle it's amazing that we should you know end up in a universe where

132
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:37,760
we're the recipients of this very rich capacity for consciousness and it's important to have to value

133
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:46,399
staying in this close connected to present moment consciousness because of how rich and wonderful and

134
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,760
what emerges from that world so over time having confidence in the

135
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,959
practice like this is valuable to do so when you sit down to meditate

136
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,480
you're less likely to wander often thought you're less likely to doubt yourself

137
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,880
and your abilities and the value of what you're doing and then meditation does involve

138
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,959
engagement putting an effort of some kind even if the effort is

139
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:21,360
dedicated ardent effort to stay relaxed

140
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,800
and i say it that way because many people as soon as you talk about effort people

141
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:33,760
kind of feel discouraged or feel upset or feel like oh no this meditation is a lot of work

142
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,600
but it's a lot of play it's a lot of it should be delightful

143
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:46,240
and to learn how to engage with our attention with the present moment in a way that does not feel like

144
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,480
work that feels enlivening that feels kind of like this oh this is this is a

145
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,519
good effort to make i feel clearer in the process i feel

146
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,639
more relaxed in the process i feel more

147
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:10,639
refreshed from it all so what kind of effort what kind of engagement allows us to feel that

148
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,880
one of the ways is to engage with a certain kind of wholeheartedness in the practice

149
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,240
where there is not com no complacency and no resistance

150
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:29,839
no kind of uh yeah no resistance to it and uh not not easy to do but when the

151
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,680
mind wants to do so many other things besides being present and we come back to the present moment come back to the

152
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:42,480
breath over and over again there can be discouragement wow this is hard i can't do it

153
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,759
not realizing that it's the very effort to very effort we made to come

154
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,279
back and wake up again and again that begins lighting a spark inside

155
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,320
allow something to grow and develop ten thousand times we have to bring our

156
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:06,480
mind back and wake up again and then slowly something begins to shift and change

157
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,199
to make an effort which the effort does not feel stressful it doesn't feel punitive

158
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:20,399
some people when the mind wanders off in thought um pounds back jerk their mind back

159
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,839
some people it's like they're playing a whack-a-mole with their mind you know to come back and there's like it's almost

160
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:33,759
you know it's really harsh the way people practice that kind of effort is not helpful

161
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,079
it but to make an effort that is uh an effort that like if you're biking all the way to monterey you want to take

162
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:46,240
your time and create an egg ride the bike in a way that sustains your effort over time

163
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,320
so with meditation how do you engage that's not too hard not too forceful

164
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,839
not too complacent but something that has the spark of clarity in it

165
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,000
a clarity which doesn't feel like it's work but feels like it's almost a natural

166
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,038
expression of our capacity to be present

167
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,640
and then mindfulness is the key of this this is the capacity not just to be

168
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,280
aware and attentive to the present moment but to have heightened clarity

169
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,520
of the present moment so we can recognize in some kind of detail or some greater

170
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,280
clarity what is actually happening here some people meditate doing mindfulness

171
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:40,640
practice and they're kind of soothing and soothing themselves into kind of a complacent relaxed

172
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:48,799
calm but dull calm but cloudy state and they might be improved

173
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,000
it might feel good because it's more relaxed than how they are we're in a stressed life

174
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,679
but in the long term that doesn't really sustain the practice and doesn't lead to the

175
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:06,000
kind of the to the greater benefits of this mindfulness practice we're looking for how to bring some

176
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,320
clarity to the present moment and i love the expression to wake up

177
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,640
we're waking up to experience to be awake to what is happening and why one of the reasons i like the

178
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,960
word awake is that um awake is kind of like opening the

179
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:32,000
windows of them of attention and then allowing the sights and sounds and smells to come in

180
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,840
being mindful for some people is an interpret that's work where you have to now stare at things and kind of

181
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,880
try to pierce what's going on to be awake is just to be available

182
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,480
with clarity and attention and so to start cultivating a capacity

183
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,960
for attentiveness to the present moment in a way that feels nourishing feel

184
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,400
supportive then there's a

185
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,679
concentration unification of the mind it kind of means that

186
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:12,799
you're now you're focused on what you're doing in the moment and so for meditation maybe you start organizing

187
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:20,640
yourself to be really focused on being present for the breath being present with your whole body

188
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,720
and so to really begin zeroing in kind of focusing but not like a laser

189
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,640
but rather as someone who's gathering together everything and bringing it all together

190
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,760
all of who you are incl it's more like this too is included as i be with the

191
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,520
breath this too this too is part of it there's no outside

192
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,200
but everything then is included for the purposes of kind of holding

193
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,919
the breathing whatever you're focusing on so to really stay and then part of concentration is sustaining the

194
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:03,120
attention continuously through time the continuity of attention just stay here stay here

195
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,240
stay here all these first four qualities

196
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,480
then support our capacity to be discerning to become wise about what's happening

197
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,840
to recognize that when we're how we're practicing is creating too much stress too much

198
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,760
strain that doesn't work to recognize when we're being too complacent and letting our mind drift

199
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,200
off into thought too much and just you know you know just you know just

200
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:38,559
comforting ourselves with fantasies about food or something uh to be discerning about uh

201
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:44,000
what we do with our discomforts in the body rather than struggling when we're

202
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,200
sitting not used to sitting in meditation posture parts of your body might start aching

203
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,640
and hurting and what is it useful to do people who know how to do it might find it useful

204
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,000
to bring their mindfulness to the pain as opposed to ignoring it

205
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,480
other people might say given how discomfort i have i think it's better if i mindfully move and change my posture

206
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,360
and not not continue with the pain or some people say i move every time i'm uncomfortable

207
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,480
that's what i do my whole life i think would be wise is to learn what's

208
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,640
going on for me when i'm always moving at every discomfort let me see if i can develop some patience

209
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,760
let me try to understand myself better what's operating when i move and shift

210
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,360
every little discomfort i have might discover you have a lot of aversion or a lot of fear that's

211
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,360
operating and so the discernment part is to understand what's going on to know how

212
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:48,720
to make adjustments in the meditation so you're more likely to wake be awake

213
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,159
more likely to be present in a useful way it's looking at the other four qualities

214
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,520
and saying do i need to call upon my faith in this practice

215
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:07,120
do i need to engage a little more wholeheartedly here is more attentiveness needed

216
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,799
is more focus and continuity of attention what's needed here

217
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:18,880
and and by asking those questions you know and being wise

218
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,280
then with time you become your own teacher just like if you bike from here to

219
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,200
monterey and you do that regularly after a while you become your own coach who's you know what you need to do in

220
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,200
order to sustain the journey the trip so over time you begin becoming wiser

221
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,960
and wiser about what's needed any given time you sit down to meditate

222
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:50,080
every day you're going to be a little bit different every day your life experiences are going to affect you in different ways

223
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:57,200
and sometimes you're going to sit down and be agitated sometimes you're going to be sit down and be tired sometimes you're going to be sit down

224
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,600
and be overwhelmed by things all kinds of things will come along in this human life of ours

225
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,679
and as you start having a sense of how to check in with yourself around these five

226
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,039
qualities you can kind of begin understanding how to shift and change

227
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:20,799
these qualities and adjust them to match the circumstance you're in

228
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:26,240
if you are really tired you might say i need to put more energy in here the

229
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,600
second quality if you feel overwhelmed maybe the concentration factor is the

230
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:40,960
most helpful thing because it kind of settles things down to just keep your focus on a simple thing like breathing

231
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,080
it's a classic thing to do when people are anxious is to take deep breaths there's something about

232
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,080
the being massaged by the rhythm of breathing in and out that can be very calming

233
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,720
so when overwhelmed maybe getting calm is what's needed if you're really discouraged maybe

234
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,279
try to remind once yourself of the fate your faith or think about what's inspiring that might inspire your

235
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:14,240
meditation practice so a life of discernment that we engage in this process ourselves

236
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,600
and then the wonderful result of that is that at some point in meditation you

237
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:26,640
become your own teacher and that's kind of the goal to get to learn how to be so you can

238
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,120
you can use meditation as a as a support for no matter what happens in your life

239
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,640
and if you engage in this process of meditation now

240
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,559
you'll be ready for a time when there's a crisis to be able to the meditation can help

241
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:50,000
you in a time of great challenge if you wait until the crisis to meditate

242
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,200
you won't get as much benefit so what i talked about today these five

243
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,760
qualities might seem a lot of work but if you just practice

244
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,440
sincerely your meditation i'm guaranteed that over a year or two

245
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,200
or something this will become second nature without knowing what they are

246
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,760
however knowing what these are these five qualities it's not meant to make you busy now

247
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:26,720
you know every time you go you go with measuring sticks and seeing how am i doing here but rather it's a little reference point

248
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,320
that's there in the back of your mind and so you kind of from time to time no

249
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:38,480
more likely to notice how this is working and uh and just kind of let it be a

250
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,000
gentle support a periodic support to find your way

251
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,039
as you go about meditate meditating in a calm relaxed way

252
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,400
you can consider okay i'm a little bit in balance this way and we'll balance this way

253
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:03,440
let me make a small adjustment here more energy here more calm here more concentration

254
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,520
maybe i should be more discerning maybe i'm sitting here a little bit too passive

255
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,880
not really engaged with what's going on let me see if i can try to understand a little better what i'm feeling and

256
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,799
what's needed here in this situation

257
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,279
so five faculties faith engagement

258
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,440
mindfulness concentration or calm and discernment

259
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,200
sometimes they call it's called wisdom

260
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:44,240
so those are my thoughts this evening do you have any do you want to ask any questions or clarifications or

261
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,799
about these five

262
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,158
any thoughts about them

263
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,320
your five faculties are all in perfect balance

264
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,520
so i feel like i'm i guess not a very sophisticated meditation

265
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:54,080
closer um is it green light on yeah it is

266
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,679
usually i'm too loud yeah maybe it's not up what number to say on your mic there's

267
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,840
our number on it number four

268
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,720
so i think now i hear it so i think of myself as a beginning meditator

269
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,799
and i'm happy with that um one of the teachers i listened to

270
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,919
described i don't know if you'd say consciousness or whatever is happening when you're

271
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:30,880
meditating but as kind of like a puppy you know this on and i like that imagery

272
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,159
so i kind of just watch my puppy

273
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:42,960
do its thing and just um you know come back to the breath in the

274
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,200
present moment but i feel a little uh i don't know the right words for it a

275
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,799
legit just kind of a a lightness to

276
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:02,399
uh playfulness to an exploratory attitude towards it like beautiful the

277
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:07,600
the way i've heard the puppy analogy is uh is you're training the puppy

278
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,360
but you're not punitive to the puppy for not listening you have to be very patient and over and over the repetition

279
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,880
and you do it in a kind way and it may be playful away and and

280
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:27,120
so you know just take your be very patient do it over and over again and and have a kind of a a yeah and i guess i feel i'm

281
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:34,399
not trying to train my puppy i'm just watching at this point yeah that's fine and then

282
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:40,320
the training part comes when you feel that you spend enough time drifting off and maybe maybe there's a way of having

283
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,480
a little bit more ability to stay grounded in the present moment so at some point it's not just

284
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,760
appreciating the play of the puppy but it's also trying to help the puppy not to always

285
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:58,450
poop in the house [Laughter]

286
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,000
i like i like the analogy of seeing your mind as a puppy

287
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:33,600
okay well thank you and if you have any if you do have questions you don't ask publicly welcome i'll be here a little

288
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:40,520
bit and uh wonderful to be here with you and thank you
