1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,759
so good morning everyone and can you hear me all right it's okay out

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:12,400
there so I want to start with a introductory

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,480
story to this talk it's a maybe

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,119
a teeny story maybe you'll think of it insignificant but it uh represents

5
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:32,398
something a real a really important turning point in my life so so at some point I spent about 3

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,559
years uh doing Zen training at a Zen Monastery here United

7
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,920
States and uh it was quite nice but you know it's kind of you're fully enter into that world it's deep in the

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,079
mountains there's uh you know it's 14 miles on a very small steep dirt road to

9
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:57,000
go into the national for National Forest lands in the middle of which is this

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,399
little Monastery and so was completely involved in that world for three

11
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,439
years and Zen training is done with a lot of ritual and there's a lot of ways

12
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,680
in which you uh you engage your body so for example if you want to step into the

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,240
meditation hle you you always have to step in with a particular foot first and

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,520
you can't just step in without foot and they just kind of casually walk around you have to have your hands in a

15
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,720
particular way as you walk through the meditation Hall and there's a a particular way of walking through the meditation you can't just take the

16
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,840
shortest route to your seat uh you have to kind of take a certain route around the place and and when you get to your

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,040
seat you just plop yourself down and kind of pick your nose a little bit and get

18
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,759
ready you would um uh you bow to your seat and then you turn around and you

19
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:59,079
bow away from your seat and then this particular way in which you turn around and sit down on the seat and and then

20
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:06,000
classically in then there's a particular posture you sit in and I mean most classically you sit in full Lotus

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,480
upright most people don't sit in full Lotus but half Lotus or quarter Lotus or

22
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:20,400
something but there's a very particular you it's very important that your back be straight and um and um and so there's

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,280
all these you know ways of being and being with other people you walk through the Montery and you see someone um you

24
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,640
bow to them and uh ideally you would stop and just stop and bow and so it you

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,480
know I think I counted how many times I had to Bow before 10:00 in the morning

26
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,680
and I think I got up to 54 boughs and all the things and that was not including all the people I had to stop

27
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,720
to on the path to bow to and there were some people including me occasionally

28
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:57,599
who would see someone coming down there and we'd go the other route so we wouldn't have we wouldn't have to

29
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,720
bow but the point being that uh a lot of the day was choreographed and they were

30
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:12,840
choreographed with these particular forms kind of ritual forms you took and they're quite powerful to to live in it

31
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,040
requires a lot of mindfulness and it requires a lot of presence and the the

32
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:26,040
some of these things you do with your body carry with them certain kind of attitudes certain kind of feelings that

33
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,560
uh affect you for one it's always done somewhat uh with intentionality and a

34
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,879
certain kind of of fullness you're really there to do each thing and so it

35
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,120
your sense of participating with your life comes alive in that kind of world

36
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,599
uh because you know you don't just sit back well you know go to the zendo when I feel like it and you know stumble in

37
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:55,720
and might really want to be here and you know you might have those thoughts but your body has to like really be there

38
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:03,400
and participate and and uh putting your hands together like this and all those bows we do there something even if you

39
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,319
don't want to Bow there's something about that movement that will probably affect a lot of people maybe different

40
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:14,599
people in different ways but for me it it developed a lot of uh gratitude a

41
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:20,120
sense of appreciation and and through the day heav bows little doing them

42
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,600
every day so many times through the day and for weeks and months on end

43
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:33,000
something begins to shift inside the same thing has happened happening for most of you in everyday

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,479
life uh in all the little movements that you make in your

45
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,560
body in your voice and your thing and and you're reinforcing something so if

46
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,520
you are going around kind of uh you know just kind of like uninterested in life

47
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:57,840
and you know everything you do you kind of do kind of like oh I'll get to it oh oh oh it's too hard oh who wants to do

48
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,520
this this is a drag or why we have to do this all those little voices might have

49
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,880
some value to them but the sum total of that kind of attitude it's kind of

50
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,240
dampens the energy it kind of drains a person it kind of doesn't bring a vitality and an engagement in life it's

51
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,520
more like keep pulling back pulling back and there's a lot of attitudes that we

52
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,680
do in our life that we do that we Express in all kinds of small ways and

53
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,000
some of those are not so great uh some I know some people who have an aversive

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,919
nature and there's something about saying little aversive statements uh

55
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:43,520
that little resistance statements that maybe one statement is okay but to do

56
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,720
them as many times as you bow in the monastery they tend to uh create a habit

57
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,039
a momentum a familiarity a sense of this is what I do so it becomes almost second

58
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:02,000
nature you don't even think about it anymore but have his little little you know pieces of aversion or pieces of

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,319
something or something that goes on so we're all in a Zen

60
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:16,599
Monastery we just don't know it in the sense that we're all doing something with our body our voices our eyes that

61
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:22,319
are uh expressing something or living something or carrying attitudes and

62
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:30,960
beliefs and sense of relationships and all kinds of things are being carried with it all the time but most of us

63
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,080
don't see most of what we carry most of what we're doing don't see the impact

64
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,240
that has on us so when I left at the monastery after

65
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,280
3 years where so much of the life was choreographed and it was kind of chosen

66
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,440
for me all kinds of things when to wake up when to go to the meditation Hall and

67
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,639
when to do this and that and how to do these things and the even eating was you

68
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:04,240
know most meals were carefully choreographed like you couldn't just like pick up your spoon and start eating

69
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,800
when you felt like it um you uh you have to wait for a bell and then you had to Bow a certain way you had to chant you

70
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,599
had to eat in a certain way you had this very unusual kind of eating utensils little bit and so the whole thing was

71
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:23,160
kind of choreographed and what was marvelous about eating in the monastery uh was we would eat the med in our

72
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:30,199
meditation posture and uh and just taking that posture that we've been meditating in is

73
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:36,280
very different than you know sitting at the table you know you know looking at the news on your phone while you're

74
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,159
shoveling food into your mouth which probably none of you

75
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:49,479
do and um you know you have to real you're really there and this is the this is this is the activity of the moment

76
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:57,479
you don't bring your phone with you into this zendo you know you know you you you know you're there we didn't have phones

77
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:06,360
then but I'm sure that they're not allow and and U and uh so so 3 years of that

78
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,639
when I left as soon as I left and came back to San Francisco I recognized something and

79
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:19,879
this was the Revelation that um now it's up to me to decide how to do

80
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,080
all these things and I had so much more Choice than I ever imagined I

81
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,759
had so I went to talk to the Abbot one day and it kind of formal discussion

82
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:37,560
about practice and I told him wow coming back to San Francisco you know so many things

83
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,200
are not choreographed anymore I have a choice and when I'm standing I have a

84
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,760
choice in how I stand when I sit in the chair I never thought I had a choice before I just sat

85
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,080
the way I sat I didn't think about it but I have a 100% choice about how I sit

86
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,200
in that chair do I slump do I i' I've sat in couches so so my shoulders were

87
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:07,600
in the crack you know you know you know all the way down you know just like you know just really

88
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:16,279
chilled and um and um the um so so do I sit ight do I use

89
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:23,839
the armrest do I what do I do and so I told him I have a choice and how I sit in the chair and he the abbit did

90
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:30,120
something very unusual he broke the the rituals or dro bro broke

91
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,880
the patterns of what you expect in a formal Zen setting he's in robes I'm in robes we're sitting meditation posture

92
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,320
having the serious conversation maybe 6 o' 5:00 in the morning you know uh I

93
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,440
told him this and he lifted out his hand and shook my

94
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,959
hand it was like congratulations you understood something really important

95
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:59,399
now I felt it was a real affirmation that I had a choice I had

96
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,640
had a lot of choices to make and I have much more choices to

97
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,880
make in my life than I'd realized before I started the monastery we have choices actually every

98
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,079
moment of our life we have choices and if you don't see you have

99
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:22,160
choices you don't have choices but if you see you have choices

100
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,120
does that mean now you have a burden oh more more choices to make it's

101
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,720
exhausting but but we're making the choices anyway we're making the choices

102
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:41,079
subconsciously and the choices we make make a difference and so what Buddhist practice

103
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:49,639
has a lot to do is recognizing the places of choice and learning to make wise choices

104
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:55,360
beneficial choices and um and that involves

105
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,920
something as small as how you sit in a chair something as small as how you stand how you look how you think what

106
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:10,360
you're thinking about I was coming down here to talk about this walking down here so I was thinking about this so it

107
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:18,000
occurred to me well Gil you have a choice now how you think about this and as as soon as I thought about

108
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,560
that oh okay uh let me look and see how am I thinking about talking about the

109
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,360
choices we have and I said oh I'm probably a little bit uh little bit

110
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,639
contracted in the mind little bit tense little stressful because after all I'm talking in front of all these people and

111
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:41,959
I don't have to do that I don't have to be worried about what I'm going to talk about uh I want to talk about this thing

112
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:47,360
because I think it's important and helpful what if I just shift how I think

113
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,519
and just think kind an easy way and think about it from how it's helpful for people and let me think in a way that's

114
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,959
helpful for me let me think a way that's beneficial for me so I shifted how I was

115
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:06,320
thinking and became really Pleasant to think about giving the talk I think I became a better person because of it then I had

116
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:14,399
you know the difference was not that great the shift was you know one degree or something but um but the um right

117
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,680
there there was a choice in how I think about something so one of the purposes of

118
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:27,000
meditation in Buddhism is not to make you calm and that's it not to give you

119
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,600
some wonderful experience and that's it it not to make you peaceful and that's it but rather one of the important roles

120
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,880
of meditation is to help you into a little

121
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:48,000
or better State of Mind of Heart of being than you were before you meditated

122
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,399
and I say this intentionally just a little so you don't have a high

123
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:59,360
bar it means that if you're feeling kind of lousy that day

124
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:06,399
and you just feel a little bit less lousy you've made it a little bit better so the bar is

125
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,639
low but uh you make yourself better than you are any other if you didn't

126
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:19,079
meditate and that that way of feeling better now becomes a reference

127
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:24,600
point for you to understand what kind of choices you want to

128
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,720
make how you want to now to go do what you want to do next next because you can

129
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:37,000
see if I don't do anything if I don't pay attention here that's a choice if I

130
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,279
don't pay attention you just go back into all the things I have to do pretty quickly I know the what all the demands

131
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,600
and the difficulties I have I'm going to get feel lousy again I'm going to feel really stressed out

132
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,399
again but you know I have a choice here do I just go back Barrel ahead and

133
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:02,399
forget about my meditation or do I use this feeling better as a reference point and see can I stay

134
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,120
close to this can I be careful not to abandon it how would I CH what do I

135
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,600
choose to do next so I stay closer to that I maintain it a little bit well

136
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,759
maybe I get up and I don't rush maybe I get up and I don't pick up

137
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:26,040
the most difficult thing to do maybe I get up and don't immediately check for emails because that just pulls me back

138
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,959
into that world maybe there's something maybe there's something worthwhile to maintain

139
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:37,199
how I'm staying right now and if I maintain it uh not only maintain it let

140
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,800
me not forget forget this state let me stay close to it I'm feeling better

141
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,279
after all let's stay close to it now is that selfish is that

142
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,680
indulgent it can be but if you pay as you do this practice you get more and

143
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,959
more sensitive that's the other purpose of mindfulness practice is not only to give you a better reference point in

144
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:07,079
which to understand your life but it's also to uh show you give you a much more

145
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:13,320
cute sensitivity Attunement with yourself that you see

146
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,959
all the little choices you make oh I don't have to do

147
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,160
that right now I'm I'm kind of abandoning right now I'm giving myself

148
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,240
giving giving myself over to boredom giving myself over to disc enouragement

149
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,759
giving myself over to desire I'm giving my over to the

150
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:40,120
anger is that what I want to do when I'm feeling kind of calm to begin with is

151
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:46,880
there another way of going about this next is another way of sitting is another way of standing another way

152
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,959
another way of you know whatever you're going to do is there a way of doing it

153
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:57,920
that makes things better or at least keeps things as better as they've gotten to

154
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:05,639
be so this last week uh my morning teaching that I did some of you know the

155
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:12,560
theme was don't make it worse and one of the things I I tried to

156
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,000
emphasize is that this little slogan don't make it worse whatever whatever you're going to do just simply don't

157
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,880
make it worse is very powerful and it encompasses the profundity of the

158
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,800
Buddhist teaching if you really understand uh how far and deep deep this

159
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:36,920
topic of don't make it worst can go but the Buddha had more to say than

160
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:44,959
don't make it worse he said make it better and this is a central principle

161
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:51,319
in the Buddhist teachings for how we live our lives how we engage in our

162
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:57,000
lives we based on these two things don't make it worse make it

163
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,319
better he didn't use those that language that's colloquial English uh his ancient

164
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:07,480
way of talking about it um if I told you would put you to

165
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,520
sleep or worse just like oh my God I can't believe all these

166
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,520
words um uh you know sometimes he was so precise and careful in what he was saying that he had a lot of words to do

167
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:27,000
it and it starts feeling kind of too technical or to something and um but I I can give you a

168
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,400
little bit better colloquial sense of what he said said he

169
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,160
said if you're making it worse

170
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:47,799
stop if you're not making it worse protect yourself from making it worse in

171
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:53,240
the future so that's a little bit more

172
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,120
colloquial then he went on to say um if you're not making it better

173
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,080
start doing it if you are making it better and I

174
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:11,159
think he loved making things better because these first three he said stop

175
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:18,080
protect yourself from doing it and and start but this fourth one if you are

176
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:25,720
making it better he said um stay close to it maintain it

177
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,760
don't forget it don't lose track of it

178
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:37,840
uh increase it make it and a wonderful word in poly

179
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,360
but uh make it abundant what having better be abundant sense of

180
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:50,200
abundance I mean that's like you know not being less grumpy that's like something

181
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,559
else and then cultivate it and bring it to

182
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:01,440
fulfillment bring it to its fullness I mean there all these things so that he

183
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,720
was that's what he was was most into if you could do the first three that prepares the ground so you

184
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,760
can really get involved in the last one isn't that good so the Buddha what

185
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,039
Buddhism is not just about not suffering it's about cultivating and

186
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:26,799
developing and growing and staying close to something you've learned for yourself

187
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:34,159
that's wonderful something you've learned that's worth staying close to and developing and that

188
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:40,679
something is and this is a very important part of this is that uh when

189
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,840
he wouldd have said don't make it worse make it better absolutely it can apply

190
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,400
to the world around you but where we have the most choice where we have the most uh

191
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:59,520
opportunity to make a difference is in ourselves in the quality of our inner

192
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,679
life the quality of our heart the quality of our mind that what's happening there and how we're responding

193
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:12,799
to the world and reacting to the world that's where we have the most opportunity we can't control the weather

194
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:20,039
so well usually but we can do the right thing we can get an bring with an umbrella for

195
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:26,120
example you can't necessarily prevent certain illnesses that happen but you

196
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:32,760
have some choice about how you relate to being sick you can't necessarily Choose

197
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:39,760
You Know politics and what party is in office but you can choose something

198
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:46,480
about how that you allow that to affect your inner life and what do you what do you give yourself over to or abandon

199
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,280
yourself to as if it's has to be that way or there's authority to these feelings these

200
00:20:52,280 --> 00:21:00,520
attitudes there's the place we can make the most difference where we have the most choice is in

201
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:06,799
ourselves and uh in one way I I love how it plays out in life is that sometimes

202
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:14,240
we have to make big choices in life and it's hard sometimes to make those decision decisions and sometimes there's

203
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,760
no real way of knowing what's which is going to be the right decision partly because we don't know what's

204
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,360
coming we don't know what what uh will you know that decision will you know

205
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:33,960
take us to a place in a time and situation where things that are out of our control will happen and affect what

206
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:40,080
happens and so sometimes every decision is the right

207
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:47,320
decision or you know two different decision can be both can be equally good who knows what the right one is how some

208
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:54,000
decisions become right and wrong is not by the decision but how we live with the

209
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:02,640
decision the choices we make after we make that decision how we live with the consequences of it and that's where we

210
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,559
make the best of it so looking at so we start taking responsibility for the

211
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,200
choices we make and the one that again the Buddha focused on the most for

212
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:20,799
practitioners was the Cho how these decisions affect our inner life and

213
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,159
that's why meditation can be so helpful because we're learning about the

214
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:33,039
ins and outs of our inner life we're learning about the operating principles of how we get caught how we get

215
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:39,240
reactive uh the choices we make the values we live by the priorities we make

216
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:46,000
the biases we have uh if you start being mindful carefully Mindful and you have a

217
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,320
vantage point of calm a vantage point a reference point of some degree of peace

218
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:59,880
or well-being uh and you pay careful attention what takes you away from that

219
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,840
boy you'll learn a lot about yourself and so one of the practices I

220
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,000
recommend when you finish meditating appreciate whatever

221
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,640
way you're a little better and then stay you know try not to

222
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,960
rush into your life right away pay attention and notice when you start

223
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,799
losing that when you're not feeling quite as calm or quite as settled or a little bit now

224
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:38,080
you're you know you're getting starting to rush and you're not paying so much careful attention anymore so when you

225
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,320
find yourself losing that this is probably the most important

226
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:49,200
moment in the wake of meditation the moments you're losing what you had that

227
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,000
felt good for you at that moment uh

228
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,240
stop maybe sit down close your eyes just just pause and take a good look what

229
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:07,240
just happened what was I believing what was my attitudes what were the desires what

230
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:14,240
were the um um attitudes what what what happened that I got caught now so I'm

231
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:21,400
rushing what what happened now so now that I'm I you know I was fine I felt confident and now I feel

232
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:29,120
discouraged I was feeling peaceful and now I'm agitated I was feeling happy and now I'm sad depressed

233
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:35,960
despairing what happened there in that interface and it might happen so quickly

234
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,159
that you might not see the first day the second day but at

235
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:48,039
some point you say oh look at that um I felt that life was going to

236
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:54,480
leave me behind and I can't be left behind all my friends will leave me behind if I don't answer all those

237
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,360
emails people will be angry with me and there's oh that's what triggers me

238
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:08,279
that's what gets me caught I have this belief this little voice inside do I have to believe it is it

239
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:14,399
true is there another thing that can be done is it worth the sacrifice is it

240
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:19,880
worth giving up feeling better for feeling

241
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:26,240
worse and just that question is it better to give up feeling better for

242
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:34,679
feeling worse is a powerful question to ask yourself it's and if the lawyers of the

243
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:39,880
Mind come and explain to you all the reasons why you have to make be worse

244
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:46,480
you have to put up with it because you know you better question

245
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,919
that you better get a new lawyer and you know bring it to the

246
00:25:51,919 --> 00:26:00,000
court and really have a discussion and what we learn over time I

247
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:09,559
hope is that we learn to cultivate um a healthy inner life and learn how to

248
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:15,640
stay close to that and value it and see how many benefits come from it and we

249
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,399
learn to recognize when the inner life feels healthy and not so then the Buddha

250
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:29,120
when he had this teaching about stop prevent the making it worse initiate

251
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,159
making it better and then keep making it better uh what he what he actually said

252
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,520
was not worse and better he used a word in ancient language that can usually

253
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:48,279
translate into English in two different ways one is uh it translates as

254
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:55,120
skillful and skillful also can mean ethical is it does it does it is it not

255
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:02,200
is it is it is it avoiding causing harm it's it's doing the opposite of

256
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:08,120
causing harm bringing benefit so so skillful is it skillful

257
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,480
but it's also translated into Engish as wholesome is it wholesome or UNH

258
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:21,520
wholesome and that really takes you into yourself does it feel like a right

259
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:28,200
wholesome healthy beneficial skillful ethical thing to do we have an inner

260
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,399
reference point the inner sensitivity to feel when something feeds us and

261
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:39,679
nourishes us and makes us feel better and makes us feel Freer and More Alive

262
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:46,760
in a good way and we have a capacity to feel when we we do does the opposite

263
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:54,080
when it makes this feels UNH wholesome it seems it it Den nourishes me it undermines me it drains me it makes me

264
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,440
smaller or contracted or tighter or makes me feel kind of

265
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:07,360
um uh you know kind of uh stressed by just by the what's going on in the inner

266
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,159
life so we don't always know how to make the world around us better we don't

267
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:18,679
always know when we can when we're making it worse maybe unconsciously or

268
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:24,919
by accident unintentionally but we can track it for

269
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:30,320
ourselves and we can we can and it's in invaluable to do

270
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,720
that and to start doing that in a way you know so that you start slowly but

271
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,559
start doing it to become second nature so that and this is what's happened to me over these years of

272
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:50,600
practice so much of this is just second nature it's like riding a bicycle your whole body body and mind

273
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:58,519
makes a lot of teeny decisions on the whole bike ride leaning this way that way it's

274
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:03,600
going faster slower Shifting the weight of your body where to look and you know

275
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,440
it's making but it's second nature to do it after a while when you first start it's stressful but after a while it's

276
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:16,679
actually relaxing to do it to be that fully engaged and participate in your life with something you have Mastery

277
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:22,080
over it's possible to develop Mastery over all these decisions you do

278
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:28,720
throughout the day how you stand how you sit how you look at somebody how you're

279
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,880
with someone I've learned at some point in that Zen practice I learned that how I

280
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:43,200
was with people was not their present attentive available

281
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,720
receptive I was turning away feeling embarrassed feeling shy feeling afraid

282
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,320
feeling like um you know like I didn't know what I was supposed to do and I had to be really

283
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,720
small there's all these ways in which I was present for other people that I didn't

284
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,440
know but the Zen training partly because in

285
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:14,080
Zen you're you're sitting every day many hours in an upright open chested firm

286
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,039
meditation posture and so after a while with that reference point I could see when I

287
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:25,519
collapsed I could see when I turn my body away I could see all these little

288
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:31,840
cues that represented not a good way to beat with other people and I learned

289
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:39,559
what if I just there relaxed full open it's really nice I was I was I saw someone this

290
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:45,360
weekend this last few days it was kind of facilitating a very

291
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:53,159
difficult conversation with a group of people and she had those qualities in her it was remarkable every difficult

292
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,360
thing that was thrown at her she was just there and thank you and just like

293
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:07,000
okay and she didn't cringe she didn't pull down she didn't get defensive she didn't get like trying to um apologize

294
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,840
in some kind of inappropriate way or you know she's just oh okay okay well now

295
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:18,960
we'll take this into account okay and it felt so friendly and so caring and this

296
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:26,440
is someone who had practiced for years that she had that ability and it felt to me like it was second

297
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:34,120
nature so in summary there's something really

298
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:41,799
powerful very profound in the simple statement make it

299
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:49,799
better and to use that as a guideline as it go through don't forget that as it go through your life if that's

300
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:55,000
too much for you if that's too sacran and too idealistic and too like you know

301
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,600
I don't deserve it well then the next best thing is

302
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:08,120
don't make it worse at least don't make it worse but you can make it better and one

303
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,720
of the purposes of meditation is to give you the information give you a reference

304
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:20,080
point for better so you know how to do this in your daily life you have a guide

305
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:28,360
you have a support you have a reference point for it and and don't look for

306
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:35,440
Grand spirituality don't look for The Big Bang experiences of Enlightenment don't look

307
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:44,760
for you know great states of Peace build towards that with every with

308
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,120
little one drop at a time with one little moment at a time in these little

309
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:56,000
details of how you live your life of how you stand how you sit how

310
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,440
you walk how you speak speak how you listen how you

311
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,919
engage with your computer with your device so many people lose themselves in

312
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:14,120
those and youve probably seen a lot of people out in the world that completely lost and absorbed in a way that doesn't

313
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:20,950
seem good of course you don't know you don't do that [Laughter]

314
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,080
right pay attention pay attention to how you make

315
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:34,240
things worse at least try to stop that try to make it

316
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,279
better and you do it don't you don't just do it for yourself you do it for the

317
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:44,919
world because the more that you learn to do this for yourself the more you're

318
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:50,519
available to the world in a good way when you cultivate and develop the

319
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:56,720
wholesome in yourself that wholesome spills out as whole

320
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:03,840
wholesome interactions wholesome ways of being in the world with other people if we do what's UNH wholesome for

321
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:11,079
us Den nourishes us it's hard to then come back to the world in ways that

322
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:17,760
benefit the world as well so so with all this I hope now you

323
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,878
appreciate this little slogan make it better and you see the

324
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:31,919
value of that so um maybe we're so we're you know it's well

325
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:38,118
before the usual official ending time here at 10:45 is when we end and uh we

326
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:45,000

327
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,760
introduce yourself to a couple of people next to you and maybe have a little conversation about uh did any of this

328
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,760
talk have any meaning for you there was any any reference point in your life for how this could be useful

329
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:04,480
um and um and uh and you might um consider as

330
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,880
you have that conversation that very principle so it's very easy for for some

331
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,599
of us include myself to respond to things with that's not going to work

332
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,160
that's not right you know and then it's true if you believe that but there might

333
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:29,640
be one circumstance in your life where what i t about today will be beneficial for you if you only look at how that's

334
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,800
that that's that doesn't work that I I don't believe in what he had to say well that's okay I don't want I don't want to

335
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:42,720
take that away from you but uh but if there even if it was one circumstance in once in your hundred

336
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,359
years of your life that this teaching is useful then you'll benefit from this

337
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:55,200
teaching so uh so that's what you know so you so maybe you can try to benefit from the conversation by talking about

338
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,640
how it might be useful for you but you don't have to if you don't want

339
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,880
to so anyway it's mostly just say hello and we have a tea so it's nice with people who are new to be to be met with

340
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,200
someone and welcomed and included here and meet someone and and that way you know maybe you want to stay for the tea

341
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,920
and continue your conversations so we'll have about probably about five minutes just to chat and talk and look around so

342
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:26,240
that no one's left kind of sitting alone to just look around and invite them into your group or whatever and then um and

343
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:37,319
