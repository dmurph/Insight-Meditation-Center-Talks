00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,519
good morning friends lovely to have this opportunity to be

2
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,200
here with you um i feel delighted to be taking

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,200
gill's place this week and to spend a little time with you

4
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,520
gil i'm susie harrington if you turned on your screen and expected to see gil you

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,120
now have a new person and i'll be doing the

6
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,320
guided meditation in dharmet this week and gil

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,640
invited me to come he specifically was hoping that i would offer some

8
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,560
guidance some instruction around practice in nature since

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,320
although i'm also a residential retreat teacher i particularly

10
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,600
enjoy and am committed to practicing outdoors and sharing that

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,759
with people in the natural world so there's

12
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,920
probably like many of you i spent i spend a lot of time outside when i can

13
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,560
and i spent years as a backcountry ranger and a lot of time hiking

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,200
and through those years i noticed something that i was outside i

15
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,200
was in the natural world i really loved being there

16
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,600
but there was still some distance some disconnect my mind still sort of ran the

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,560
show and the stories would still go in my mind and there was a

18
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,119
contactfulness with nature that i didn't i felt like it sort

19
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:16,000
of came in glimpses but wasn't there a lot of the time and so as i

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,120
developed my dharma practice and as i developed as a

21
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,800
teacher one of the things that became very important to me was this

22
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:34,000
was a curio this ongoing inquiry about how does the natural world how is

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,400
it collaborator friend participant teacher

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,440
and the the buddhist

25
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,120
practice is very very rooted in the natural world the buddha

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,280
was born outside became enlightened under a tree taught for

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,599
the many decades outside died outside all of those things

28
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,800
so it this is nothing new

29
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,720
this isn't something different that i'm suggesting it's that

30
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,480
uh bringing it into our practice as we do it now and what are the

31
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,280
opportunities there and how can we explore this and one of the clearest and most direct

32
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,480
ways in that the buddha mentioned a lot is through the practice of working with

33
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:39,440
the elements and you may be familiar with the fact that that's in the sati patana suta he

34
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,959
mentions the elements practice is one of the foundational practices

35
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,080
and he uses the elements in many other places as well

36
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,159
so this is the way that i'm going to explore it and offer it this week

37
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,159
so before we go into the guided meditation i want to read one quote that is

38
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,959
a lovely quote of the buddha talking to his son rahula

39
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,400
and making a suggested a suggestion to him about

40
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,040
his practice his meditation practice and this is what he says

41
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,479
rahula develop meditation that is like the earth

42
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,600
for then agreeable and disagreeable sensory impressions will not take charge

43
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:39,440
of your mind just as when people throw what is clean and unclean on the earth excrement urine

44
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,600
saliva pus or blood the earth is not horrified humiliated or

45
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:53,199
disgusted by it in the same way agreeable and disagreeable sensory impressions will

46
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,160
not take charge of your mind when you develop meditation like the earth

47
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:07,440
so as we begin to sit this is the first aspect of doing the

48
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:14,080
elements and today i'm going to introduce and work with the earth element and this is the first aspect of

49
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,960
it that i'd like to offer and that we can explore in our practice is this sense of stability

50
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,080
the groundedness we often use that phrase i wish i i feel grounded i don't

51
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,960
feel grounded i wish i felt more grounded and i think there's something in that what we're commenting is how

52
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:40,400
earth contactful do we feel how stable on the ground with our root with our feet as

53
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:48,320
roots in the ground that we can hold steady when what is difficult comes along

54
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,639
so this first practice this week will be an earth element

55
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:01,919
meditation so go ahead and find your meditation posture make yourself

56
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,120
comfortable and find a nice upright

57
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,319
posture that has a sense of dignity with it

58
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:21,638
and allow yourself to relax allow yourself to soften

59
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,199
relaxation in the shoulders

60
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,800
relaxation around the eyes

61
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,240
and as you settle into your posture allow yourself

62
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,800
to feel the contact with the ground

63
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,680
perhaps your feet perhaps your legs

64
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,520
certainly your buttocks in contact with the cushion or the

65
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:21,680
chair and whether you're literally on the ground or 10 stories up you're still in contact

66
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,440
with the density of the earth all the way

67
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,639
wherever you are it's reaching up and pulling down to you gravity is like the hug of the earth

68
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,800
pulling us towards it themselves

69
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,360
feel the pressure and the contact of that

70
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,680
giving yourself a few moments here at the start of the practice

71
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,000
to really land where you are

72
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,640
whatever you've already done today setting that aside

73
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,480
and as you land in this spot allow yourself to sense

74
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:57,720
the environment around you the space the room or the outdoors that you're in

75
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,640
and as we settle in i want to invite you to feel the earthiness

76
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,560
of yourself to feel the hardness the density that you carry

77
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:36,759
around as part of your body your body is made of earth element

78
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,040
so feeling perhaps first the hardness of your teeth

79
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,399
the hardness of your bones this skeleton that is allowing you to

80
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:57,360
sit upright we have these very dense core aspects of

81
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,600
us that are like a kind of mineralized rock in fact

82
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,320
and where this hardness meets the pull of the earth

83
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,480
you can feel pressure

84
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,519
this is the earth element earth contacting earth

85
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:38,560
your flesh too not just the bones has lots of earth element

86
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,839
when we eat food and digest it we're bringing in

87
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:52,079
earth moving it around changing it incorporating it in our bodies

88
00:10:52,800 --> 00:11:02,959
we take in the earth and we become we are part of the earth

89
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:13,480
we come from the earth and we will return to the earth

90
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,480
feel the density the hardness

91
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,920
the pressure

92
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,079
of your own body sitting here and feel the contact it's making with

93
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:46,839
the earth feel how you are not so different than a boulder sitting on earth

94
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,680
and as you sit there realizing that you're made of earth that you're part of the earth

95
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,600
allow your attention to take in more fully the earth below you

96
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:31,279
have a sense also of its density its vastness and abundance

97
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:38,800
you might feel it flowing down below you almost as if you had a tap root going

98
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,040
down into the earth or perhaps your roots are more spreading

99
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,440
spreading out in all directions

100
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,000
let your attention flow down to the ground

101
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:06,680
perhaps even you might notice that you could grow roots down into the ground

102
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,720
you might even imagine that your breath comes up out of the

103
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,160
earth through those roots breathing up taking in the nourishment

104
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,920
of the earth and as you exhale letting your breath

105
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,040
flow back down through these roots down below you

106
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,920
out into the ground

107
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:57,199
feel your own weight you too are dust soil

108
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:05,040
mineral earth sitting on earth

109
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:13,720
you are earth breathing what a miraculous thing

110
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,279
breathing for the earth

111
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,240
allowing your attention to flow down

112
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,120
and to come back

113
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,760
earth sitting on earth sitting like a mountain

114
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,360
can you be steady feel

115
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,360
this stability this contactfulness with the ground

116
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,799
this vast and expansive and supportive ground

117
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,600
the earth is a vast lap of belonging

118
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,720
you belong here

119
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,840
simply because you are of this earth

120
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,960
it could never be otherwise

121
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:10,000
allow yourself to receive this hug this pull of the earth

122
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:18,000
relaxing the body trusting the structure

123
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:26,720
of your own skeleton this uprightness of earth sitting on

124
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,720
earth

125
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,919
you

126
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,320
allow yourself to rest knowing that you belong

127
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:02,480
that you are part of this earth an active walking breathing

128
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,760
sitting [Music] expression of earth

129
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,919
you

130
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:33,279
feel the density of your body the contactfulness of the pressure

131
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,120
the contact with ground

132
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:47,080
feel the supportive and vast density of the earth

133
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,320
letting your roots grow deep your breath

134
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:08,159
enlivening and further contacting

135
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,480
this earth

136
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:04,539
[Music]

137
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:40,120
so continuing from that earth element

138
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:51,200
and hopefully you felt as you were sitting one of the ways that we can

139
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,279
contact the earth earth element this way of

140
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:04,000
sensing the stability i mentioned the word contact fullness a

141
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,039
lot it's like we all want contact and you know we might look to other

142
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:17,919
people for contact or to situations but the contact is built right into us

143
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:24,480
we're right here in contact with ground with earth with the earth in us

144
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:31,760
all the time and in that contact with the earth

145
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:37,679
with this earth element we're also in contact with a very

146
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,559
this groundedness a deep equanimity

147
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,480
a right here-ness

148
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,679
so this is one of the aspects of the earth element that we can take into our

149
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,720
practice and we can do it practice it as we did here you can practice it when you're

150
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,480
walking you know if you're doing walking meditation you can feel the contact

151
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,679
fullness with the ground and let yourself touch

152
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,520
and uh let the roots of your feet go down into

153
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,200
the ground as if when you were walking

154
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:35,800
as if when you were walking you had you were plant moving walking

155
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:50,800
another aspect of the earth element that's very important and this is true of all the elements

156
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:57,200
is a very fundamental teaching of the buddha around not-self

157
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:04,640
and here's what he says about practicing with the earth element internal and external

158
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,680
he said internal and external are simply earth element

159
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,079
and that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus

160
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:25,760
this is not mine this i am not this is not myself

161
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,520
this is a very important aspect of the elements and you

162
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,920
heard me just touching on this in the guided meditation this recognition

163
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,680
that earth element is flowing through us

164
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:51,440
that we eat and we digest and it becomes part of us and

165
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,280
then it flows out we either shed it off our skin or we

166
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:06,800
leave it in the toilet or ultimately it all goes from our bodies when we pass

167
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,760
that all of the earth element that is here is only temporarily borrowed

168
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,520
and we can recognize oh look this is just flowing through this

169
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,720
is not mine this is not me there is no inside

170
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:33,760
outside it's simply earth element moving around and i'm part of the place it moves to

171
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,200
and when i go for a walk it's earth element going for a walk

172
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:45,119
and in this we can sense that we're part of a flow a continuity

173
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,400
that we are earth come alive

174
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,720
but we haven't separated and this is so important

175
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:04,640
we are we live in a world that is in the trauma of separation

176
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,880
and how do we release that belief that idea that

177
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:18,400
somehow we're separate that nature is outside earth is outside other

178
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,240
people are outside because when we think we're separate

179
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,400
that sets us up of course to abuse the

180
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:37,838
earth to view the earth as somehow something to be extracted from

181
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:44,320
to like separate and this is also leads to

182
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,160
separation of other people of other creatures

183
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,560
and otherness and so this oh look we're all made of the same

184
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:03,119
thing it's all just earth element moving around

185
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:09,680
dropping the ownership the colonial mindset that makes us think

186
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:16,320
we can own a piece of land actually the land owns us

187
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,838
we belong to it

188
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:33,280
another aspect so we're working on this journey towards dropping the separation and one

189
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,440
of the doorways to that is recognizing

190
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:47,320
the generosity the exchange is not just uh

191
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:53,920
there's not just a mechanical there's a generosity of exchange happening here

192
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,880
when we eat we're eating this incredible abundance of the earth

193
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,720
i love walking through my garden and right now there's strawberries out there

194
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:13,200
and they there's not so many that um i can pick a big basket of them but

195
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:19,040
there's just the right number that every time i walk by i can lean down and pick

196
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,280
one and be reminded of the abundance of the earth

197
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,040
and i i noticed that this is one of the things i love walking

198
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:39,200
around in the world in the natural world it's like when there's berries and you pick a raspberry

199
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,839
or a huckleberry or perhaps the mountains near here got a lot of

200
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:52,160
rain this summer and it's to go and look at the mushrooms and to pick the few

201
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,280
mushrooms that are actually edible and to just be amazed that these things come

202
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,839
up out of the ground and then they come into this body and we're involved in this

203
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:09,119
generous exchange and then there's simpler ways i was just

204
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,640
out leading a river retreat out on the river and it was hot

205
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,960
and the simplicity of sitting beside a boulder in the shade of it

206
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:28,400
the generosity of the boulder's shade the generosity of a tree and sitting

207
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,440
under it the generosity of the breeze moving the

208
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,880
leaves the leaves or earth element being flicked

209
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,960
in the breeze we can receive the generosity and the abundance

210
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,000
of the earth in so many ways and as we do that

211
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,359
we naturally have this desire to want to give back to it

212
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:00,880
to realize we're in this flow and this leads to another way

213
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,560
that we can recognize and participate in our earthiness

214
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:13,440
that we are the that we can take care

215
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,640
of the earth and everybody's felt that like when you

216
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:25,599
go out and you you know the simplest way is out in a garden or with plants

217
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,960
but when you make compost if you've ever done that it's quite miraculous

218
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,400
that you can take all these different things and you put them in a pile and they get all hot and then they

219
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:43,760
turn into the soil and earth ready to grow again

220
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,559
the reciprocity of taking care of places that we know

221
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,040
simple things picking up trash that isn't there or perhaps you write letters

222
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:03,640
or enact actively defend places

223
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:11,680
edward abbey a person from here from this area that i live in moab utah

224
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,839
have once said the wilderness needs no defense just more defenders

225
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:23,920
and we all can participate the generosity flowing in and flowing

226
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,640
out it's a reciprocal relationship

227
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:48,400
i'm going to end by reading you a short poem from rabbidranath tagore

228
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:56,480
the same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day

229
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:04,160
runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures it is the same life that shoots in joy

230
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:11,359
through the dust of the earth in numberless blades of grass and breaks into tumultuous waves of

231
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:16,960
leaves and flowers it is the same life that is rocked

232
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,180
in the ocean cradle of birth and of death in ebb and in flow

233
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:29,359
[Music] i feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life

234
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:38,359
and my pride is from the life throb of ages dancing in my blood this moment

235
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:46,960
i invite you on this day to feel your earthiness

236
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,040
feel your contact with the ground

237
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,119
feel the abundance and aliveness of being earth walking on earth

238
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:04,960
of earth breathing of belonging

239
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,838
of you are earth belonging to earth
