1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,720
so hello everyone hello and welcome to this edition of happy

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:16,160
hour so so for today's practice I want to invite us to

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,760
um yeah to embrace Embrace

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,679
um where meta where compassion is easiest where it's

5
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:37,360
easiest and and um for some it's easiest to start with someone

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,320
we care about that's where it's easiest that's where U it's simpler and then we

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,680
can turn it to ourselves and one reason for um turning

8
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:57,160
to where it's easiest is you know with meta you don't want to fight against it you want to find a way that's really

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,120
easy and wholesome and nourishing and and your whole heart and body and mind

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,439
can be suffused with it and sometimes when we start practicing with ourselves

11
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:16,479
there might be some edges there might be some nooks and crannies that are like nope not quite I'm not ready to love all

12
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,520
those parts yet so it's okay it's all right it's okay we take it gently we

13
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:29,680
turn we warm up the The Meta um through someone else who's

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:37,399
really really really easy to to have metaphor um and then we as after it's

15
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:43,159
been warmed up then we we turn it towards ourselves and and one reason why

16
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:51,640
I'm bringing this in right now especially with everything that's going on in our world in our um politically

17
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,079
Etc is is taking Refuge where it's easy

18
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:03,600
where it's nourishing really where it's easy and nourishing for for your own

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,440
heart no matter which side you're on what you're thinking it's just we're all tired and oh there's just so much going

20
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,800
on so so going back back to the basics nourishing the heart um through care

21
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:27,239
through love um and common humanity is is um feels feels right so so that's the

22
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,080
invitation for today's practice you're welcome to sit if you want to lie down

23
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,360
you can do that too um as long as you're not going to fall asleep if you know

24
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:45,080
you're going to fall asleep don't lie down and I think that's all I need to

25
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:55,000
say right now yeah so um yeah so let's begin let's begin let's

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,480
begin arriving arriving in our bodies

27
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,200
arriving arriving this moment this moment embracing this moment

28
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,920
fully however it's showing up this body however it's showing up in this

29
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:21,280
moment inviting the body to relax

30
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,360
settle to feel our feet on the Earth

31
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:42,799
to feel our sit bones to sense our sit Bones on the chair on the

32
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,599
cushion and our hands touching one

33
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,079
another inviting ourselves to spend some

34
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:00,400
time with the length the entirety of the in breath

35
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,000

36
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,519
breath Letting Go softening

37
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,360

38
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
breath e

39
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,280
and if the mind is wondering here and there still engaged with what was

40
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:37,479
happening before this sit noticing with a smile the stories

41
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:44,440
the thoughts and inviting your dear heart your dear mind to put it down thank you

42
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:52,039

43
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:56,759
down and give our heart to this practice

44
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:08,680
settling more deeply Letting Go relaxing more of the

45
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,599
body with each breath with each out breath

46
00:06:52,599 --> 00:07:01,520
now I like to invite each of us to bring into our heart space invite

47
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:11,160
someone for whom our care our meta flows with ease there's

48
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,599
no complication in the

49
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:25,120
relationship babies are really good for this category babies

50
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,000
children grandchildren pets

51
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,039
and if your children are now adults when they were babies

52
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,720
young friends and loved ones are good as long as there is no complication in the

53
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,720
relationship

54
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,770
you can borrow nieces nephews when they were

55
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:18,680
[Music] young bring this being bring this

56
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:25,360
being to your heart's mind your heart's space

57
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:40,320
and if you're going through the Rolodex of your mind to find the perfect being it's okay to settle on

58
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:48,560
one and also might be some baby child or pet you don't know

59
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:56,040
very personally that's okay too but the being that conjures up just

60
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:02,519
brings joy happiness meta warmth

61
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,880
Goodwill bring this being to your heart's

62
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,240
mind either if you're visual seeing them

63
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,160
your auditory hearing them

64
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:38,920
feeling them as many senses as you can use to bring a felt sense of this

65
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:53,519
being it's a baby perhaps how soft and cuddly they are how they

66
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:03,120
smell it's a pet maybe how it feels or it felt at some

67
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:09,720
point to stroke them hold

68
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:21,279
them play with them spend some

69
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,800
time connecting really connecting with the felt sense

70
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,680
as you connect with the felt sense as many sense do as available you can

71
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,680
conjure up then bring attention to what comes

72
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,519
up in your heart space in your mind in your

73
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:20,320
body as you feel into this being this

74
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:29,360
beingness for me I notice a smile comes up sense a warmth in my heart center

75
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:41,079
connecting with how sweet and cute my friend's baby is wishing them well

76
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:49,959
wishing her happiness just naturally blows out I want this baby to be

77
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:56,360
happy to keep giggling being a source of

78
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,480
Joy it's being happy in her being a

79
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:09,320
baby and see for you it naturally comes up this is meta it's not so

80
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:20,199
complicated it might be very [Music] gentle that's okay might be big that's

81
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:27,399
fine there may not be so much sensed but the feeling that you're planting

82
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:35,800
seeds and that's great too hang in there doesn't have to feel a particular

83
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,040
way keep connecting with the beingness as

84
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:54,079
multi-dimensionally as possible your body and your memory your felt sense as if they're right here

85
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,000
Conjuring them up

86
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:08,519
that's the first aspect the second which naturally arises from connecting with

87
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:13,639
them is this Sensations in the Heart

88
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:20,040
Center perhaps Goodwill meta that naturally arises in

89
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,760
the heart and if you like you can add

90
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,120
phrases as the third support as the third wheel

91
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,079

146
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,880
being for whom our care or Goodwill flows with ease there's no

147
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:30,720
complication and um and really trying to connect with

148
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:38,720
their the way they are their beingness is their suchness their beingness how they sound how they feel

149
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,080
how they look just maybe how cuddly they are whatever

150
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,480
this this felted sense of this this being and uh as you connect with it then

151
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,000
notice what comes up in your heart in your mind and so that number one is the

152
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,720
being their beingness the being is the first leg of the stool the second

153
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:08,799
leg is is what arises from connecting with them is the feeling in our hearts which is a tenderness kindness warmth a

154
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:14,279
smile whatever comes up that's number two and from number two we allow phrases

155

Silence with ourselves how do we show up can we show up with awareness with

164
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:24,320
kindness for ourselves for others staying embodied embracing compassion and

165
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:32,360
kindness if there's any internal resistance reaction discomfort can we hold it with kindness both internally

166
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:40,200
externally staying on topic and the topic I wanted to give you tonight is

167
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,519
um as you practiced today with with

168
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:52,200
someone wh for whom um you met to flows with ease what did you find supportive

169
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,639
was there something that you found supportive and by offering in the community what you found suppor if you

170
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:05,639
can support other people again you're not so much saying to instruct them and teach them but just a stone soup you're

171
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:12,880
offering oh yeah this was supportive to me and again um please only share about your own practice don't comment on other

172
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:19,600
pra on other people give them advice no cross talk um and take turns

173
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,679
briefly offer one short nugget let let the next person speak and then the next

174
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:31,120

doing happy hour regularly and tonight especially is the the coming back I to

194
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:48,120
to be reminded to come back to the pet that I was thinking of and that would like became kind of like um a mantra and

195
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,519
uh like a coming back to the breath it was coming back to that space of Love of

196
00:33:53,519 --> 00:34:01,880
something that was not difficult to love and care and and um so I'm really um

197
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:09,118
committed and grateful to be having this uh new new chapter in my life with this

198
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,320
group and I find myself attending pretty regularly now so there's something

199
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,280

200
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:26,200
you for sharing this um I'm hearing that you're noticing something is happening a

201
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:34,599
shift is happening which which is why you're showing up there's a shift happening and and um all U and also what

202
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:40,720
you noted with coming back the same way that in um some practices for example in

203
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:48,200
vasana you know we keep going back to the breath as the anchor here going back to the being that being is the anchor we

204
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:54,440
keep going back and in that that being brings up the meta and and the phrases

205
00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:01,359
flow out of that so having that anchor that's oh yeah it's clicking things are clicking for you which is which is just

206
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:08,400
lovely and you're seeing changes in your life yay lovely thanks Isabelle it's

207
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,640
awesome uh

208
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:20,880
Amy uh so tonight I was having actually I was having difficulty I was noticing

209
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,359
like an inner critic thoughts saying like well do you actually feel

210
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:31,720
compassionate to them or you actually you're not that actually that loving like you you're going to find a problem

211
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:37,200
with everybody everything no matter what and and every time I cut I was like well

212
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:45,839
let me try something a little more simple let me try this and it was everything felt sticky um and so I kind of just gave

213
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:51,079
myself like I even though I didn't feel it in Heart Like body way I was like

214
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:57,640
trying to you know give myself some compassion like okay right now the brain is doing this it's like this yeah and

215
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:05,720
then I moved to the breath a little bit just to just to have something else that was a focus nice nice nice beautiful

216
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:11,000
thanks for sharing Amy I really appreciate the wisdom of okay

217
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,280
I'm I'm the one who's hurting right now and the mind and also I appreciate how how you yeah the mind is doing this

218
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,680
right now okay the mind is feeling a little critical right now

219
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:31,760
okay dear mind all right sweetheart okay it's okay it's all right turning instead of really trying to to beat beat oneself

220
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,400
up like okay this is what's happening right now the realization of that accepting it and then the appropriate

221
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:44,079
response which is compassion for yourself great perfect and and another

222
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:51,200
um option I also want to suggest to you sometimes is sometimes it might actually be very helpful maybe tonight this

223
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,200
wouldn't have worked either but I'll just say it is um sometimes when the mind is very

224
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,760
critical people whom we know and near and dear than the mind can be critical

225
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,160
but you can go to maybe you've seen a a I don't know a video of a of a kid of a

226
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:15,920
kitty on the web like right it's it's almost like the neutral person because it's so removed it's like it's a kitty

227
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:23,880
it's like how can you find fault with a kitty like just a cute kitty you can wish well for that unknown Kitty in that

228
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:31,000
cat video so that sometimes could be helpful as well well I don't again night might not

229
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,560
happen but just so so you know that it's in yeah that feels like just picturing it now is you know brings a smile to my

230
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,880
face so I feel like there's a flow of something different just even yeah picturing you know an animal bunch of

231
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:50,359
little baby animals exactly bunch of little chicks oh my goodness when I was growing up I used to have chicks and it

232
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:55,480
was just like oh just seeing an image of a chick just my heart is happy they're

233
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:05,400
so cute and cuddly so yeah have at it yeah great thanks

234
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:12,720
Amy and Jerry first of all thanks for the

235
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:20,480
direction of the beginning Nick and I'm sorry I was a bit delayed com from work but um oh good so I was thinking about

236
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,240
this that it does help to in terms of the practice in terms of what makes it

237
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:32,920
easier or more focus it does help the pick an easy person that's for sure like

238
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:41,960
uh that's doesn't uh that you don't have a sense of uh some St uh strain with but

239
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:48,640
the effect of it though is um quite powerful because it gives the me a sense

240
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:55,280
of enhances not all not all of it but is where I get it but it enhances a sense

241
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:01,079
of purpose a sense of belong longing and a sense of security so fundamental

242
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:07,720
issues in terms of psychological Wellness uh to be able to sort of and so

243
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:16,680
you feel this shift in your body and you think this is this is this is where I want to be and now listen I get tired I

244
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:23,280
get lonely I get angry I could not but in the state that I was thinking when you asked the question uh how do you

245
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:31,040
enhance the practice or how do it help the practice but also the downstream effect it's quite anchoring so thank

246
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:40,040
you thank you Jerry well well put well put um and and knowing

247
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:45,240
that you you have expertise and and um a

248
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:52,520
lot of knowledge in this area as you're talking about you know the the really the psychological resourcing that this

249
00:39:52,520 --> 00:40:01,119
kind of practice can allow in ways that really expand to bring more um more

250
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,200
physical stability and and and uh regulation and and the heart and mind

251
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,720
and yeah so many benefits and so easy right so it seems straightforward like

252
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:20,560
yeah we all can conjure up some being that's cute and cuddly and lovable and just give him love in our hearts and oh

253
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,599
guess what I feel better I don't feel as anxious or angry or upset or exhausted

254
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:33,079
that I did 30 minutes ago wow I feel better and gosh my heart feels more open

255
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:38,200
to myself to others oh that's the the

256
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:45,640
wild amazing thing that happens with these um precious practices yeah thanks

Jerry you

258
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,760
Claire thank you having a lot of video problems tonight I just wanted to add

259
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:03,520
because I don't think anybody mentioned it that several people in our group talked along exactly the same lines you

260
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:09,520
were just speaking about of animals and pets and the nurturing that they provide

261
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:16,000
us yeah yeah indeed which is exactly what you were saying right absolutely

262
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,160
yeah yeah thank you Claire yeah very important it's unconditional love and

263
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,560
it's yeah very nourishing thanks for highlighting that

264
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,160
Peggy hi um in initially I had some a

265
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:42,560
little bit of lamenting that I I had trouble finding someone that I had unconditional love for um but

266
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:50,040
I did manage and but what's interesting is I was a little sad about that starting off and now it's like that love

267
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:55,400
is in my heart without needing an object like just that

268
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:03,400
feeling so it's it's really nice and um thank you just kind of for everyone a that's lovely thank you piggy

269
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,599
thanks for sharing that's um yeah I so appreciate the

270
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:14,079
progression that you shared and that most importantly that you stuck with it

271
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:20,520
you know maybe that feeling comes up like oh I can't find anyone H going through the Rolodex which is very old

272
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:26,680
school but any going through my contact list ah um and and then hanging in there

273
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:33,839
and keep practicing as best as you're able to and then realizing actually wait there's a lot of love in my heart wow

274
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:40,760
it's our it's it's here it's already here it's here in in ways that so so hanging in there with the practice

275
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,800
allowed this this burgeoning this this shift instead of staying in there so I

276
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,839
really want to reflect that back thank you thank you thanks Peggy this is so
