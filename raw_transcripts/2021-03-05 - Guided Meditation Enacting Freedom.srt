1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:09,120
so welcome to this meditation session

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,240
and a valuable perspective on mindfulness meditation

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,720
is that it is the enactment of freedom

4
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:34,160
where expressing in in mental action our capacity to be free

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:43,680
so when we decide to be mindful of something something as simple as mindful of the breathing we are making a choice

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:51,760
when the mind wanders off in thought and you're mindful enough to and

7
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,600
choose to be mindful rather than wandering off in thought when you're mindful enough to choose

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,320
beginning again with your breathing that's an expression of freedom to

9
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,400
choose what often happens is that

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,840
we will what comes along with that choice and which obscures the freedom is ideas

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,320
that i didn't do it well enough i need to do it better i should try harder i should

12
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,000
strain push make more effort all these other you know that i'm a

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,960
lousy meditator or someone else is doing it better than me or the real thing is something different

14
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,079
and all these ideas and all these get carried along and all these shoulds

15
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,479
get carried along and obscures the fact that for one little moment

16
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:59,119
there was an ex an enactment of freedom the freedom to of where our attention

17
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,360
can be focused and uh and we and so to appreciate that

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,920
moment that initial moment that moment that's independent and free of all the thoughts

19
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,760
agendas fears that we might have all the ideas of self

20
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,599
that kind of come along with it obscures the fact that we have just

21
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,959
enacted a small little moment of freedom

22
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,480
and if then we choose to investigate to explore to look

23
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,239
more closely at the experience there also

24
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:52,400
it's an enactment of freedom it's a freedom from our preoccupations

25
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,519
from all our judgments and reactivity

26
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,120
so to be first to be mindful is a little freedom from preoccupation from being

27
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,159
pulled into a world where we're trapped or not free

28
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:16,640
of thoughts ideas fantasies judgments just simple be mindful of this

29
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,560
that freedom is enacted a little bit more strongly in the initial moment we decide to look

30
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,840
more carefully and that's often obscured the freedom because

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,680
we think that we have to be successful there's it's a it's an exam and we're going to get it

32
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,480
tested if we you know how well we discover what we're going to what's there and there's some magic key that we have to

33
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,720
see and and i have to really strain now and look and analyze and

34
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,640
all these other ideas that obscure the simplicity of the moment of looking

35
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,840
more carefully looking what is this that's an enactment of

36
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:06,799
freedom and as we see more clearly the choices we make become

37
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,799
an enactment of freedom the choice not to strain as we look at our

38
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:20,400
breathing as we meditate on breathing the choice to

39
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:29,280
turn our attention from the breath to look at how we're being critical of ourselves

40
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,800
in the criticalness lost in that there's no freedom but in the moment of turning around to

41
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,160
look at it a choice to look at it rather than just going along with it is also an

42
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,199
enactment of freedom to see what is helpful and not helpful

43
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:57,840
healthy and not healthy and to choose the healthy is an enactment of freedom

44
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,400
and so to begin appreciating no the little hints the little hints of freedom

45
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,560
in mindfulness investigation in effort

46
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:23,120
and as we appreciate it we can that appreciation

47
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,560
is a pleasure that appreciation can be

48
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:36,160
can give rise to a contentment oh this is the path to freedom

49
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,280
i'm on a good i'm discovering something helpful here

50
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:50,479
they can give rise to joy the joy of freely

51
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,840
being aware of our experience

52
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,880
and then there can be even affection for the difficult things because we're

53
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,840
aware of them with our freedom

54
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,000
so as these seven factors of awakening develop first they develop as little hints

55
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,759
little as little intuitions of how they're there but as we do this meditation perhaps you

56
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:31,199
can sit here now with an intuition the hints a recognition

57
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:41,440
of how you enact freedom in choosing to be mindful investigate

58
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,919
make effort and the freedom that's found before all

59
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:55,199
the complexities we bring to those things in their simplicity

60
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,039
so to sit to assume your meditation posture

61
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:10,319
and some of you probably didn't recognize that in assuming your posture you were expressing your freedom

62
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,520
there is a choice free will choice to now adjust your posture

63
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,319
take a posture

64
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,840
and then to gently close your eyes

65
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,960
and as you're sitting here with the eyes closed

66
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,400
what is the simplest freest way that you can allow yourself to be aware

67
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,120
of your body

68
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,560
a choice a free will choice if you want to take it

69
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,198
to become aware of how your body is right now

70
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,840
before preferences before likes and dislikes

71
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:26,400
just aware

72
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:33,520
and then to take a few long slow deep breaths

73
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,839
as you exhale relax into the posture

74
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:50,640
deep breath in exhale relax the whole body as if the posture

75
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,320
relaxing is a homecoming to this posture

76
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,680
and then letting your breathing return to normal

77
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,200
and as you exhale softening the muscles of your forehead

78
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:29,519
and temple and if they don't soften or relax

79
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,839
maybe you can the awareness of it can be spacious and open

80
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,839
as you exhale softening around the eyes

81
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,800
the cheeks

82
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,839
the jaws

83
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,000
as you exhale maybe there can be a relaxation and

84
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,640
opening in this the back of your neck

85
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:33,839
the vertebrae just below the skull can they soften and relax

86
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,800
softening as you exhale around the

87
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
collarbones

88
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:01,839
and then releasing the shoulders

89
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,320
as you exhale relaxing the chest

90
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:29,839
the heart center

91
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,839
and then softening the belly

92
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,839
in the lower half of your torso

93
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:11,519
lower back the hip area hip joints

94
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:25,839
and down your legs

95
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,279
and then gently calmly

96
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,160
become mindful of your breathing

97
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,920
and can you as you're mindful of breathing

98
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,519
feel or perceive how the choice to do so

99
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:03,519
if it's your own is it small little enactment of freedom

100
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,240
freedom from the tyranny of thinking

101
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:21,839
just mindful for a moment

102
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:47,600
receptive to the inhalation receptive to the movements of the body

103
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,480
as you breathe in

104
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,079
and is there some way that that simple receptive awareness

105
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:09,040
have qualities of freedom independence

106
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:21,839
for a few moments maybe awareness free of being hijacked by thoughts and

107
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,240
ideas and judgments

108
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:45,839
simple awareness receptive to breathing

109
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:55,600
as you exhale allowing the exhale and allowing awareness

110
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,440
is there some freedom and awareness that is so simple it just allows the

111
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,160
experience to be there

112
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,839
even if you are thinking and judging

113
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:22,399
maybe part of the awareness of breathing can feel like there's freedom there

114
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:41,839
a silent freedom spacious open

115
00:15:51,680 --> 00:16:00,079
and very gently exploring the experience of breathing

116
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:09,839
feeling it more fully more clearly not dramatically so just a little more

117
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,000
and in that choice to explore and feel it more fully

118
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,279
there's also an enactment of freedom

119
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:37,839
enactment to be aware rather than being pulled into thinking

120
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:10,000
and if you find yourself thinking and you choose to begin again with your

121
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,558
breathing

122
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,400
that's an enactment of effort which might also contain

123
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:33,840
some freedom freedom of choice freedom of where your effort is placed

124
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,760
if while you're inhaling you choose to be with the inhale

125
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:09,760
but then when you exhale the choice becomes to be with the exhale

126
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,840
it's a simple enactment of liberated

127
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
effort

128
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,679
into whatever degree however small

129
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,320
you can feel that your practice enacts

130
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,160
freedom even if you keep getting caught and

131
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,279
thought and preoccupied in it

132
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,840
even so is there some little corner of awareness

133
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:07,200
of effort will you feel your freedom

134
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:14,799
and to appreciate that to feel the pleasure of that

135
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,880
maybe even the joy of that

136
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:39,440
appreciating our freedom is also an enactment of freedom

137
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,320
feeling the joy

138
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,480
of liberated mindfulness

139
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,240
and then it doesn't matter so much what we're mindful of

140
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:13,280
because we delight in mindfulness itself

141
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:21,360
we delight in investigation there's a delight in this effort or

142
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:31,840
choice that has qualities of freedom in it

143
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,400
and there's freedom in enjoying

144
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,559
the joy of freedom as we practice mindfulness

145
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:53,600
no matter what we're mindful of there can be a delight

146
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,840
in that freedom

147
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:22,640
if you find yourself caught up in thought or caught up in anything

148
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,640
if you allow yourself to clearly know that that's the case

149
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:39,840
there is some quality of freedom in that clear knowing

150
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:49,039
see if you can build on that freedom expand that freedom

151
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,840
by doing it again and again

152
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,840
in the last 10 minutes of this sitting perhaps you can feel your way

153
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,799
to stay close to where you're free

154
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:42,399
the freedom which is closely related to simplicity of being

155
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,919
nothing complicated

156
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:59,120
recognizing the simple freedom in choosing to be

157
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:13,679
aware this simple freedom and seeing what's

158
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:26,480
happening the freedom to en to appreciate to enjoy

159
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:34,800
the simplicity of being that's related

160
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:49,839
to our freedom

161
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,640
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

162
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:05,279
imagine what it's like for what would be like for you

163
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,800
to be resting in the simplicity of being

164
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,839
resting in a freedom of being

165
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,920
where you're not caught up in your reactions your judgments your criticalness

166
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:34,560
not cut up in the shoulds and shouldn'ts sense of obligations and

167
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:42,560
just resting in simple freedom where you're allowed to be free you're

168
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,720
allowed to be simple and present

169
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,000
and in this way imagine that you encounter another person

170
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,720
who's also free a person who has no agendas and

171
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,599
has no needs at the moment

172
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:13,839
is not living in their judgments or preferences likes and dislikes

173
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:21,280
this person is also at rest at ease in their own simplicity of being

174
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:27,839
at ease in their freedom

175
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:37,680
and to sit with this person you and your freedom and they and their

176
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,839
freedom

177
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:55,520
freedom where it makes it safe to have good will love

178
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:02,800
care friendliness for the other

179
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:12,318
and perhaps you can open your heart safely fully

180
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:20,720
a meeting of hearts each of you independent and free

181
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:27,839
without any need from the other content and to sit with each other

182
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,040
appreciating each other

183
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,480
and how much can you open your heart your good will your friendliness and

184
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:47,200
this circumstance and now imagine that you can do that

185
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,920
with others who are not so free people who come with agendas and

186
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,359
preferences and needs imagine that you can rest in your

187
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:05,838
simplicity of being even then

188
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,960
and without them necessarily knowing

189
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:18,960
to continue with your good will your friendliness

190
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,119
choosing freely choosing

191
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:36,160
goodwill and may it be that we learn

192
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:45,359
through this practice to open our good will to all beings

193
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:52,480
equally while being rooted in our capacity for

194
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,599
freedom freedom that allows us to return to a

195
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,839
simplicity of being

196
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:12,640
so that we might genuinely feel and think may it be that all beings be happy

197
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,880
may it be that all beings be safe

198
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:29,839
may it be that all beings be peaceful

199
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:35,680
may it be that all beings be free

200
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:45,040
and may i in my capacity for freedom

201
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:54,000
help make this possible at least radiating for me

202
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:02,160
comes good will and safety for others

203
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:11,838

204
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,319
