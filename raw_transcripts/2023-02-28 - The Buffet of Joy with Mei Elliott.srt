1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:08,639
good evening everyone welcome it's nice to be here with you

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,759
my name is May Elliott and I'm coming today from San Francisco

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,760
Zen Center where I live and work and I serve as director there

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,580
um and I spent a lot of time sitting vipassana despite living at a Zen Center

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,420
so I love this tradition and I'm very glad to be here if at any point in the talk you can't

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,920
hear me just do this and I'll raise my voice a bit so I wanted to start with a very short

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,840
poem about two very large beings by the great Sufi poet Rumi

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,039
and his title for the poem is two giant fat people

9
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,140
and it goes like this God and I have become like two giant fat

10
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,740
people living in a tiny boat we keep bumping into each other and

11
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,040
laughing I'll read it again God and I have become like two giant fat

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,439
people living in a tiny boat we keep bumping into each other and

13
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:26,280
laughing so some of you may be familiar with hote

14
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:34,020
sometimes known as The Laughing Buddha you might have seen sculptures of him sometimes in gardens and he's typically

15
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,960
depicted as having this big belly and a huge smile sometimes his hands are up

16
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,540
like this above his head sometimes kind of rest in a resting posture

17
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,860
um and as it turns out hote is actually the depiction of a an old Chinese monk

18
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,740
um and as Legend has it hote was known for

19
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,540
being so large because he would eat the suffering of others

20
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:13,200
so he had this big belly because he consumed other people's problems all the

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,800
while being full of joy so when I hear Rumi's poem what I see

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,920
are two Hotes sitting in a tiny boat floating on the

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,340
ocean of suffering bumping into each other and having a great time

24
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:40,020
and what I love about hote is he is that he shows us that that Joy

25
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:47,879
helps us metabolize suffering right if we want to be resilient enough to

26
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:54,660
face our own suffering we need some joy and if we want to be in service to

27
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:02,459
others if we want to meet the crises of gun violence or of racism or of deadly

28
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:11,060
earthquakes then we need to be pretty well resourced and joy helps us be well resourced

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,200
so that's what I'd like to talk about tonight Joy the practice of joy and specifically

30
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,760
I'm calling this talk the buffet of joy cultivating wholesome States

31
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:41,040
so uh considering so much of human life is spent trying to obtain joy and avoid

32
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,239
unpleasant experiences it's kind of surprising that we don't talk about it more directly and more frequently so I

33
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,420
became really interested in what does Buddhism have to say about Joy and what

34
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:01,440
are reliable means of cultivating it and can Joy be available when circumstances

35
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,319
are unfavorable and this is a relevant topic for me

36
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:15,120
because I've spent much of the past 15 years being really serious about

37
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:23,360
practice and there have been many parts of that time where

38
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,020
the practice was not about Joy it was about suffering and renunciation and

39
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,280
getting rid of my hobbies so I could meditate and sacrificing time with loved

40
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,000
ones for Retreats and all of that has been a really powerful training

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,900
and I've learned over time that it's severely underemphasized Joy

42
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:55,800
um and it's taken me a long time to realize that cultivating Joy is a tremendously important part of the

43
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,840
spiritual path um yeah Joy is not an add-on some people

44
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,800
feel like suffering the meat of practice enjoys an accessory but that's actually not the case like there's there's a

45
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,560
reason that the Buddha was known as the happy one

46
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:21,180
and joy is found all over the place in the Buddhist teachings so you know if you're a list person you might know that

47
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:29,039
you can find it in the seven factors of Awakening and in the 16 steps upon upon asati it's

48
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,500
in Transcendent dependent arising sympathetic joys of Brahma vihara so

49
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:41,520
it's all over the place you don't have to go far to find it um James bear is the Insight teacher

50
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,680
who's probably best known for his teachings on Joy he actually wrote a

51
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,560
book called Awakening Joy so if you want a little more joy in your life that's a good one

52
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,080
um he says gladness and Delight do not merely

53
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,500
balance out negative Tendencies they actually heal the aversive mind

54
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,600
I love that gladness and Delight don't merely balance out negative Tendencies

55
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:17,100
they actually heal the aversive mind so one of the ways that I've learned to

56
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:23,039
attune to Joy is by getting to know the different flavors of Joy kind of in the

57
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:29,240
same way that one might be a connoisseur of fine cheeses

58
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:36,780
one can also be a connoisseur of Joy so here's here's a quote from the dhamapata

59
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:43,919
tasting the flavor of solitude and peace one becomes free of distress and Evil

60
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,880
drinking the flavor of Dharma Joy ah so happily we live we who have no

61
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,979
attachments we shall Feast on joy as the radiant gods

62
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,139
sounds pretty good right so I'm using joy as a more general term

63
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:09,620
tonight just to Encompass all of these wholesome States kind of a catch-all term

64
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,000
but they're actually like very precise distinctions in the sutas about the

65
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,120
different flavors of joy and there's a set of teachings that's locally known as the gladness pentad

66
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,440
that actually goes through some of these flavors so I'm going to share them with

67
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,780
you in the way that you're sometimes getting to to hear distinctions helps

68
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:39,900
wake us up to see those distinctions in our own life and to be more more attuned to them so

69
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,960
um the five parts of the gladness pentad there's gladness pamoja is the first

70
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,099
then PT Joy Tranquility pasadi

71
00:07:52,099 --> 00:08:00,199
happiness or sukkah and concentration or samadhi so gladness Joy Tranquility

72
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,639
happiness and concentration so in the sutus this is presented as

73
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:12,180
something that can naturally arise in the heart and can they unfold from one to the next to the next so it's kind of

74
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,960
sequential um and so let's zoom in now on a couple of

75
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,139
these because it seems a lot like gladness joy and happiness like those

76
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:31,680
seem like they'd be synonymous but they're actually not Tranquility I'd say most people are familiar Tranquility has

77
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,520
a slightly different flavor you know calm or concentration or the stealing of the Mind the collecting of the mind but

78
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:44,760
those three that I just named they seem pretty similar so those are the ones that I'll unpack for you so

79
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,240
the first gladness or pomoja [Music]

80
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,580
this state is more actually more evaluative in nature so that's to say

81
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:03,420
there's often it's often evoked by a mental catalyst um like I'm glad about something so

82
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:10,019
gladness arises when we evaluate a situation it might happen in a split second and we go oh this is pretty great

83
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:17,760
you know and often gratitude has this Quality quality of gladness because it

84
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:25,080
comes from reflection like oh I'm so glad that that meeting at work went well today or oh I'm so glad that I have this

85
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:32,220
cozy blanket for my my bed so it's it has a mental Catalyst for it

86
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:38,820
Joy PT on the other hand the next factor in the gladness pentad does not rely on

87
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:45,500
a mental catalyst so it doesn't need any sort of mental stimulus for it to happen

88
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:52,440
instead it's more physical very energized uplifting and often it

89
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,600
comes forth from wholehearted engagement in activity So like

90
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,920
um so meditative Joy or PT sometimes it's even translated as Rapture because as

91
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,320
the mind really begins to collect a lot of energy and joy can come forth

92
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,160
physically in the body so um then we have tranquility and then

93
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:23,160
happiness so happiness is considered the most subtle of the three

94
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:30,060
um it's more subdued relaxed calm satiated

95
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:36,240
um so uh contented and it happens as we continue to become

96
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:43,080
more collected more immersed in in wholehearted engagement with the task at

97
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:49,079
hand and then concentration so those are the five

98
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:56,240
um but to share maybe an analogy for those three the three really similar ones

99
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,600
there's an analogy in the commentaries to the abidama that does a nice job of just describing

100
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,540
how joy and happiness are different and I think it actually I'll add in a

101
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:17,339
way that it also explains gladness too so imagine for a moment that you are out in

102
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:23,940
a desert and you are parched it's been a long time since you've had anything to drink

103
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:31,320
um and uh you happen to hear from someone that there's an oasis nearby

104
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,260
so you can imagine that upon hearing this news the Mind becomes very glad

105
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:44,279
it's really glad about the fact that there's an oasis there like there's that gladdening in the heart

106
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:49,380
when actually starting to travel to the Oasis you can imagine there's a lot of

107
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,800
energy and excitement and joy so that's that's how it is going to the Oasis

108
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,920
once you get to the Oasis and you drink water to your heart's content and you

109
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,019
bathe in the waters and there's birds and lotuses and you rest back in the

110
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:12,660
shade and you're satiated and content that is sukkah

111
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:20,459
so PT is the excitement of going to the Oasis and sukkah is that satiation

112
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:26,519
thirst quenched so these are the three flavors of Dharma

113
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,920
Joy so hopefully you can just start to feel into those in your own life and

114
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,339
practice so you can develop a palette for them

115
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,639
and uh what's so wonderful about them and I mentioned this briefly before is that they they happen naturally they

116
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,639
don't come into being because they are uh they're not they're not willed into being

117
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,700
um by the practitioner but rather the practitioner just puts in place the conditions

118
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:02,399
for the gladness pentad to occur um so we can think about it a little bit

119
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,440
like growing a garden like we're not in charge of when the seed actually Sprouts

120
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,320
right we can we can provide good soil and make sure it's in a place where it

121
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:22,019
has plenty of sunlight and we can water it regularly but we don't control when the seed sprouts and similarly we can

122
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:27,480
put conditions in place for the gladness pentad but we can't we can't force it to

123
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:34,980
happen right so um and what's great about what I like about this analogy of the of a seed

124
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:42,300
growing is when a seed Sprouts you know little seedlings they have the leaves that unfold one and then the other and

125
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:49,860
that's how the gladness pentad can unfold too it can be gladness one leaf then the next leaf on unfurls which a

126
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:57,600
joy then Tranquility Etc um and so our job just create favorable

127
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,700
conditions so uh the next question might be well

128
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:09,540
what are the favorable conditions um and that's what I'd like to spend the rest of the talk discussing is

129
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:16,260
um what are favorable conditions for the arising of the gladness pentad

130
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:21,740
and specifically I want to focus on some lesser known ones I think

131
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,720
all of you probably have some wonderful ways of cultivating joy in your own life

132
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:34,800
people love spending time in nature and with people they care about and they

133
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:41,459
have wonderful hobbies and that is all fabulous and sometimes it can be helpful

134
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:48,839
to have some lesser-known modes of bringing joy into one's life so the three that I'm going

135
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:55,440
to share with you are all noted in the sutas as causes as as conditions for the

136
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,620
arising of the gladness pentad so one is ethical conduct

137
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:10,139
Sila virtue so ethical Behavior uh the next is generosity or Donna

138
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:16,920
and the third is Faith or Sada so ethical conduct generosity and Faith

139
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,019
so I'll spend a little time sharing about each of those um

140
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:28,639
so to start uh virtue ethical conduct this

141
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,680
some of you may have may be familiar with the term the Bliss of blamelessness

142
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:41,399
so this refers to the lightness of being when we're not guilty of causing harm

143
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,860
and when we're not we're not weighed down with the burden of unskillful

144
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:54,899
actions we're not killing or stealing or engaging in sexual misconduct or lying

145
00:15:54,899 --> 00:16:01,560
Etc [Music] um and you might be able to feel into this in your own life and just connecting

146
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:07,079
with the experience of the difference between feeling guilty

147
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:13,519
and non-guilt like like there's uh feeling sneaky is no fun

148
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,860
so those uh states of um yeah of non-guilt

149
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,959
um are are lighter um and it's actually it's very hard for

150
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,660
the mind to settle uh when you've done something unethical like I know people

151
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:37,740
whose meditation has been really haunted by the um unwholesome actions of their

152
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:43,500
past and so it's actually it's a really supportive condition not just for gladness but for the settling of the

153
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:50,100
mind to um to have wholesome uh engage in wholesome

154
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:56,160
activity to um be upright in one's actions

155
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,160
um so at Zen Center some time ago there was

156
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,480
a very Charming new student there who is just starting to take up precept

157
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,760
practice and she was engaging it in her life to try to get a sense of like how

158
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:20,220
um how the precepts were helpful and did they bring forth joy and what's this all

159
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:26,579
about so she told a story about a time that she went to the grocery store

160
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:32,340
she went to the clerk purchased her items and as she was about to leave she

161
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:38,220
realized that the the clerk gave her too much change so she practicing her precepts not

162
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:44,580
taking what's not freely given she went back to oh excuse me you know you I think you gave me more change than you

163
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:51,240
intended handed it back and as she was about to leave

164
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,520
she noticed the person that was next to her in line that was about to to check

165
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,980
out themselves um they just looked astonished

166
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,919
and they said whoa that that just restored my faith in

167
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,380
humanity so this new student they're like wow not

168
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,780
so bad huh restored somebody's faith in humanity like how's that for cultivating

169
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:24,360
Joy so we never know how our upright actions

170
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:30,059
how our sea level impact others and the ways that it'll brighten the heart

171
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:37,620
and there's such a joy in being able to do what what's honest I can think of a few times myself when I was kind of torn

172
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:43,260
between a decision and one just didn't feel quite as ethically upright and in

173
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:49,799
choosing the one that felt cleaner it was like oh just a little Sparkle of

174
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:56,460
gladness arose in the heart so that's that fruiting of the gladness pentat

175
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:02,580
there's a there's a joy of Freedom an inner relaxation uh when we're not in

176
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:11,580
Conflict about the right thing to do so that's number one Silo the second

177
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:19,679
generosity or Donna so generosity comes from I mean it can

178
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:26,820
occur in so many ways material gifts giving time giving attention giving an

179
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,919
apology giving the gift of fearlessness that's talked about in the Buddhist

180
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,960
tradition that actually when we live ethically we're not um

181
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,340
a source of danger for others so so many ways that we can be generous

182
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:51,419
and for me for years I I kept a gratitude list every night and uh

183
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:59,520
in addition to writing down what I was grateful for that day I would also include any gifts that I had given that

184
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,700
day and it might not necessarily be a material gift but you know maybe the gift of my listening or any any gifts

185
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,100
that I gave that day um and I noticed how much it gladdened

186
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:18,000
the mind to recall those at the end of the day and actually to to feel them again

187
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:27,780
um and what I noticed was that if if I was able to give on any given day that was a

188
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:34,500
good day and it became much less important whether that day was pleasant or unpleasant

189
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:41,640
and so you know what if we based our happiness on what we give rather than

190
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,940
what we get a different way of of relating in the world

191
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,980
and if you do give a gift don't miss it

192
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:59,880
so if you give a gift and you feel that little bit of joy in the heart really be

193
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:06,360
present for that don't miss that moment you know um almost like you're a sponge soaking

194
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:12,679
it up really let your mindfulness register what that feels like in the body

195
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:20,460
there's a Native American ceremony where parents give their children an

196
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:26,700
abundance of food and gifts and then they step away and they cry out

197
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:33,480
I'm hungry I'm thirsty and then the children

198
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,840
get to give to them from a place of abundance

199
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:47,000
so that's a training in Donna it's a training in generosity

200
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:55,140
I was reading the news some time ago and I came across a story of generosity

201
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:03,179
about a four-year-old boy named Nolan and Nolan had a rare form of lymphoma

202
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:08,280
and he was in the hospital and Nolan

203
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:13,500
more than anything wanted to be a firefighter

204
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:20,039
and so the local fire department got word of this

205
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:28,260
and they decided to go visit Nolan um as it happens it was during the height

206
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:34,200
of the covid pandemic so they couldn't actually go into his hospital room to

207
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,960
visit him but they did something better they actually

208
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:48,120
drove the fire truck to the hospital and they extended the ladder all the way

209
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,520
up to the fifth floor where they greeted Nolan

210
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:00,000
so you can just imagine what it was like to be that first firefighter up that

211
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,260
ladder to meet that little boy like you might even feel it in your heart now just imagining that so you

212
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:12,539
might even go inside and just connect if you feel any gladness in the heart

213
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:18,360
imagining that and if you do

214
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:25,100
that's the arising of the gladness pentad so that's Joy or that's that's

215
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,780
generosity as a condition for gladness so that's the fruiting of this teaching

216
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,620
in your own heart

217
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,559
okay so the next faith how does faith lead to

218
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:51,120
gladness so I want to note that faith is not a word

219
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,320
that works for everyone

220
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:03,960
for some people the word confidence or trust feels more resonant

221
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,419
um and faith in what of course in the Dharma

222
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:15,299
so faith faith in the Buddha the Dharma and the Sangha you know in our faith in

223
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:21,960
our own capacity for awakening in these teachings in the the Sangha and the

224
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,480
community of spiritual practitioners so so that's the sort of faith that

225
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,760
we're talking about sort of that's the sort of confidence that I'm referencing

226
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:39,840
um and it might be hard to to understand how faith can lead to gladness so one

227
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,419
way that we can think about this is to realize that there's um

228
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:51,179
is that when we yeah when we realize that there's an alternative to suffering

229
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:57,480
that is very good news so to realize that I can actually be

230
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:03,179
free regardless of whether circumstances are favorable like

231
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:10,200
that's very good news you know like who wouldn't be happy when they learned that there's an alternative to suffering

232
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:17,400
so that's that's the thread that takes us um from Faith to gladness like oh there

233
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:25,440
is another way what Joy there's so much joy in that so in order to grow faith it requires

234
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,559
you to expose yourself to the teachings so by coming to this talk tonight you

235
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:37,159
are putting the conditions in place for gladness so your your

236
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:42,480
providing the Sun the soil the water just in doing this

237
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,779
so listening to the Dharma cultivates Faith spending time with Dharma friends

238
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:53,700
cultivates faith studying cultivates faith

239
00:25:53,700 --> 00:26:00,299
so here's an analogy about about faith from James Barris

240
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:07,140
so he says that learning to have faith in the Dharma is a little bit like learning to swim

241
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:13,919
so you know at first we get in the pool and we're kind of thrashing around and doggy paddling and

242
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,559
um don't feel so supported um we're a little out of control we don't

243
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:25,679
trust the water to hold us yet um but as we spend some more time in the

244
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,720
pool we might learn to tread water a bit we start to trust that the waters

245
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:37,320
starting to hold us a little bit more so this is like when we we start to practice and we start to gain a little

246
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:44,580
trust in the teachings we see okay this is working a bit I'm starting to have a little bit of confidence here

247
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:50,159
and then over time as we continue to practice our faith

248
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:56,340
becomes verified our faith can become radiant we really trust the Dharma

249
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:02,039
and that's that's like when we learn that we can just lay back on the water

250
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:10,039
and float and that the Dharma can support us and that it was there to hold us all along

251
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:21,299
so it's a joyful experience to go from frantically doggy paddling to resting on

252
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:27,600
the surface of the water fully supported so that's the joy that's the gladness

253
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:34,500
that can become possible when we have faith when we have confidence in the teachings

254
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:42,260
so just like two people in a boat floating on the ocean of suffering

255
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:47,340
bumping into each other and laughing right

256
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:53,520
so when we put the appropriate conditions in place

257
00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:00,480
uh when we provide conditions like virtue

258
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,659
generosity faith we create those conditions for

259
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:12,020
gladness that's our soil our sunlight our water so

260
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:19,860
so try these out in your life you probably already are and you might

261
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:26,880
just see the relationship between those activities and gladness between those

262
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:35,460
activities and joy so in doing so may you taste all of the

263
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:41,460
flavors of Dharma Joy experiencing the full Buffet

264
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,679
so I'll close with a poem and this is by

265
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:53,658
Mary's standing otter it's very joyful poem

266
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,980
right now there are Tibetan Buddhist monks in a

267
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:06,539
temple in the Himalayas endlessly reciting mantras for the cessation of your suffering and for the

268
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:13,320
flourishing of your happiness someone you haven't met yet is already

269

dreaming of adoring you someone is writing a book that you will

270
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:27,480

271
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,600
praying for the Holy Spirit to alight the heart of all of God's children

272
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,398
a farmer is looking at his organic crops and Whispering nourish them

273
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:46,740
someone wants to kiss you to hold you to make tea for you

274
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:53,520
someone is willing to lend you money wants to know what your favorite food is and treat you to a movie

275
00:29:53,520 --> 00:30:00,240
someone in your orbit has something immensely valuable to give you for free

276
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:09,059
something is being invented this year that will change how your generation lives communicates heals and passes on

277
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:14,419
the next great song is being rehearsed

278
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:20,760
thousands of people are in yoga classes right now intentionally sending light

279
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:27,240
out from their heart chakras and wrapping it around the Earth millions of children are assuming that

280
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,419
everything is amazing and will always be that way

281
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:40,080
someone is in profound pain and a few months from now they'll be thriving like

282
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,880
never before from where they are they just can't see it

283
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:54,659
someone has recently cracked open their joyous genuine nature because they did the hard

284
00:30:54,659 --> 00:31:01,260
work of hauling years of Oppression off of their psyche this luminous Juju is floating in The

285

thank you all for your kind attention

293
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:50,820
so we have a little time now for any questions or comments

294
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,200
any reflections

295
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:12,720
maybe anything about your own practice of joy or your own reflection on these topics

296
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:20,220
that's welcome also and your comments don't have to be genius

297
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:28,019
sometimes I think that's when in a group there's this sense that like if we say something it has to be genius

298
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:34,320
it's not true and just say your name before you speak

299
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:42,600
if you don't mind Mike so you distinguishes three things in the

300
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:48,240
pentad how would you distinguish Tranquility from concentration sure yeah

301
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,640
so um they both feed each other so often

302
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:59,659
they're occurring at the same time that's a really good question because often

303
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:05,340
concentration brings forth tranquility and tranquility

304
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:13,080
feeds concentration right so um I would describe so Tranquility or

305
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:19,200
passati is really that state of calm and it can be both physical there can be

306
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,720
physical tranquility and there can also be mental tranquility but they don't necessarily need to

307
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:31,980
happen at the same time so there's been times where I've had a lot of physical Tranquility but the mind

308
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:38,220
was not all that tranquil like you may have had the experience of having a really good day of exercise and the body

309
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:45,658
is so calm in the evening but the mind it's not concentrated so that might be a

310
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:54,480
difference and there's times where the mind has had the mind has felt somewhat tranquil

311
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,839
um but it's not that it's not particularly concentrated or focused like it's not it's not very collected

312
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:07,260
necessarily like it has like a subdued quality but it's it's

313
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:12,359
[Music] um yeah it's not necessarily collected like it might have some kind of like frayed

314
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:20,760
strayed thoughts whereas concentration it has concentration is the collecting of the

315
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:28,260
mind you know it's when the Mind collects into the present moment and it's willing to rest on whatever object

316
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:34,079
we put it on right so it's it's very well behaved

317
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:42,300
um and so often there's a reason that concentration meditations they're often

318
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:48,260
called the shamata or samata which means calm abiding because they're so

319
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:54,720
interlinked that those meditations bring forth calm so concentration quite

320
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,078
naturally brings that forth yeah great question

321
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:15,680
um one of the things that you said May about

322
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:22,619
floating floating on your back in the water it's triggered a memory that I had when

323
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:28,440
I was a kid I was actually very very skinny and my swimming teachers would

324
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:34,200
tell me all you have to do is float on your back move your head back

325
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,599
and you'll float and I didn't I I could never float on my

326
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:45,960
back and it was hard not to take that personally like there was some

327
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:54,599
you know like I should be able to float on the water and it wasn't until I was much older and

328
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:00,900
somewhat more rotund that floating came naturally but at that point it just so

329
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:06,839
it made me think sometimes do you have any thoughts about how does

330
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:15,119
one develop that trust to float when it just doesn't seem possible right

331
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:22,680
right well when you're a kid maybe you just needed to eat more suffering like hote

332
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:28,619
hot belly so um yeah

333
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:34,079
one of the five hindrances is doubt doubt is like one of the most common

334
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:43,099
things that plagues the mind and the antidote to doubt is faith so it's really really helpful to to

335
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:50,280
find a way to answer the question that you're asking like how do we develop faith when it just doesn't seem

336
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:56,040
possible or like when like we want to float but that's not what's happening

337
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:02,400
um so um for many people it's finding the Dharma

338
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:10,680
that works for them and exposing oneself to it so if if for whatever reason if um

339
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:16,619
Tibetan Buddhism is really the type of Dharma that really does it for you

340
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:23,099
um go for that or if there's a particular teacher that really inspires you

341
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:29,940
listen to that teacher's teaching so whatever helps um kind of like stoke the fire

342
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:36,359
like expose yourself to that and then also spending time with Dharma friends so you might not have any Dharma friends

343
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:42,060
and that's fine but that's why you can come to places like this and strike up a conversation with someone

344
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:47,400
so these are different things that can help cultivate faith and then there's also

345
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,740
this idea of leaning on the faith of a teacher so

346
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:58,140
maybe you don't have faith but you see that there's a teacher somebody who's a

347
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:03,900
more experienced armor practitioner than yourself and it seems like the Dharma is working for them

348
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:10,920
so you may not have felt it in your own life yet which I know isn't the case for you but for some people you know they

349
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:18,660
may not have felt it in their own life yet but they can see it's working for this other person so um sometimes that's

350
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:24,359
talked about is you can lean on the faith of another you can lean on the faith of somebody

351
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:30,540
that you're like okay I haven't felt it for myself but I I'm going to trust this because I see it's working for someone

352
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:36,480
else those are a few different access points

353
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,040
thank you so dude

354
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,720
um I guess as far as uh Joy um

355
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:07,320
that I've been feeling is just coming here and practicing and then seeing it

356
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:16,460
translate little by little in um you know life life outside of here

357
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:24,260
so I'm definitely feeling you know grateful for that and um

358
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:32,900
so you know thank thank you to to Insight Meditation Center for that

359
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:42,060
thanks for sharing the um you know I appreciate what you said about you

360
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:50,040
know you come practice here and then you see it changing your life outside of here so I that can be a continuation of

361
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:56,339
our garden analogy where you know we plant a seed we give it good conditions

362
00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:02,460
but then we don't control when it it sends up a shoot and so I often think

363
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:09,300
of that in terms of meditation practice you know every time we bring the Mind back it's like planting a seed every

364
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:15,060
time we cultivate loving kindness It's like planting a seed and you go out in your life

365
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:20,700
and lo and behold you know maybe you're having an interaction a difficult

366
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:27,420
interaction with a friend and one of those seeds Sprouts at that moment and you say the kind thing rather

367
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:34,500
than the harmful thing or there's a moment of frustration and

368
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:42,660
one of those seed sprouts and you're able to be mindful of the frustration rather than just acting on it mindlessly

369
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:49,200
so there's a really sweet way that yeah doing this practice it sprouts in our life when we leave here and it's so um

370
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,839
it's very faith building to get to see in one's own life how the Dharma is

371
00:41:54,839 --> 00:42:00,780
working so that can be another source of faith is reflecting on times that the Dharma

372
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:08,220
has been helpful in reminding ourselves of those times thanks for sharing

373
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:16,640
um I think I also wanted to add if I made um I noticed uh

374
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,660
I get if we don't feel like I don't know if this is true but like if

375
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:33,420
I don't feel very hopeful in the moment it seems like that um

376
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:38,760
just simply by participating with a teacher or with the Sangha

377
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,720
we can we can access kind of kind of by leaning

378
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:50,220
um so I think that maybe that kind of takes some of the pressure

379
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:56,820
off of uh oh like why why don't I feel you know are you like is there something

380
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:02,460
wrong with me because I'm worrying so much about tomorrow or you know I'm thinking

381
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,500
um you know certain pessimistic thoughts

382
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:13,680
but I feel that with with an ongoing practice we

383
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:22,680
can we can kind of access this this uh hope and kind of a more simplistic way

384
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:28,200
is that kind of go off of what what you're sharing I

385
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:33,960
think totally yeah if um yeah if you come in here and your

386
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:40,380
mind's going a mile a minute and you're feeling hopeless or uh

387
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:46,560
you know there's tons of discursive thought and will this ever work for me or you know all these different things

388
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,960
that the mind can say just exposing yourself to this environment um

389
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,960
uh you're yeah the mind is um uh

390
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:04,319
absorbing some really helpful conditions and that can take somebody really far

391
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:09,420
so yeah you don't have to worry too much about what the mind's doing in any given moment you know that's just the fruiting

392
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:16,980
of past Karma and just meet that with mindfulness thanks for sharing all right we should

393
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:22,980
oh we should probably wrap it up because it's nine but you're welcome to come say hi after if you'd like

394
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:28,319
