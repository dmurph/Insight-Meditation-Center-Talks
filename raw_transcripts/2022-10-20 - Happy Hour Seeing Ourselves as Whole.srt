2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,480
rendition of happy hour lovely to be with you lovely to be with you

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,980
ah so so for today's practice I'd like to

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:30,300
invite us um with a practice that I want to call

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,079
seeing ourselves as whole seeing ourselves conceptualizing seeing

6
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:44,040
accepting loving ourselves as whole or list or for just for Simplicity

7
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,140
seeing ourselves as whole and

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,420
not not that we go around the world and always the first conception is that

9
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:02,160
we're broken in some way but sometimes there could be a sense that either there's some either physical

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:10,680
challenge we have or or maybe there are some ways that we are um

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,140
um highly say um [Music]

12
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,320
we we self-flagellate we are judgmental of ourselves because of oh you talk too

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:29,520
much or you talk too little or you love too much or you love too little or you're too this or you're too that just

14
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,939
all these things you know the self-judgments um and

15
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:43,280
and in some ways maybe we don't see ourselves as whole sometimes there is something not quite maybe there's some

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,320
challenges or or say trauma there has been in the past so and if any in any

17
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,479
way we don't see or conceive or of ourselves as whole or if say there's a

18
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:02,880
back pain so we see our limitations we focus on the limitations of this back pain or or this physical condition or

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,759
our aging right oh yeah I don't have as as much energy as I used to so all these

20
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,640
ways that maybe we don't see ourselves as full as whole

21
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:22,319
as whole what if what if we tune what if we choose intentionally not to be

22
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,140
pollyanish that's not the intention at all but given that the Brahma vihara is

23
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,420
the the practices of the heart are cultivation practices or cultivation

24
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,940
practices where we cultivate a particular way of seeing a particular

25
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:45,959
way of saying we cultivate to see through the eyes of kindness Through The Eyes of Mecca compassion

26
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,540
gratitude these this is what we cultivate little by little by little so

27
00:02:51,540 --> 00:03:00,720
these are cultivation practices whereas with mindfulness with inside practice with a vipassana we see things as they

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,720
are but then again one I argue and it is true that we're still seeing from a

29
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,560
particular perspective we're seeing things from a particular perspective even though we're not we're cultivating

30
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,140
to see from a particular perspective

31
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,739
um with non-attachment with with Equanimity with with ease with curiosity

32
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:32,640
with non-judgment so there's still some cultivation is going on in Insight it's not just seeing things as they are we're

33
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,580
staying in a particular way but anyway I digress especially in the practice of the Brahma

34
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,060
vihara as the practices of the heart meta compassion

35
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:49,500
vicarious Joy Equanimity we are cultivating a particular way of seeing

36
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,459
particular way of being in the world and what if we actually choose to tune

37
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,920
into to tune into what is whole

38
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:12,060
what is whole what is beautiful what is strong what is lovely our own loveliness

39
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,900
our own strength our own goodness or this particular way

40
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:24,660
of seeing as a way of cultivating yes again not

41
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,479
condoning that yes there is work to do and there's cultivation to be done and

42
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:38,580
yet by turning to see what is good what is whole what is whole

43
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,280
and this way of seeing what is whole can be about are our goodness our

44
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,560
wholesomeness our kindness and mouse could be about or the way we show up in

45
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,820
the world this the physicality of the scent just the way we sit because sometimes actually not sometimes but

46
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:03,600
they go together our phys our embodiment goes together with our state of mind our

47
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,900
state of our it's [Music] um there's a lot more I can say about that

48
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:17,580
I'm going to tease myself bring myself back so that doesn't become an R long darn it but um our physicality or

49
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:26,100
embodiment is so important in the way that we show up in the world it affects our embodiment impacts our way of being

50
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:33,120
our way of being impacts our embodiment so both of these are important so so as

51
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,639
a way of working with that I have a particular invitation that I will bring

52
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,120
in tonight so um and it's it's inviting the embodiment

53

00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,760
and appreciating appreciating our own goodness our own wholeness

167
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,400
in our hearts bowing to the

168
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:19,859
human being we invited or or the archetype

169
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:27,480
for their support and with generosity sharing

170
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,760
the goodness of our cultivation trusting there is goodness here

171
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:39,859
trusting there is goodness we showed up we tried we've done our best

172
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:47,540
trusting there is goodness sharing that goodness with all beings everywhere

173
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:54,240
there is a little more goodness in the world as we practiced even if we deem it

174
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:00,900
distracted or sleepy there are moments awakefulness so

175
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:08,700
appreciating ourselves and dedicating that to all things everywhere may all beings be happy

176
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:13,820
may all beings be free including ourselves

yeah yeah let's uh transition well I see some

188
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:15,800
Reflections coming when the person says it felt very soothing

189
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:22,680
Brian says after feeling a sense of enoughness I started to visualize my piece my business in a very different

190
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:29,099
way the money we generate being something that flows in and out nice I

191
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:36,960
like that nice different relationship to Dharma in the world yeah

192
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,900
one of you says let's see it's been sent to me private I showed up I tried I did

193

So Beautiful to connect with that another person says uh very peaceful

195
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:06,300
yeah foreign something that we don't own yes

196
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:12,599
money exactly flowing in this and say Yes Brian who was talking who was sharing the

197
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:18,480
reflection of visualizing money going in and out yes the flow the flow generosity

198
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,900
nothing is ours really just passing through this life for a limited time we

199
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:30,240
don't take it with us we didn't come with any of it

200
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:37,040
similar for businesses it's all a flow it's all a flow

201
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,220
in between all beings flow of generosity

202
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:50,460
resources yeah beautiful thank you for those reflections

203
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:56,339
so I wonder what do you aspire to in this practice as you were practicing as

204
00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:05,460
you were coming together as you were sitting and inviting a an archetype or a being and seeing

205
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:13,079
yourself in the in the ways you aspire to what is your aspiration what are your

206
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,900
values that would be something lovely to

207
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:25,920
to reflect on and also to hold yourself with to let yourself be held witnessed

208
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:33,599
by others so that is the prompt for our breakout groups which we'll go to in the

209
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,980
moment after Neil says what he wants to say oh Neil you disappeared where'd you go there you are

210
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:46,200
yeah um you know I I really like this practice

211
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,660
you know I just find it you know I find in picturing someone and then like

212
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:57,900
becoming them it's a strategy that routinely works for me I use it often you know and I I just found myself just

213
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:02,940
being very very generous and caring with myself it was it was very sweet and

214

um with respect to the pro the um practice and uh the practice the the

221
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:58,800
breakout groups um what we'll do is roughly groups of three

222
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,900
oh we'll see how the size ends up but let yours is so beautiful to let

223
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:09,480
yourself be held witness when you speak when you say your aspiration your

224
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,640
intention your goodness this is what I aspire to I aspire to

225
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:20,520
or truthfulness I find myself telling White Lies We don't have to say that

226
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:26,099
part no I aspire to be truthful or whatever it is it's so beautiful to be

227
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:33,119
held witness and share share your aspirations share your goodness because that's the sign there is there's a lot

228
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,940
of goodness here aspirations so you can share your

229
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:44,099
aspiration if you like you can say something about the practice or you can

230
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:50,819
just say you know pass when your turn comes it can say pass maybe in the next few right when it comes back to you

231
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:57,119
maybe you'll say something maybe you don't maybe you just hold the space so

232
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:04,020
so um so let's go the order of

233
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:10,800
um of um first name alphabetical order just offer a nugget the next person will

234
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,040
offer a nugget the next person will offer nugget or silence then you go around and round a few times and it's

235
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,920
lovely to be with Sangha to be generous with others to hold them it's so fun to

236
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:29,220
to offer generosity to others and and also receive generosity so

237
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,920
so enjoy this practice it's quite sweet and take care of each

238
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:42,900
other take care of yourselves I'm opening the rooms now here we go everybody's back welcome back and we've

239
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:48,720
got a few minutes for Reflections for comments questions what did you discover

240
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,060
in the groups what was that like

241
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,900
especially if you're new we'd love to hear from you Richard

242
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:10,680
well my aspiration is is to be focused in what I do with with whatever I'm

243
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:18,839
doing you know whether it's reading or playing music or whatever it is and I guess that's the the concentration

244
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:26,280
part of the Eightfold Path am I wrong there no that's that's good that's it yeah

245
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:33,540
yeah that is a concentration part yeah well actually it's um

246
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:40,619
it's partly concentration uh on the Eightfold Path it's also uh

247
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:46,560
I would say a little bit of it would be uh wise

248
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:54,420
so so part of it is also wise engagement or energy Viria so

249
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:59,880
that's another way of you want to be engaged in a in a fruitful and wholesome

250
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,280
way so I would say a little bit of it of that is there too yeah thanks Richard

251
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,440
yeah bill says I found that when I directed my attention to my breath I

252
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:17,819
tightened up constricted oh it's interesting ah it's uh how was this different from

253
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:23,640
practicing other times Bill do you want to say you don't you don't have to say anything but if you want it you're

254
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:31,859
welcome to I don't know maybe I was just more conscious of my breath this time out but it's it's not like you know when

255
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:39,000
you're about to fall asleep and your breath is just very much at ease it was it was definitely not that it was it was

256
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,480
it's just like it by paying attention to my breath there's something about it that seems to where I tighten up with

257
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:52,260
the breathing and it becomes more constricted so it's interesting because I I know that this was happening for you

258
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:59,160
some time ago and then you've been working with it and there's a lot of ease and relaxation that has this hasn't

259
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:04,560
come up for a while I haven't heard you mentioned this for a while so it's always different it's interesting for

260
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:10,500
you to explore right yeah what made this different to to after having worked with

261
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:17,160
bringing your center of gravity attention all of that down it's interesting yeah I'm not entirely sure

262
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:24,780
well I can't say is that my battery is running low so if I if I if I wink that's what's happening great thank you

263
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:31,200
thanks any other Reflections or any quick ones from from the groups from being held witness or holding other

264
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:38,900
people witnessed with their aspirations was it did you find it inspiring or not

265
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:46,880
just so that I know whether this is a good prompt for next time feedback

266
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:09,240
Katrin um yeah I liked it it's challenging for me

267
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:14,940
that but I really liked your emphasis on embodying these beings as opposed to

268
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:22,740
like thinking about how I might be like them because then I'm like well then I'm super not living up to that

269
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:29,280
um so and I've and just the invitation to connect with Kuan Yin was really

270
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,339
lovely so yeah I think that feeling like in my body how because

271
00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:42,720
my body is like there's nothing wrong that's where there's nothing wrong so and my body knows about face of goodness

272
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:50,339
beautiful natural state great thank you Catherine I love the the embodimentification embodiment and and
