1
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,519
so um so good evening uh

2
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,080
welcome welcome folks

3
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,040
um okay you know what we're going to

4
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,760
do so uh find your uh find your

5
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,640
posture find your your heart

6
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:02,040
just take your cues from the silence

7
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:40,800
sense of actually attuning to silence even if there's

8
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,599
noise elsewhere

9
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:13,199
yeah we don't just infer the silence by the absence of sound and

10
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,919
we listen to the silence

11
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,919
and for a little

12
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:14,560
pleasantness and unpleasantness our preferences become

13
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,280
incidental for a little

14
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:39,520
while the the blizzard of details that constitutes your

15
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:46,599
autobiography becomes incidental

16
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,160
for a little while what you thought you

17
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,680
knew also becomes incidental

18
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,640
just to receive the

19
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,360
moment is enough

20
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,920
no projects no

21
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,760
building you're neither the project

22
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,399
manager nor the project

23
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:11,160
In meditation practice we stop messing with ourselves

24
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,600
surrender is the

25
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:26,360
dissolution of uh valitional energies

26
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,120
to the extent you build anything uh let it be

27
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,959
love otherwise just

28
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,720
receive space receiving face

29
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:46,039
each moment a kind of new opportunity to let down

30
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:41,000
our uh lives so-called lives are

31
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,360
um worries and hopes

32
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,679
and it's kind of going take care of

33
00:23:54,679 --> 00:24:00,120
itself we'll win some and lose some

34
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,200
but for now for these

35
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:25,679
minutes we're practicing surrendering

36
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:35,080
control of not medicating this thought and that feeling

37
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:07,240
and when we emerge our life will be waiting for us

38
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:20,279
the same just a tiny bit different

39
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,579
[Music]

40
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:42,320
okay it's good to uh good to practice with you such a wild path

41
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,640
it's It's sort of like uh you know it looks like a

42
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:54,519
Labradoodle from the Flyers but um it's a

43
00:33:54,519 --> 00:34:02,360
tiger and um I love labradoodles

44
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:14,398
so Dharma um is in in conversation with um with

45
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:21,320
science uh I think in a uh increasingly respectful

46
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:27,040
uh way meaning that both sides are listening both sides are learning from

47
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:35,760
each other and there are a lot of um dharma dharma kind of um scientific

48
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,320
research people who are have a genuine affection for the path and understand it

49
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:49,240
and um that's having its effects i remember uh I think it was

50
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:55,000
2006 you know I was a summer research fellow for the uh mind and

51
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,960
life you know conference and uh sort of scientific conference but then also par

52
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:07,520
retreat sitting on a Zafu and next to me is kind of like the eminent uh

53
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,920
researcher Richard Davidson he's like there sitting on a Zafu next to me he

54
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:20,480
didn't send one of his 500 research assistants or something to do his

55
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,000
sitting he's there you know and um the

56
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,280
science folks are kind of like taking dharma concepts exploring them bringing

57
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,440
in new new language and concepts and um and

58
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,359
then sort of like importing it back to dharma you know and and um you why it's

59
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:49,280
been meaningful for me to to consume some of that uh work

60
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:56,960
so this is uh kind of edited from a couple social psychologists uh uh

61
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:04,079
Richard Ryan and uh Kirk Warren Brown and um shared this over the weekend but

62
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:11,839
wanted to unpack it so uh the authors write um some people are preoccupied with

63
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:17,400
questions of worth and esteem see their worth as dependent upon reaching certain

64
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,280
standards appearing certain ways or accomplishing certain goals the very

65
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,599
process of placing oneself in the role of object and then evaluating its worth

66
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:35,040
is a motivated act whether such individuals come away with positive or

67
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:42,400
negative conclusions the very fact that one's esteem is in question suggests a

68
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:49,520
psychological vulnerability although self-evaluation is a natural human tendency with both

69
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,119
evolutionary and developmental foundations ongoing concern with the

70
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,240
worth of the self is a byproduct of need

71
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,920
deprivation or conflict the salience of self-esteem to

72
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,839
a person is a sign of need deficiencies rather than need

73
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:19,079
fulfillment they go on to say regulation based on mindfulness rather than contingent

74
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:24,560
self-regard associated with healthier and more vital living and provides a

75
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,000
basis for acting more authentically

76
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,680
so they say um self-evaluation

77
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:43,040
uh is a natural you know human tendency and it makes sense that in our pursuit

78
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,880
of goals we assess we sometimes measure we're not

79
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:56,359
um you know the teachings on not self they're it's not getting moralistic or

80
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:02,160
idealistic Remember Ajin Sado saying like this is not an idealistic path the

81
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,960
Buddha just spoke about the way things

82
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:12,320
are and the delusion in the the kind of

83
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,359
quest for self-esteem the compulsive measurement

84
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:26,400
and comparison the delusion is to think that we're going to drive the same self to

85
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,440
the goal and arrive and find

86
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,800
rest the very process of placing oneself

87
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:47,000
in the role of object you know then evaluating its worth is problematic they

88
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,920
say making oneself a kind of object Matthew then turning into kind of

89
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,119
spectator it's a little what I was alluding to in the sit spectator and

90
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:08,560
evaluating my worth what's my what's Matthew's worth it's painful

91
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:16,838
and to even have that question you know they suggest is

92
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:25,040
um a function of psychological vulnerability and health by this view is

93
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,920
finding a way to step out of the debate of worthiness and

94
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:38,160
unworthiness entirely to step out you enter you lose you've already

95
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:46,920
lost i remember Jack Kornfield saying in a in

96
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:54,200
a retreat talk um to the SA something like uh you were a child of the

97
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:01,440
Buddha and was sort of like never thought of myself that way but was

98
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:08,640
touched by that and um it was not not your special it was

99
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:16,480
not not like Matthew you you're the Buddha's favorite

100
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:22,480
child so ordinary you know so ordinary and of

101
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,800
course worthy i really we normally link worthy

102
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:35,960
with extraordinary but I link worthiness with with like utter

103
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:44,240
ordinariness the path moves us towards

104
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:51,880
ordinariness and uh that's strange you know that the the practice makes us feel

105
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:59,040
so ordinary but that feeling is a blessing that's a way that we begin to

106
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,079
step out of the kind of morass of self-

107
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:11,920
view the pros and cons what I find uh intriguing here is

108
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:18,040
that the selfing is understood to be a symptom of need

109
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:25,280
deprivation the selfing is a symptom the selfing arises out of pain

110
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,119
normally we um we talk about self as a cause you

111
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:39,119
know here it's an effect we normally say the self-causes da da da da da here it's an effect and

112
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:45,359
it's the effect of pain of need

113
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:52,720
deprivation and uh in the past I've I've suggested that um the self is an effect

114
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,200
of fear that fundamental force kind

115
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:05,760
of tied to survival and just intuitively seems like you know

116
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:13,640
we really would not need a self were it not for the brutality of

117
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:22,040
samsara this uh realm of gain and loss birth and death

118
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,599
if there were no pressure to track and integrate threat and

119
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:35,839
opportunity we wouldn't have to stay so glued together there's a sense of like oh yeah

120
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:43,079
the self is the kind of like intersection of the pressure to

121
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:47,480
act and control

122
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:56,040
and so we can begin to um understand why

123
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:02,119
uh you know teachers say the the self is done by

124
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:10,319
grasping not exactly the self that grasps the self is done by

125
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:17,119
grasping and then the question from Brown and Ryan is like okay how do we

126
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:25,040
resolve the need deprivation that made self-worth a

127
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:33,839
preoccupation and there's a kind of like intermediate steps in between

128
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:43,400
um self harshness and forgetting the self there's a kind of thawing process

129
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:49,960
uh so that our in a sense our needs somehow we find them

130
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:57,720
met and the question of our worth recedes becomes more and more incidental

131
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,880
um a yoga teacher i remember um in LA

132
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,920
and uh when I was when I was living there and she would say maybe quoting

133
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:17,680
Ayenar something like um whatever we'd be in a pose it would

134
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,960
be I don't know how much yoga is supposed to hurt but it hurt from the

135
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,800
beginning to the end hurt good but it kind of didn't stop

136
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,880
hurting anyway she would say whatever Whatever is heavy make light whatever is

137
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,040
light make heavy and I was just trying to like

138
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,480
survive but I love that line you know and I could get it i could sense like

139
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,280
all the places I was heavy i needed to make light places

140
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,800
light make heavy whatever is

141
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:03,119
heavy with self we make

142
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:09,319
light and the dharma normalizes our pain at a very deep

143
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:18,640
level and the shame you know begins to for the the

144
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:28,240
wounds for the needs met and unmet shame begins to melt and dissolve thaw

145
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:36,800
out we're instructed to um to align our conduct right to live in

146
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:43,400
accordance with our own deepest values and cila sila the

147
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:51,720
um ethical conduct is associated with a certain kind of self-respect

148
00:45:51,720 --> 00:46:00,560
non-regret certain kind of dignity okay I'm living I'm not perfectly but I'm I'm living in accord

149
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,599
with my what I care about what I think is worthy of my

150
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:16,280
love some dignity in Yes and we take refuge we take refuge

151
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:22,319
buddha take refuge and the details of our life they

152
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:30,640
still matter but more and more they become that word

153
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:37,079
I came back to a few times in the sit incidental

154
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,920
that's not uncaring but

155
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:51,119
incidental in the sense of of um life always happening to me to me experience

156
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:57,520
happening to me life is just

157
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:04,760
happening and we look how much self is needed to

158
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:10,440
function you know how much self is needed to

159
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:16,119
function and when is self just kind of expression of

160
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:23,920
some pain and one just you know tends to uh tends to that pain like

161
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:29,000
a wound when is it enough just to

162
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,880
um just to be a person

163
