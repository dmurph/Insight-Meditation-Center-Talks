1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,800
everyone and

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,559
welcome

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,320
and it's probably fair to say or

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,800
certainly supports deeper exploration of ourselves and

5
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,640
meditation is the idea

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:38,520
from zen master dogen founder of whole Zen School of

7
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:46,559
Zen where he said that mindfulness of the body is the body's

8
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:54,079
mindfulness and what that does is it kind of switches around our idea of

9
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,480
mindfulness where there's a very strong emphasis on subject and object

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:08,799
that there's somehow you maybe in the head for some of you who is doing the

11
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,439
mindfulness and that you're in charge of the mindfulness and uh and there's the body

12
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:22,240
down there below the body is an object of attention and there's nothing inherently

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,520
wrong with that separation that distinction but it

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,159
can lend itself to a lot of challenges and we build on that to it leads to a

15
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:39,000
lot of suffering but to say it's the body's

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,920
mindfulness is to put mindfulness in the body as intimately

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,960
part of the body and maybe if we instead of translate Sati as mindfulness we

18
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,840
translate it as awareness that mindfulness is the body's

19
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,240
awareness and uh we're not aware of the

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,520
body but the body is aware of itself both can happen so I don't want

21
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,000
to rule out or all the rich wonderful ways in which

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,280
we can be which awareness operates for us but to appreciate and some deep way

23
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:32,040
in which awareness is the body arises from the

24
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,519
body so one way to understand this is

25
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:44,840
that sensing and Sensations are inseparable some people

26
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:52,360
might say that sensing and Sensations are ndu there's no subject object

27
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,760
distinction between the two they arise together when there's a

28
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:05,640
sensation there's the sensing when there's a sensing the senses are

29
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:13,040
stimulated there are Sensations without a s without a

30
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,200
stimulus it's almost as if the sensing doesn't exist but as soon as it stimulus

31
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:24,200
the sensing comes alive and now is activated and so right

32
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,120
there there's this intimacy and so our body is filled with

33
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,879
organs of sensing organs that can experience

34
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:43,560
Sensations and right there in the location uh of where the sensing

35
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,120
occurs there's the opportunity of

36
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:57,959
relaxing the being the doer being the one who's straining or trying a lot in

37
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:05,920
meditation relaxing this separation of the doer being the the sub the

38
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,159
subject being the doer the one who has to perform has to succeed the one who's

39
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,720
not succeeding the one who's the victim of how difficult things are the one who

40
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:24,400
is s succeeding and look how great I am there's a kind of ability to relax

41
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,600
deeply and when relaxation is it isn't like progress to Deep deeper and deeper

42
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,759
relaxation but relaxation to the point where the alertness can feel that

43
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,919
inseparability of awareness in the body it isn't that we are the

44
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,919
body it isn't that the body is us we're not in the body the body is not

45
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,280
in US these things the sensations The Experience just

46
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:04,840
is and we re and there's a relaxation to it and our job is to open to allow to

47
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:12,039
rest in the body to feel this and one of the ways the Buddha

48
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:18,160
emphasized that supports this is to relax the

49
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:23,960
body so we'll begin with

50
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:31,479
relaxing and I'll do a kind of guided scan of the body scan of for relaxation

51
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:40,000
and U and uh one of the things

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,039
to attend to as you relax is how

53
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,080
relaxing the body either relaxes the

54
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:59,600
mind or brightens the mind it brings a kind of a gentle soft kind of alertness

55
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,280
to the mind and then we can relax some more and

56
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,680
feel the impact that has on the mind or allow the impact on the mind to relax

57
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,440
more so assuming a meditation

58
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:23,960
posture and

59
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,400
gently lower your gaze

60
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,360
close your

61
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:48,759
eyes and begin with some deeper breaths maybe 3/4

62
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:58,800
full and the intentionality of breathing in more deeply supports an intentionality to be

63
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,680
here and now connected to your

64
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:14,360
body breathing in fully and relaxing as the body as you

65
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,800
exhale breathing in stretching the Torso the shoulders the back rib

66
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:33,360
cage and some of the relaxing just comes from feeling as you

67
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:41,638
exhale almost like the desire of the body to soften to

68
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,758
release breathing in breathing out

69
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,080
relaxing and then letting your breathing return to

70
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,440
normal and as you

71
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,120
inhale feel your forehead and

72
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:24,840
eyes feel whatever tension or holding or buzzing or whatever is

73
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,440
there and as you exhale for the next few

74
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,760
breaths relax around the eyes the forehead the

75
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,120
temple as you breathe in feel the rest of your

76
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,800
face the Jaws cheeks the

77
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,839
mouth and on the exhale relax

78
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:31,120
soften as if the muscles can fall away from the bone

79
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,640
let go on the

80
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:51,839
exhale ever so slightly you might let your teeth fall away from each

81
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,600
other or loosening any tightness around the

82
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,040
lips maybe the lips fall apart ever so

83
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,640
slightly on the inhale feeling your shoulders and the movements of the

84
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,000
shoulders tension of the shoulders

85
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,480
and on the exhale with a great

86
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,040
gentleness let the shoulder soften and

87
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,160
relax whenever you relax and then feel your shoulders afterwards

88
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,639
s have the sensations of the shoulders changed at

89
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,639
all continue with your shoulders but take a moment

90
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:33,720
to adjust your hands and arms so they are

91
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:41,000
relaxed and are position to support the shoulders

92
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,480
relaxing and then on the inhale halale feeling your heart

93
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,079
center your

94
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:18,440
chest on the exhale let there be a softening in the chest

95
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,199
releasing releasing this is settling or something in your chest

96
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:43,000
settles backwards like settling into a

97
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
chair

98
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,639
on the exhale feeling the

99
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,880
belly maybe as you exhale to already

100
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:33,480
relax so as you inhale the belly expands

101
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,959
freely and relaxing on the exhale

102
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,959
too so there's something in the belly that

103
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
settles

104
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,480
on the inhale feeling the legs the

105
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,240
thighs and letting there be a way of softening through the

106
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
legs

107
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:21,040
and then as you inhale feeling any tightness or pressure in the

108
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:32,839
thinking mind any physical sensations of being energized or or agitated

109
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,959
or any of the sensations connected to

110
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:47,360
thinking and if you feel any physical Sensations in the often in the forehead

111
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:54,160
behind the forehead it could be in the neck and the

112
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,600
shoulders could be in the back of the skull

113
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,399
as you exhale

114
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,800
soften that tension or tightness

115
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:25,160
energy and if it doesn't soften directly soften around

116
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
it

117
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:45,240
relaxing the thinking mind calming the thinking

118
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:55,959
mind and see if you do so if there's a brightening of

119
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:06,558
awareness not the awareness that you do but the awareness that

120
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:34,000
is maybe Imagining the mind to be like a large

121
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:41,960
Ocean and the softening relaxing is a calming of the

122
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,559
Waves so the surface of the Mind spreads wide and

123
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:56,120
far horizontally in all directions becoming Stiller and

124
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
quieter

125
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
for

126
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,520
and then becoming aware of how your body feels

127
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,520
now sensing the sensations of the

128
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:09,840
body in a relaxed open way in whatever way they

129
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:27,240
appear feeling the intimacy of sensing and

130
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Sensations

131
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:41,880
the sensations that appear maybe can they're not W or

132
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,480
constructed or made to

133
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,400
happen they occur whatever causes and

134
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,480
conditions of what it's like to be alive right right

135
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:08,760
now Sensations are a proof of being

136
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,200
alive let awareness

137
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,159
rest in the locations where Sensations occur

138
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,840
so the body feels

139
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:51,520
itself so that mindfulness is the body's awareness of

140
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
itself

141
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

142
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

143
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

144
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

145
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

146
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

147
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

148
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

149
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
e

150
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

151
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
for

152
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,600
and then as we come to the end of this

153
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:08,799
sitting take a three breath Journey with relaxing more deeply

154
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,398
letting go with each

155
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:34,080
exhale and now another three breath

156
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,760
Journey this time emphasizing the

157
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,600
inhale as if the inhale welcomes opens

158
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,000
you to The Wider world all around

159
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
you

160
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:11,360
and considering if there's any way known or or

161
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:18,200
unknown that this meditation session has benefited

162
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,279
you are there ways that you can turn that benefit

163
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:29,440
around so that it also benefits others

164
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:37,159
if you're calmer now maybe your

165
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:43,679
calmness can be calming for someone in distress that you meet

166
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:54,799
today if you're more patient maybe you can be more patient

167
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,398
with someone who's challenged today

168
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,320
if you feel more tender

169
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:18,720
friendly maybe when people you meet who are challenged today you

181
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:47,799
thank

182
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
you

183
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,039
so hello and welcome to this third talk on mindfulness of the

184
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:50,200
body and one of the important areas of mindfulness

185
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:57,760
practice is relaxation or calming the language of the Buddha maybe

186
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,279
the word he uses closer to our English word calming if we think of it as a

187
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:09,480
physical calming and as and many people

188
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:17,360
associate uh meditation with relaxation with calming a softening a gentling of our

189
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:25,519
body and mind and heart a significant thing begins

190
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:32,240
happening if have any degree of relaxation or calmness that's more than

191
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,279
how we live our life normally and that is that we the the

192
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:44,080
relaxation of the body becomes a reference point to understand ourselves

193
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,519
better and and what I mean by this is that if we're more relaxed than we usually

194
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:56,600
are then uh we have a chance to notice when we return to how we usually are

195
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,639
because we're tensing up because we're becoming a little bit more

196
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:06,679
agitated and to be able to have a physical reference point for this is

197
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:13,120
then we can see more closely can see we're more able to notice when we're

198
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,200
engaged in some activity some way of being which is tensing we can take a see

199
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:26,399
what's going on better for one thing we just simply see we're becoming more tense and then we can ask the question

200
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:32,720
do we want to go along with that or do we want to come back to the place we just

201
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,080
were and um and uh and then one

202
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:44,480
definition of meditation that I've heard is set yourself at

203
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:51,480
ease and notice what takes away that ease so let yourself be calm and notice

204
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:57,559
what takes away that calm let your body be somewhat relaxed doesn't have to be dramatic just a little bit more than you

205
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:05,600
usually are and then notice what takes you away from that and if you do that then you can ask the question um should

206
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,040
I continue doing this is this necessary is there an

207
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,200
alternative what needs to be done be taken care of can I do it without being

208
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:23,040
so tense what would that look like and as we so this relaxing of the

209
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,520
body becomes a reference point and that reference point is particularly useful

210
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:35,000
in meditation because in meditation um there's nothing you know we have to do

211
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,919
in the world so this idea of do I need to get tense right now I think it's

212
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:46,118
easier in meditation to come to the conclusion no I don't need to right now

213
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:51,320
maybe when the meditation is over I need to but now I don't and so there's a

214
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:58,599
questioning and a and a doubting the value of of the the the

215
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:04,200
ways that we get tense up which is also equivalent to the ways in which we get

216
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:10,880
preoccupied or caught in our thoughts or our feelings and um and then we can see more

217
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,599
clearly what's going on and if we decide there's no need we don't have to and we

218
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:21,839
recognize that it's physical tension we have then we might be able to soften

219
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:30,200
that relax it and one of the great ways of relaxing that I found for myself is

220
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:38,400
sometimes it can be done directly but sometimes it's just to feel the places of tension in my body and then breathe

221
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,359
with it kind of like uh breathing through it uh accompanying the

222
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:50,640
experience with the Rhythm physical rhythms of the body breathing it's almost like an act of imagination like

223
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:57,359
I'm breathing in through that tension rather than through my nostrils and breathing out through it it's is using

224
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:03,160
your imagination a little bit but somehow the pairing up the places of

225
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:10,599
tension with the breathing the breathing itself the rhythm of breathing can be relaxing the being with the breath that

226
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:16,400
way is a way of uh feeling and being with something like a massage without

227
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,760
being caught in the reactivities of the Mind around being tense or or with it

228
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,240
the reactivity it's causing the tension so it's shifting our local

229
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:34,880
of uh of uh attention that way and um and the more we can then can see in our

230
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,920
tension rather than feeling that tension is an unfortunate thing uh it's actually

231
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:49,720
a door to deeper understanding of what's happening with us so tension is not

232
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,599
necessarily we don't necessarily want to be in a hurry to relax and that's one

233
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:02,400
way to tense up even even more is to feel like oh this is wrong I need to be relaxed but to be very easy with it and

234
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,440
and uh certainly it's good to relax if it's easy easy to do it but it's also

235
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,839
the being present for physical tension begins and learning how to be

236
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:21,079
comfortable with discomfort learn just to be equanimous calm about being tense so

237
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:26,200
about being agitated um is a powerful tool powerful

238
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:32,839
Foundation for deepening this practice so just like in the very beginning of

239
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:39,720
this intro to meditation course I talked about how distractions don't need to be treated as the enemy or problem for

240
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:48,119
meditation seeing we're distracted and being mindful of it that's mindfulness then mindfulness succeeded so the same

241
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:54,040
thing is true of the tensions and the agitations that are in our system in our

242
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:00,760
body um uh those that too we open to in mindfulness without the idea that it

243
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,160
needs to be different or should be different and if we have that need or

244
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,520
have that Shing going on that's one of the things that gets highlighted through

245
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:19,000
this reference point of focusing on on tension and relaxation and if you're very sensitive

246
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,200
you feel you can see how the Shing the needing the wanting is itself a form of

247
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,920
tension Maybe more a tension of the thinking mind perhaps or

248
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,560
something and so this fascinating reference point so much gets revealed so

249
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:45,800
so much many of the ways in which we the mind is operating in ways that are um um

250
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,839
not supportive of us not wholesome for us uh many of the ways in which we take

251
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:57,079
the wrong turn in the way we live our life gets manifested intention in the

252
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:05,040
body and so this ability to relax the body and then feel that as a reference

253
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,680
point to understand ourselves better um and if if you have a lot of kind of deep

254
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:18,359
experience of relaxation sometimes and there's it registered as a memory that can really that can also

255
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:25,480
support you sometime when you find yourself really tense and say wow that's really different than how this reference

256
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:32,119
points I have what's possible and should I just continue doing what I doing now or should I excuse myself from the

257
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:37,800
situation maybe ask if I can go to the bathroom and uh most people won't

258
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,680
question why you're going to the bathroom and um and but what you're doing is uh going there to breathe and

259
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:50,040
relax and there is this wonderful uh meditation

260
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:55,720
Throne that uh you can sit on for a while maybe with a lid down just sit on

261
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:03,800
it and meditate then close your mind maybe do three three breath Journeys doesn't

262
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:11,200
have to be long but uh uh to realize how tense we are realize how caught up we are and

263
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:18,880
question whether we need to continue that and then find simple ways okay let's do a three breath Journey let's

264
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,119
relax um uh this frees

265
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:29,839
up attention this frees up up mindfulness this frees up the the

266
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:37,760
mindfulness the sensing of the body a relaxed body is a field of sens sensing

267
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,960
Sensations maybe not distinct always maybe sense of of vibration or warmth or

268
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,839
tingling a um the more tense the body is we might

269
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:57,640
have some acute Sensations around the tension but when there's a lot of uh tightness tense muscle muscles there's

270
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:03,800
often a tendency for those muscles to go numb and too much tension and we lose a

271
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:10,839
connection to ourselves and um and uh and uh and the

272
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:16,520
relaxation is a re rediscovering that connection opening up to it

273
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:22,640
again so the theme of today is this mindfulness of the body is the value of

274
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,240
relaxation relaxation can be overdone it's shouldn't be a forever project that

275
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,599
just relax relax relax relax it becomes a kind of a but um but it is a very

276
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,720
important part of this terrain of mindfulness and um and it it's a

277
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:45,079
self-correcting one because if you pay attention to even the subtlest tensions

278
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:50,119
then you'll feel that you'll discover when relaxing is no longer needed or no

279
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:56,280
longer useful or that the focus and the way we're we're trying to relax has t

280
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,560
ention embedded in it and the self-correcting way in which mindfulness

281
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:08,520
and tension helps us for the mindfulness to be easeful at ease so that's so I

282
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:17,440
love this instructions that I said set yourself at ease and notice what takes you away from

283
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,720
it so I would uh encourage you today to

284
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:31,359
continue with mindfulness of the body being a theme and um and uh make uh T

285
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:39,520
tension holding contraction and relaxation use a physical sense of

286
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,839
unease and a sense of ease to guide you and to inform you and to help you feel a

287
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:53,079
deeper connection to what's going on and um don't be in a hurry to relax

288
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:59,280
uh sometimes what's really good even in meditation and elsewhere is don't relax at the first opportunity

289
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,880
you have but if you if there's some tension that could relax take a few

290
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:12,359
breaths to feel it better there's something about feeling tension more fully that can allow the relaxation to

291
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:19,800
be deeper feeling something more fully and then Letting Go can let the then the

292
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,000
Letting Go could be Fuller as well so take time during the day and for

293
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:33,160
those of you who have enjoyed the instruction to the the practice of setting a timer you might set a timer so

294
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:39,480
that uh periodically and regularly without forgetting about it um you get a

295
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:45,800
little reminder to check in about what's the tension what's the

296
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,160
relaxation what do you learn what's available with tension

297
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:57,200
relaxation as being a reference point for your life so thank

298
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:04,160
you very much and look forward to

299
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,160
tomorrow
