of good stuff here in the summer so for those of you who don't know I'm

18
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,619
Diana Clark as Martha said there at the beginning and it's a delight to be here with you all

19
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:18,319
some of you may know that I teach on Monday nights so here I am on a Sunday morning instead of a Monday night

20
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,879
but today I'd like to share a little bit about a suita my story specifically

21
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:29,640
that's in a suit uh and maybe I'll start by saying Gil and I

22
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,940
taught us to study course for ended up being almost two years it just ended

23
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:40,739
and a theme that we kept on pointing back to in so many different ways the

24
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:47,280
theme was the importance of direct experience like what is happening right

25
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,099
now this moment as opposed to our ideas about it as

26
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:58,920
opposed to some philosophy as opposed to some mystical or metaphysical ideas just

27
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,440
this you know encouragement to come back what's actually happening

28
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:12,540
In This Moment and it was quite something to see just how this showed up in the sutas in so

29
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:18,599
many different ways and I would say that a big part of practice is learning to make this

30
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,540
distinction you might think well that's obvious I know what I'm thinking and I know when

31
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,480
I'm sensing but it turns out this can be even more and more subtle the way that

32
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,819
our Concepts our Notions our ideas our beliefs our views our little bit

33
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:41,760
different than what's actually happening in this moment

34
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,720
and of course we do this of course humans do this they have ideas and Views

35
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,080
and opinions of course they do we need them but there's so much a way in which we

36
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,900
are often living in our heads instead of being embodied

37
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,780
there's a way in that we are looking for the answers we're looking for ease we're

38
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,080
looking for Comfort we're looking for happiness with something that's out there and out there being something that's

39
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:19,979
going to happen in the future or in another setting or anywhere but here

40
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:27,259
right and out there of course only exists in our minds doesn't happen right here in the moment

41
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,780
if we're not looking for a happiness and well-being or end of suffering with

42
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,820
something out there then maybe it shows up as we're trying to figure something

43
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,860
out like everything is going to be okay as soon as I solve this problem

44
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:51,900
or maybe there's that problem right have you noticed it never ends right and of course we do this many of us in

45
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:58,020
our professional lives or in certain education we've been rewarded for this type of thinking and just solve the

46
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:04,380
problem the next problem the next problem the next problem and everything will be fine and it's such a radical idea in some

47
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,080
ways that this teaching is pointing to can we just be with actually what the

48
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,120
experience is here and then Phil I'm going to ask you can

49
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,820
you put that volume just a little bit higher I feel like I'm straining a little bit with my voice to make it just

50
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,800
be a little bit louder thank you

51
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:32,039
so many of you will be familiar with this suta that I'll be uh

52
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:38,340
talking about it's the Bahia and I'm going to kind of tell this story

53
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,039
and then drop in some commentary as we go along

54
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,259
so the suta begins thus have I heard many of you know this is the common

55
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:55,620
beginning and maybe we could say once upon a time something like this

56
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:03,120
thus have I heard at one time the Buddha was staying near saviti in jetta's Grove and at the pindicus park I'll say that

57
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:10,220
so many sutas start this like where the Buddha is kind of giving a setting

58
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,900
now at that time Bahia at the bark cloth was residing by superica on the ocean

59
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:23,000
floor so but he he's in another place the Buddha's over here remember he is over there

60
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:30,419
was honored respected revered venerated and esteemed and he received robes alms

61
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:36,180
food lodging and medicine and supplies for this sake so they're kind of giving but he is

62
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:43,560
credentials you know who is this person he was a spiritual leader a lot of people followed him thoughts that he was

63
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,319
a good leader and these list robes almost Foods lodgings and Medicine those

64
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:55,139
are the usual like the list of four things that spiritual leaders need and in particular

65
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:01,440
Buddhist leaders need they would say they need those four things and only those four things but that's another

66
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:08,039
story to talk about that maybe we'll also say that be here is not

67
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:14,819
a Buddhist practitioner and partly we know this because he's wearing bark cloth

68
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:21,900
so just in the same way that we can tell the difference between who's a lay person who's a terravada monastic who's

69
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:28,380
a Zen practitioner who's a Tibetan monastic by what they're wearing in the same way back at the time of the

70
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:34,740
Buddha we could also but he's so he's not a Buddhist

71
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,020
practitioner but he's this esteemed spiritual leader

72
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:47,940
and then coming back to the sutta when Bahia was alone in seclusion we can

73
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:54,660
understand this as when he was meditating when he was alone in seclusion this line

74
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:01,220
of thinking appeared to his awareness now of those who in this world are

75
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,599
awakened or have entered the path of Awakening

76
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,180
am I one he's wondering about his practice he's

77
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:19,340
wondering I think I'm awake and everybody else thinks I'm awakened but am I really

78
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,780
so I appreciate this very much right but yeah he's not complacent just because

79
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:30,660
everybody thinks oh yeah okay this guy is uh a leader he's a spiritual leader

80
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:37,860
of course he has it all figured out of course he's not trying to solve problems or not in the present moment or whatever

81
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:44,940
it might be like all these things are kind of get projected onto spiritual leaders but he

82
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,459
wasn't buying all of it and this question am I really awakened

83
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:58,440
and importantly he allowed this doubt about his practice to be there he didn't

84
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:06,779
immediately push it away he didn't immediately start thinking of other things you know distract himself

85
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:11,880
or he was had this willingness to stay present

86
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:18,240
to that experience of having this doubt which you can imagine was an uncomfortable experience

87
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:28,200
to say well everybody thinks I am but am I really maybe this is different than having some

88
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:34,140
ideas of this imposter syndrome that sometimes or maybe it is the same as an

89
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:40,260
imposter syndrome that sometimes happens when people feel like well if people really knew me they wouldn't think what

90
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,720
they think about me it may be but he is doing this of course I don't really know

91
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,140
but his willingness to stay present and to stay open not to just collapse

92
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:58,620
and close down when there's this doubt about his practice shows up this willingness allows

93
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:05,880
another voice to enter so a continuation of the sutta

94
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:13,500
then a Deva who had once been a relative of behia's compassionate and Desiring but he is

95
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:20,700
welfare and knowing with her own awareness the line of thinking that had Arisen and bahia's awareness so this

96
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,980
David knows what's going on but he is mine

97
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:32,580
but here the Deva went by here and on arrival said to him

98
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:38,640
you Bahia are neither awakened

99
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,459
nor have you even entered the path to Awakening you don't even have the

100
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:51,420
practice whereby you would become awakened or enter in the path of Awakening

101
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:57,140
you can imagine but he has like this wow okay

102
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:06,000
so there we go we have a Deva meeting at the Bahia in this suta

103
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,760
I don't know exactly what Devas are yes there's uh different ways we might understand them some of them have these

104
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,800
disembodied entities one thing that I do know that in all the

105
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,200
suit does teachings the Devas are just like humans in this sense that they are

106
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,140
not awakened either they're not completely they're not you know uh like they're not like other Buddhas or

107
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:37,800
something like this but something I appreciate very much and this is by Douglas Phillips who's

108
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:43,260
another Dharma teacher who teaches both in this tradition and in the Zen tradition

109
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:50,459
and the one way that he considers this Deva is by the

110
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:57,480
role that she plays rather than what exactly a data is what's the function in this story of

111
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:04,200
having a Deva come and meet Bahia and Douglas Phillips has this idea that

112
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,360
the Deva is the embodiment of feminine wisdom

113
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,660
of course I kind of like this being a woman myself I like this but there's a way in which we can

114
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,120
imagine sometimes uh there's this masculine side of us that's trying to go

115
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,220
get things make it happen and then there's this we might say right

116
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:33,000
this is a gross generalization of course right gross generalization and not accurate but it's a way we might think

117
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,560
about what the role of Davis is then there's also kind of this feminine wisdom that's like wait is that the only

118
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,139
thing that there is is this going and getting things

119
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,380
and she like challenges but here with this brutal honesty right this is kind of painful like she's just cuts to the

120
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,600
chase nope you're not awakened and you're not even gonna get awakened

121
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,940
so telling Bahia that despite his years of practice and despite he has all these

122
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:09,839
admiring students he's not even a beginner on the path

123
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,440
another way we might think of this idea of the feminine wisdom is that there's

124
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:23,820
sometimes making this distinction between masculine or feminine no matter which gender we are that there sometimes

125
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:32,639
are aspects of ourselves that we're cutting off a little bit that we're ignoring not paying attention to

126
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:40,079
we can just drop this idea of feminine or masculine there's just often parts of us that we are

127
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,899
trying to avoid that we're trying to you know pretend

128
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:53,040
aren't there and maybe even secretly wish that they'll go away so this is when Douglas Phillips is one

129
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,519
way that he's interpreting this Deva but no matter how we think about it we might

130
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,040
notice that maybe doubt has it risen in your

131
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,880
practice too maybe you've had some ideas like am I

132
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,399
doing this right everybody else seems like they're awakened or on the brink of awakenment

133
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:24,959
and I'm here struggling with uh being lost in thoughts or whatever it is that we might be

134
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:31,019
struggling with at the moment so we might have doubt about

135
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:38,459
our capacities we might have doubts about the teachings what's this idea of Divas

136
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:43,740
might have doubt about the teacher do they really know what they're talking about does she really know what she's

137
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:49,560
talking about or maybe we've had expectations about

138
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,680
you know the results of this practice we had this idea okay I'm just going to learn this meditation practice is

139
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:02,760
everything is going to be easier my life is going to be better and maybe it hasn't turned out exactly the

140
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:09,420
way that you were hoping or wanted it to be so maybe in some ways we're kind of like

141
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:15,360
Bahia but there's something here that what do

142
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,519
we do when we have these doubts for our practice or we have some indicators that

143
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:27,300
we still have some work to do there's two ways that we could do this

144
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:33,660
that we could approach this when this doubt arises one is to go down

145
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:40,620
the path of resignation self-judgment despair

146
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:46,199
bitterness blaming disdain like there's all kinds

147
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:51,959
of words I could use here and sometimes we might travel some distance down this path before we

148
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:57,180
realize this actually is leading to more suffering not to less suffering this

149
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:02,880
isn't making things better to have this blaming or

150
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,120
collapsing or resignation

151
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:13,860
that's one way to go chances are all of us do some version of that and I know I

152
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,740
certainly did certainly earlier in my practice I didn't I would just get angry at the

153
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:25,380
teachers these poor teachers they didn't know what I was projecting on to them like I just thought I don't know I just

154
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:31,800
thought it was their fault somehow that this was so hard and I didn't know how to do it or I was getting lost or having

155
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:38,880
difficulties I thought if they would only be better teachers now I'm one of those teachers right I

156
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,160
can tell you we don't have all the answers for everybody right we have to find our own

157
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:51,600
way of course we do of course we do and that's the second path or that's the

158
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,500
second response we could have when we have all this response when we discover that there's some difficulties

159
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,779
we could rather than the path of blaming or self-judgment we could go down the

160
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:10,918
path of practice that is we could bring attention to our

161
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:18,720
experience at that moment this is what doubt feels like

162
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:26,459
this is what blaming feels like this is what despair feels like

163
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:31,740
this is what feeling confused and angry and not even sure I want to do this

164
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:39,380
practice anymore feels like it feels like this and it's uncomfortable

165
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,500
so there's a way in which we can just bring our practice to our experience

166
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:53,720
which to be sure might be the precise thing we don't want to do

167
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,679
but this is what's been asked of us not to be somebody different not to have different experiences but to be with

168
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,260
what's arising as best we can

169
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,559
as best we can with whatever's arising

170
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:21,660
so if we do have some doubt about our not only our experience or about the teachings or the teachers what can we do

171
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:27,840
we can be with our experience but bring it with a sense of curiosity do some

172
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,840
investigation talk to a teacher read Dharma books listen to Dharma talks talk to other

173
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,960
people there's so many ways in which we can maybe share our experience in a way that

174
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,419
feels comfortable for us that is a part of the practice

175
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:52,200
I would say for me I certainly would not have stayed with this practice if it weren't for some friends that I had

176
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:59,220
along this dormant path to share kind of the difficulties and

177
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:06,720
after Derma talks to talk about things like what I didn't get it did you get it you know this kind of thing or to just

178
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,679
like share ideas

179
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:19,260
and maybe the last thing I'll say about this that's this when we're having difficulties to engage with the practice

180
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:26,720
and to bring some curiosity about it maybe some of you will recognize this as investigation

181
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,880
and many of you will know that investigation is a factor of Awakening like it's an

182
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:40,260
integral part of this path towards Awakening so it's not like something that we do on the side until we could

183
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:47,820
get back to the real practice it is the practice to bring some curiosity some

184
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,860
some just being present like what what's going on here

185
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:59,900
to what's actually happening okay to get back to the suta Bahia

186
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:05,880
so the David just told him okay you're not awakened and you're not even going to be awakened

187
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,179
and I give but he a lot of credit because here's what happens next

188
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:20,520
without hesitation Bahia asked the Deva but who in this world is awakened or has

189
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:26,460
entered the path to Awakening and she said Bahia

190
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:35,400
in the northern city of saviti lives the blessed one the Buddha a rightly self-awakened one he is truly

191
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,640
awakened and he teaches the Dharma that leads to Awakening

192
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,460
then but he had deeply chastened by the Deva left saparaka and traveled all the

193
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:54,419
way to where the Buddha was traveling with where the Buddha was staying put this in context this is thousands of

194
00:20:54,419 --> 00:21:02,100
years ago and the distance between where Bahia was and where the Buddha was it's over a thousand miles

195
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,500
right he had to walk right maybe he had a chariot part of the way or some of the way I don't know but

196
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:14,580
a thousand miles is a long time right before there's roads or Pavements not even it doesn't exist yet you know this

197
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:21,900
is but here he undergoes this he has his commitment and he's willing to travel this distance

198
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:29,220
in my mind this this uh in adding this little detail into the story is pointing

199
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:35,039
to the the amount of commitment that Bahia has like he really wants to get

200
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:42,240
awakened so

201
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:50,280
I uh so but he doesn't defend or rationalize uh his everybody else thinks

202
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:56,520
I'm awakened are you sure instead he says well if I don't have it where can I find it and then he goes to see if he

203
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:03,659
can find it so he travels to where the Buddha is and getting back to the sutta

204
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:09,120
there but he have found a number of monks doing walking meditation outside

205
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:17,460
he went directly up to them and asked where venerable sirs is the Buddha stain

206
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:25,640
I must see him immediately he has this you know urgency

207
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,559
and then he was told that the Buddha had gone into the city for Ohm's round right of course the monastics every day are

208
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:38,400
getting alms so the Buddha wasn't there the place where other monastics were he was in the

209
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,700
town so but he heard hurried immediately to the city where he found the Buddha on

210
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:50,100
alms round the Buddha was moving with great calm

211
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:55,200
his mind at peace tranquil and poised

212
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:02,220
this is how Buddhas are but he approached the Buddha threw

213
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:08,820
himself to the ground before him and with his head at the Buddha's feet he said teach me the Dharma blessed one

214
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:14,460
teach me the Dharma a holy one so that it will be for my long-term welfare and

215
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:20,220
happiness the Buddha replies this is not the time

216
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:25,559
by here we have entered the town for alms

217
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:32,640
so in an irreverent way in my mind he's saying if I'm on my lunch break I got

218
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,179
back later

219
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,020
I'm sure the Buddha would be a little bit different but you know that's kind of what happened right and recognizing

220
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:50,520
right that this time the Buddha only ate one time a day right so he needs to eat he needs to have a meal every day

221
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,580
but but he have pleaded with the Buddha a second time but holy one it is hard to

222
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:01,799
know for sure what dangers there may be for the Buddha's life or what dangers

223
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:06,900
there may be for my life please teach me the Dharma o blessed one

224
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:13,200
so that I may be happy and free so be a Bahia say no no no teach me now

225
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,260
because you know we don't know what's going to happen in the next moment

226
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:25,559
again the boo that but Buddha tried to put off Bahia and he's saying that it wasn't the right

227
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:32,159
time to teach because this is the alms round so but he is persistent

228
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,380
he has a certain amount of diligence but he also recognizes you know

229
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,900
impermanence this recognition that you know we're not guaranteed a next moment

230
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:48,059
none of us are not even Buddhas

231
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:53,820
even though we might be thinking okay I'll be doing this later later everything will be fine later I'll figure that out later I'll practice

232
00:24:53,820 --> 00:25:00,419
later I'll be with my present moment experience but here has enough wisdom to recognize no

233
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:06,140
we don't actually know what's going to happen the next moment

234
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:12,740
so he's but he is respectful but tenacious

235
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:22,620
so the suta continues Bahia pleaded his case a third time

236
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:29,820
and this is a common theme that we see in the suit does it's very interesting and I don't know the origins or the

237
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:36,900
story around this but common that if you ask a Buddha three times after the third time he will

238
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,299
relent just keep that in your back pocket the next time you meet a Buddha you can ask

239
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:45,740
them three times for something

240
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,880
Bahia pleaded his case a third time and this time the Buddha relented and said

241
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:00,320
well then you should train like this

242
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:07,980
in the scene will be merely the scene in the scene in

243
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,740
The Herd will be merely The Herd

244
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:19,740
in the sensed will be merely the sensed

245
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:26,299
in the cognized will be merely the cognized

246
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:35,480
so that Buddha is pointing to just being with the present moment experience

247
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,799
cognized we could have that stand for all whatever mental events are happening

248
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:47,400
in the mind sensed we could say that as a shorthand for any senses

249
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,440
in in addition to seeing and hearing

250
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,960
so when seeing or hearing is happening just to be only Syrian or hearing or

251
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,940
sensing or having mental events

252
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:10,140
we might say that a big part of practice is discovering

253
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:15,840
all the extra quote unquote things that we do besides just being with our

254
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,840
experience sometimes the experience is uncomfortable

255
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,659
and then as we spoke about earlier there might be this but I don't want it to be

256
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:33,659
here and then there's a whole story making that happens many of you might be familiar with this

257
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:39,539
idea of papancha right this mental proliferation that often starts with something's really Pleasant or

258
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:46,500
unpleasant then there's a way in which the Mind wants more and it starts to make a story about how it wants more I

259
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:53,640
want this or I don't want that or this reminds me of the time that you

260
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,279
know XYZ or this means something about me this often happens right and then

261
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,559
we're no longer with the present moment instead we're with what's off lost in

262
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,720
our stories so the Buddha is pointing to the

263
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,720
importance of just staying with the present moment experience

264
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:22,700
so then the suta continues it's more than just being with the present moment experience

265
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:32,520
that Buddha says and when you have trained in that way and the scene will be merely this scene and the herd will

266
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,860
be merely the herd and this sensed will be merely the sensed in the cognized

267
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:45,539
will be merely the cognized then be here there is no you

268
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:51,179
in connection with that and when there is no you

269
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:58,200
in connection with that there is no you there and when there is no you there there is

270
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,759
no you here nor Yonder nor in between

271
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:11,299
and just this is the end of suffering

272
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:18,899
upon hearing this brief explanation from the Buddha but he is mind was immediately freed from the defilements

273
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:25,559
from grasping and he became an our hunt so you might wait I wonder like wait

274
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:32,159
what what happened there what the Buddha is pointing to is that

275
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,880
imputina a sense of self or having this self-concept

276
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:45,080
is extra and it's associated with suffering

277
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,000
so we might consider like the Buddha's description of when the scene is just

278
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:58,080
the scene or the hearing is just the hearing might be a description of what it means when there isn't this

279
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,779
self-concept that's getting overlaid on top of our experience

280
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:10,799
it's this idea of that there is a there's a pattern of experience but

281
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:19,140
there's no entanglement with it there's no papancha that's happening after it

282
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:24,360
as an example you might have noticed that sometimes

283
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:30,360
during meditation sessions the most

284
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,760
peaceful the most delightful

285
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:44,880
part of the whole meditation session is when the bell rings at the end

286
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,899
because at that moment like there's a little huh and there's any doing that had was being

287
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:58,500
done like there's a meditator here that's trying to meditate or I'm meditating for that moment when the bell

288
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:05,820
rings that sense of oh I I quote unquote have to meditate gets put down

289
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:11,279
there's this kind of this relaxation this a little bit of a just an opening

290
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:18,360
like oh okay now what's next I finished that but before there's the I finished

291
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:24,779
that that moment there's this this can be this peacefulness that the next meditation session notice what happens

292
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:30,360
at the moment when the bell rings there often is this opening this relaxation

293
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,380
this ease

294
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:41,760
because at that time there's like the mind isn't like doing anything you're not trying to meditate you're not trying

295
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,840
to be a meditator nothing needs to happen right at that moment and it might just be a flash or a flicker

296
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:57,740
but just notice how at that time there's this peacefulness or this delightfulness

297
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:04,080
but not only is there no longer this sense of somebody who's doing this

298
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,360
meditation but at that moment also the reactivity

299
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,440
and the measuring has been quieted or dropped

300
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,260
there's often such a subtle way in fact it might be subtle and so constant and

301
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:27,620
familiar we might not even recognize it but there's a way when often when we're

302
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:32,940
meditating or we're trying to meditate there's this subtle way in which there's

303
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:39,360
a I like this more than that

304
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:45,779
oh it was better yesterday what am I going to do tomorrow so I can

305
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:51,059
have this experience again or I don't like this as much as that right

306
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:57,059
there's this subtle measuring or comparing or a sense of me trying to

307
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:04,460
make things happen that gets tangled up with our experience

308
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:12,899
and what the Buddha is pointing to is that's extra we don't actually have to do that

309
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:20,100
that doesn't need to happen in fact that can get quieter and quieter and quieter

310
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:25,500
and usually this is how it happens is it's this x doing that extra is on a

311
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:32,760
spectrum sometimes it's so obvious like I don't like this please make it go away I hate this when is that tank Bell gonna

312
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:39,240
ring and there can be a really strong sense of I want something in particular to

313
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,399
happen or there it could be a really quiet

314
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:51,419
just every now and then there's a thought that floats up like oh yeah this is nice I hope it stays like this wow

315
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:57,779
look at me I'm meditating there can be something like this it can be really really strong or really really

316
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:06,720
subtle it's not a binary on or off when this uh this extra is added

317
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,618
so this reactivity this um measuring this entanglement

318
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:19,378
is caused we might say by the self-concept that there's this

319
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:26,820
idea of a self that because the self it wants things to be a particular way

320
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:32,118
wants things to be pleasant and comfortable

321
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:41,398
and it's this way of trying to bolster and protect this notion of this core or

322
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:48,658
this notion of an essence that underlies suffering

323
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:54,898
and whether that's suffering is just stress or uncomfortableness or just flat

324
00:34:54,899 --> 00:35:00,359
out awfulness it's this self-concept at the beginning

325
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:06,480
at the this at the sense of this being at the core that is the source that's

326
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,079
fueling the reactivity it's fueling the suffering

327
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,359
so whatever is happening

328
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:27,320
and whatever moment and each moment whatever is happening

329
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,359
this can be the entry point of practice

330
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,500
learning to live fully in the life that we have

331
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:45,720
not in some imagined future or remembered past but living to just be

332
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:53,838
here oh yeah this is sensing feels like this

333
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,640
seeing seeing is like this hearing

334
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:04,680
hearing is like this whether you're in a meditative stage

335
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:11,460
whether you're in a meditation posture whether you're just washing the dishes or driving or whatever it might be whatever

336
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,700
your experiences this can be a doorway to practice

337
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,200
and just to be with the seeing or the hearing or

338
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:30,960
whatever mental experience is happening and freedom is possible Right There at

339
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,000
that moment we don't have to wait for some imagined

340
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,640
you know perfect conditions whatever is happening right there we can be with the

341
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:48,359
experience and maybe it's just a moment a flicker of a little bit more ease

342
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:53,400
but this is exactly how the practice unfolds is with a tasting or a

343
00:36:53,400 --> 00:37:00,000
recognition of oh yeah there's a little bit more ease this direction when I'm just with the experience there's less

344
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,520
ease this direction when I'm adding on all the thoughts and ideas of how I

345
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,460
should be or how this experience should be

346
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:20,960
so being with our experience and the life we actually have

347
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,440
can be the doorway to Greater freedom thank you

348
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:36,780
so I wish you all a wonderful rest of the day and happy Father's Day again

349
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:43,940
and if you'd like I'll stay up here for a few moments if you'd like to ask some questions thank you
