1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,559
so hello everyone and

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,359
and perhaps i can welcome you to the beginning of the week start of a new

3
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,480
week for many of us and

4
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,559
it's nice to start it here so um one of the

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,360
sometimes it said that one of the first lessons that are useful to learn if you start

6
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,960
meditating is the importance of patience

7
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,879
and sooner or later meditators learn patience

8
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,160
learn a variety of different ways by which to

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,520
not give in to forces of stress or judgment or

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:17,040
frustration or discouragement or

11
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,320
because sooner or later we'll find that the mind has a mind of its own that it

12
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,360
has strong impulses strong patterns of thinking that

13
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,520
and and rather than fighting it there is some sooner or later a patience

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,000
a willingness to steadily calmly work with it practice with it

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,399
not to collapse around what we discover what happens with our emotions our thoughts or

16
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,960
our attitudes our challenges we have and there's many different forms of

17
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,159
patients and uh discovering some of the different

18
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,200
flavors of patients is part of what can be quite wonderful

19
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,480
as we practice over a long extended period of time

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,760
so today to sit with patients sit with patients with all things that

21
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,520
are unresolved in your life to be patient with

22
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,440
the challenges that you could show up as you meditate not to

23
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,480
have a version to it or disrespect it to dismiss it but not to succumb to stress

24
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,080
around having it not to succumb to aversion

25
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,959
or not to succumb to pressure to change it and fix it

26
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:00,120
but rather the patience that allows us to be still and quiet and attentive

27
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,680
attentively quietly recognizing what is actually happening

28
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,440
for us what is it we have what is it that we is happening

29
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,000
that gives us reason for patience and to sit quietly in the middle of that

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,640
breathe with it sense it feel it without getting caught up in fixing and thinking

31
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,720
and analyzing just as quiet abiding in the midst of what's actually

32
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,640
happening a serious recognition serious

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,239
engagement with our life through this wonderful avenue

34
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:51,040
of quiet abiding in the midst of what arises

35
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,799
so assuming a meditation posture

36
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,560
and

37
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,720
perhaps relaxing your gaze

38
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,040
maybe letting your eyes gaze downward

39
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,320
and relaxed soft

40
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,040
and if it's comfortable to close your eyes you could close

41
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,040
gently

42
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,479
and if it's comfortable to take some gentle but deeper

43
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,400
breaths that expands the rib cage

44
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,840
maybe deep enough that it lifts the shoulders a bit

45
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,560
deep enough that if you have a back rest or your back is up

46
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,600
against some surface you feel the pressure

47
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,280
if you breathe in against that surface the back ribcage

48
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,280
and letting your breathing return to normal

49
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,639
on the exhale

50
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:05,440
to relax whatever's tension or stress that's easy to soften relax

51
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,840
unwind

52
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:19,800
a kind of releasing throughout the body as you exhale

53
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:53,280
perhaps if it's comfortable for you you can imagine that as you breathe

54
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:02,080
that the breathing the energy of breathing the sensations

55
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,360
are breathing move through the whole body

56
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,599
maybe as if you're not breathing through the nose or the mouth but you're breathing through the whole

57
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,080
body in and out

58
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:43,599
and as you exhale softening the mind

59
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,639
relaxing the pressure to think the contraction of

60
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,639
thinking

61
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,319
if you think in words slowing the words down in the mind

62
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,840
if you think in images slowing the images

63
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:40,080
and if there's a lot of feelings emotions maybe there's some place like the heart

64
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,919
maybe the hands the belly

65
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,000
that you can relax a bit soften

66
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,920
and now to center yourself on the breathing

67
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,279
the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

68
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,720
and perhaps the ongoing rhythm of breathing

69
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,080
staying close to it will help you

70
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,040
to be patient

71
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,839
with whatever goes on during meditation

72
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:01,600
that might be difficult perhaps staying close to your breathing

73
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,639
and breathing through it

74
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,519
or staying centered and grounded with breathing

75
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:28,360
remembering to be patient with all things one breath at a time

76
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,519
um

77
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,360
what could you be patient about now

78
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:50,000
that would support you to be here quieter stiller

79
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,759
attentive not reactive

80
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:33,080
and perhaps the gentle rhythm of breathing can support you to be patient

81
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,279
so then as we come to the end of the sitting

82
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:48,240
perhaps we can dedicate some of the benefit from sitting and meditating

83
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:56,000
the known benefits and the unknown benefits dedicated for the welfare of the world

84
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,159
for the benefit of others perhaps if we're more patient for

85
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,159
meditating

86
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,840
we can be more patient with other people

87
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,880
more patient with their shortcomings their challenges

88
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,240
more patient as they find their way in this difficult life

89
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:36,080
they're kind of giving more room for people to be without them being the recipient

90
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,200
of our stress of our reactivity

91
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,240
our impatience

92
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:55,760
may it be through this practice that patience is much more than patience

93
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,720
it's a gift

94
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,960
in being able to be present for people as they are

95
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:12,640
free of our projections our needs our reactions

96
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:22,000
may through this practice of mindfulness may our attention to others

97
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,799
be a gift

98
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:36,080
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

99
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,279
may all beings be peaceful

100
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,200
may all beings be free

101
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,640
and may our patients support that possibility

102
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:14,160
[Music]

103
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,398
thank you

104
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:44,480
so here we are first day of the week monday

105
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,720
first day for our next series and uh for these five days

106
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:58,080
i would like to uh spend our time reflecting thinking about focusing on

107
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,279
patients the poly word for patients kanti

108
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:09,600
h a t k h a n t i

109
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,880
um shanti in sanskrit

110
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,720
it's a really rich word and perhaps as rich as the word patience

111
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,399
but it's multifaceted and it's a relevant

112
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:31,519
the very start of doing buddhist practice as i said

113
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,880
meditation you have to if you don't learn patience quickly meditation is going to be much harder

114
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,320
than it needs to be and uh it's also uh

115
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:50,080
characterizes some of the deepest insights some of the deepest places to abide in to dwell in

116
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:56,799
in meditation but there's a kind of a something that's called kanti something that's called patience

117
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,799
and so there's many forms of patience and i'll talk about different ones

118
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,840
and over these five days and um

119
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,720
the um but patience is needed

120
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,080
not because it's just a virtue you always just practice it because it's good to do

121
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:26,320
but patience is a response or a practice to things that are challenging

122
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,440
and so when we get reactive in ways that are unhealthy for us and

123
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:38,000
not healthy for others sometimes patience is a better um

124
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,200
better response than anger or resentment or being stressed or

125
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:51,679
being kind of getting tense around what's happening and so this capacity to appreciate the

126
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:58,159
value of patients and understand how it enhances us brings out the best in us as opposed to

127
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,200
patients with a damp it dampens us down or represses us in some way and

128
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:10,159
and uh is actually adds stress to the system rather than freeze it to it

129
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:16,000
so um today i want to talk a little bit about um

130
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:22,840
i'll tell you the five themes of patients for the week the first today is going to be

131
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,399
um patience which is being staying true

132
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:34,000
under stress staying true to ourselves under stress

133
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,399
tomorrow it's gentle perseverance under

134
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:45,679
difficulties under challenges wednesday will be

135
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:52,399
patients under insult things that happen in the in our life how people treat us

136
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:59,039
to be patient with the insults and so what does that mean and then

137
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,278
thursday will be forgiveness

138
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,760
when insulted and so how's that healthy how is that done in a healthy way

139
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,000
and then um friday is the kind of the deepest form of patience and the word kanti is used for this and

140
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,679
whether patience is the right word in english or not but this has to do with a certain

141
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:29,280
very deep patience with the some of the deepest truths that we

142
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,040
can touch into through buddhist practice some of the deepest realization insights

143
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,158
that are you know it sounds wonderful to have insights um deep realizations but

144
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:46,398
some of them are challenging to have and so to develop patients around these these

145
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:52,878
these things which are phenomenally true but but you know it's challenging to do

146
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,160
so for example we can realize at some point i have insight and realization at some

147
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,599
point of the possibility of not clinging to anything

148
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:10,960
but then we end up clinging a lot so how do we and and uh and it can be frightening this idea that let go of to

149
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,640
really not cling and so to be patient to be accepting to be

150
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,760
somehow some kind of healthy tolerance for this truth that clinging is not

151
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:29,119
worthwhile so today the topic is being true under stress

152
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,480
and what i mean by this and this is particularly meant for people who i'm thinking in my mind i'm thinking about

153
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,480
people have some kind of ongoing spiritual practice like meditation practice

154
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,400
that at some point we start uh having access or

155
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,760
start experiencing a way of being that feels true feels truer

156
00:35:51,760 --> 00:36:00,400
than being greedy being hateful being tense a lot being afraid a lot

157
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,920
is truer than kind of being lost in fantasy and spinning around in thoughts

158
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,960
and when when the thoughts quiet down when we feel more connected to ourselves more subtle on ourselves when we're not

159
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,960
ahead of ourselves not behind ourselves we're not not when we're not kind of carrying the weight of

160
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:25,920
the world on our shoulders um that then we can feel like oh now i'm more

161
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,680
myself i'm more alive i'm more connected there's something here which feels true

162
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:38,560
and honest and so to connect to this honesty to this true way of being

163
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:44,000
so it could just be maybe i'm talking a little bit in grand terms it could be

164
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,280
that something like meditation just helps us to be calmer a little bit and then uh and that feels right to not

165
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,760
to the calm feels a little bit commerce feels better than being agitated

166
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:05,200
and so there's a reference point something that feels healthy and good and desirable a way of being

167
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:11,200
and so to be patient is this for people have access to that

168
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:17,119
is to stay true to it in stressful situations and um

169
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:23,040
there's a lot of you know infinite number of situations we might find ourselves in that are stressful

170
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,240
it could be the most mundane it could be that we're late for the dentist

171
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:35,359
and and so we feel we have to rush and be anxious and worry but we know that when we rush and worry

172
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:41,839
that way that we actually lose touch with what's true about ourselves something that's true or connected or

173
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,440
real or valuable way of being and so maybe so to be patient

174
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,359
is to not give in to that rush not give in to the the thoughts of worry that are spinning

175
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,280
stories and stories but to be patient with ourselves

176
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,760
is to stay true to what we know is there and what this means is that for people who don't have access to some way of

177
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:13,040
being that feels like right way of being or better or satisfying way of being

178
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:20,240
then patience might seem like just a a um a you know i don't know

179
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:26,720
an obligation it's like a work you know now i have to work at this too being patient and

180
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,560
and it's just kind of a drag because it's just like imposing a certain kind of virtue on top of us

181
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:39,359
but if we know something that's valuable if we know a way of being that's healthy and good

182
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,359
then to be patient is not to give that up

183
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:53,040
easily and not to easily succumb to the temptation to be angry the temptation to be worried

184
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:00,800
temptation to want things to be different and the impulse strong kind of movements of

185
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:08,640
impatience that might be there and so to give give let go of the impatience

186
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,880
so that we can stay closer to what we feel is valuable and at ease

187
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,480
and and uh and so

188
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:26,000
and sometimes this idea of patience has less to do with a way of being

189
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,839
patient as it is letting go of the impatience whatever that

190
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:38,800
is the forces of impatience so that we can be something that feels innate and healthy

191
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:45,760
and good not to hold on to it not to construct something but let go into something deeper that we have

192
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,200
so one of the exercises you might think of that goes along with what i'm saying today

193
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:57,599
is when you meditate and maybe you want to maybe meditate a little extra this week

194
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:04,720
so you can do this exercise it doesn't have to be long a 10-minute meditation and

195
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:12,319
is to um when you finish your meditation if you're a little calmer or more subtle

196
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:18,319
than you were before more connected then

197
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:23,359
get up from that meditation and stay very carefully attentive

198
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:28,480
to when you begin losing that calm losing that subtleness

199
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,839
and when you do stop in your tracks and

200
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:40,400
maybe can you close your eyes and check in with yourself and see what just happened here

201
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:47,920
and did anything happen here that was a symptom of impatience

202
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,960
and what would it and maybe could i come back since it just happened

203
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,119
just a few moments ago that i started to get tense or hurried can i settle back

204
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,160
into this place of calm or subtleness what i'm calling

205
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,680
and this is what i call being true under stress so there might be good

206
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,119
reasons to start hurrying and rushing and getting tense but it's not necessarily the best thing

207
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,640
to do even if the reasons are there the results of being stressful is stressed

208
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:32,000
and doing these reactive things is we're less wise we're less involved more forgetful more easy to make mistakes

209
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,040
and sometimes when we don't have to redo things uh because we stay calm and do them carefully the first time

210
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,960
it's actually more efficient so try this exercise when you come out of

211
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,280
meditation maybe even today and after this talk

212
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:58,400
is notice when you begin losing some subtleness or calm

213
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:06,400
and then see what would it be like to be patient would it be like to be true to yourself

214
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,680
under stress so first type of patience

215
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,839
being true on staying true under stress

216
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,599
so um i hope that as we go through um these

217
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:30,720
five different kinds of patients that uh it's kind of a little journey for all of us into kind of a deeper and

218
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,160
deeper dimension of of um this parts of our lives

219
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,480
so thank you and i look forward to being here tomorrow
