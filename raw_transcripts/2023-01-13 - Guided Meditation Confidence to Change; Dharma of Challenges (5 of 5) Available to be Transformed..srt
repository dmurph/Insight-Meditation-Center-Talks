1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:08,340
this so my friends the here we are again

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,980
end of the week and I'm aware that the theme of the week

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,920
is practicing with challenges and

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,000
uh one of the really important

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,079
components of a healthy approach to challenges is confidence

6
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:39,420
to have confidence in oneself to have confidence in the practice so it's not

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,579
just oneself and um

8
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:51,000
and part of what makes challenges difficult is a lack of confidence like a kind of a helplessness hopelessness

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,879
feeling can't be done feeling that we're going to be overwhelmed by a situation

10
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,180
and certainly there are ways in which we cannot stop tidal waves coming sometimes

11
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:11,700
but uh but there it makes a difference if we can meet them with Dharma confidence the

12
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,900
confidence in the practice and there's many components of this kind of confidence and many aspects of how it

13
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,140
would play out in the real world but for now I want to offer one

14
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,180
and that is to an attitude of being

15
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,900
available to be changed in a healthy way

16
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:44,000
to be available for what's happening always ready

17
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,439
so that there's not a shield up we're not closed up we're not lost in our

18
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,479
thoughts and our fears and our doubts but a kind of openness

19
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,979
a kind of uh

20
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:07,380
counterphobic where we what's the challenge comes rather than stepping away we in internally at least not maybe

21
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,140
physically but internally we step towards okay I'm available for this

22
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,959
and I'm available to be changed what is this what is what is needed

23
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,420
from me what is what useful ways can I now

24
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,660
let go show up invoke positive qualities

25
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:38,420
How can I enter this as a practice opportunity what's the practice here

26
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:46,319
and even if the and how not to meet the challenge and already have lost before it has

27
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,739
arrived or before it's over so

28
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,980
to be available to have confidence to bring the practice of attention

29
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,500
the practice of available awareness that's there for

30
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:11,599
what's coming is the proposal for this morning's meditation

31
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,860
so to gently

32
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,340
take some time to enter into your posture

33
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,560
if it's comfortable close your eyes

34
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:48,659
and already from the start in inner stance and inner attitude

35
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:54,120
of being available to what is

36
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:02,340
by discovering it knowing it recognizing what is this experience I'm having Here

37
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,580
and Now through my body

38
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,799
to be available to feel the tensions of the body

39
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,360
without preconceived ideas or attitudes about what it means to have tensions

40
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,940
just to feel it to be available

41
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,220
for a discovery here now

42
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,880
availability that also makes room for the tensions to relax

43
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,960
partly on their own when they are known

44
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:21,320
and then being available to how the body experiences breathing

45
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:32,280
putting aside attitudes beliefs about breathing and mindfulness of

46
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:39,360
breathing in favor of recognizing how it is the body is experiencing

47
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,940
breathing now

48
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:12,440
and to have confidence in mindfulness confidence and awareness

49
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,419
is to appreciate that it's quite significant value and valuable

50
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:26,880
to meet whatever is happening with a clear recognition clear awareness

51
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,319
and clear knowing

52
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:40,280
without needing to fix anything or change anything

53
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,319
just be present for breathing

54
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:03,060
the attitude of availability is closely connected to being receptive

55
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:12,080
to experience receptive to the body breathing

56
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:31,879
relaxing any way in which you're asserting yourself

57
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:39,139
With Attitudes beliefs trying to do things make things be different

58
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,839
foreign

59
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,380
foreign

60
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,940
thank you foreign

61
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,759
all right

62
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,539
to meditate calling upon your confidence

63
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:29,160
in the practice confidence of an honest

64
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,640
clear awareness

65
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,440
of the present moment

66
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:47,960
without getting into thoughts and Analysis

67
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:53,120
commentary just aware

68
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:07,340
and with whatever confidence you have in the practice

69
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,179
to relax in such a way that you're available

70
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:20,299
to be changed to be freed

71
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,220
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

72
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:38,520
turn towards whatever confidence you have in the practice

73
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:46,820
confidence of being present to whatever might come

74
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,820
and turning towards an availability

75
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,640
to be a refuge for others

76
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:06,740
your availability to be a safe person for others

77
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,320
where for certain times right now you don't have to be protecting yourself

78
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:23,960
and making yourself safe but you're available

79
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,500
to be a refuge her friend

80
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,460
for others

81
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,039
and then to turn your attention outward

82
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:55,140
maybe in preparation for beginning to re-engage in the world of

83
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,539
people and animals and

84
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:10,740
this Earth and to consider how to enter back in

85
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,799
to the world with a confidence and availability

86
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,379
in openness a receptivity

87
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:32,658
and a wish to be safe from caring for others

88
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:39,299
may all beings be happy

89
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:44,000
may all beings be safe

90
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:53,419
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

91
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,559
[Music]

92
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,919
thank you

93
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:31,620
so hello everyone and Welcome to our fifth talk on the Dharma

94
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:37,620
of challenges and this talk and last week talk and

95
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:43,620
and if I think about it maybe the last four weeks of topics

96
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:50,220
have a kind of uh background for or laying the foundation for what's

97
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:56,820
going to come which is talking about the challenges that we have and how we

98
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:02,340
can address it with the Dharma with practice with mindfulness

99
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:09,600
and um and hopefully the things we've done in December there was a lot of talk about

100
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,559
the positive states of practice that those acts actually part of this Foundation of now looking at challenges

101
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:24,900
more and um and Following last week

102
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:30,240
what is the Dharma last Friday I talked about the Dharma

103
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:38,580
being Dharma as transformation that Dharma and is not just a it's not

104
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,620
just a set of teachings it's not just a practice but it's also the

105
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:48,659
transformation that's the beneficial change that comes about through the

106
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:53,760
practice and through finding in the practice the

107
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,880
healthy appropriate attitude with which to meet life to be with life

108
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:06,600
so um in the uh about three weeks ago or so I gave a

109
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:13,500
talk on these five beneficial States for listening to the Dharma hearing it be

110
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,980
people when people were in these states the Buddha would recognize it then he would teach them the Dharma that was

111
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:25,020
transformative that would change them and this is to have a mind that's bright

112
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:30,419
inspired to have a mind that is receptive or ready

113
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:37,500
to have to be free of hindrances to be malleable pliable workable to have a

114
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,779
malleable soft mind and

115
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:49,740
so the city of being soft and receptive and available to be changed is such an

116
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,020
important attitude for our life and it's easy to have a simplistic and

117
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:00,480
obvious and sometimes important attitude that would know that I can't do that I

118
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,080
have to protect myself I have to defend myself I have to take care of myself I can't just be available I'll be taking

119
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:13,919
advantage of and to some degree that's true and we have to be do this wisely

120
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:20,279
but uh as the our wisdom and confidence grows about how to be in the world

121
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:25,679
that without harming ourselves through our clinging through our anger through

122
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,159
our ill will hostility through our greed

123
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:39,419
Envy all kinds of things that we do that we learn how to be in the midst of

124
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:45,620
challenges while being available for change and

125
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:50,820
to be changed so one of the really I think clear for

126
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:57,000
me representations of this is the idea of dialogue with others how to be in

127
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,240
dialogue how to be in a productive not just discussion about something but dialogue for me means you're addressing

128
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,299
some theme some ideas some concern exploring something whether it's exploring a conflict you

129
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:15,600
have or exploring some Dharma idea that in a dialogue that it's not if

130
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:22,380
we're only about convincing other people that we're right then we're not available to be changed

131
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:29,340
and you still might be right and maybe you'll stay right but that doesn't mean you can't be

132
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:35,940
available to be transformed to be changed by the other person to hear new ideas to hear

133
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:43,260
them in a different way to understand to expand your horizons so you understand well I am right but this person also has

134
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:50,159
something they're adding something they're not taking it away it's not either or and available to be changed available to

135
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:56,340
learn something new and without a dialogue without that good availability I don't think it's really

136
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:04,679
dialogue it might be just a spouting opinions and it might be mostly trying to it's

137
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:09,720
mostly a debate um but to be available to be in dialogue

138
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:16,020
with its attitude how can I how can I learn something here and is there something more I can learn or

139
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:21,059
you know what can I do so so this availability to be changed to be

140
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:27,120
transformed in a beneficial way and it was relevant for me just before

141
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:33,059
we started this uh meditation that the technology wasn't

142
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:38,640
working here when I sat down and so I had to call for help from someone and

143
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:45,419
we're trying to figure it out then and normally in the minutes before uh we're sitting networks I start here I'm

144
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:50,640
getting ready and a little bit getting my thoughts in in organized and what

145
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,580
we're going to talk about but today I really couldn't do it much because of the dealing with the technology and

146
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:02,340
getting things set up properly and um and but I was kind of happy uh

147
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:08,760
because I said oh this is a challenge I'm not being able to do it how I usually want to do it but um

148
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,799
but let's see what happens here now let's see what arises this is happening

149
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:20,279
and I'm available for what comes next I'm available to see how this unfolds or

150
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:25,679
what arises out of this and um and so rather than being kind of

151
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:32,220
concerned about you know or distressed around you know maybe we're not going to get the sound system working in time for

152
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:39,000
the 7 A.M and all these people will be sitting there and um you know waiting and I have you know

153
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,679
we're supposed to start on time um I certainly wanted to try to be on time and be available be here but it was

154
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:51,840
I also had this kind of curiosity or this availability okay this is how it is

155
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:58,080
now and um I don't need to stress I don't need to

156
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,600
get you know any to have any kind of fear

157
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:10,980
let's just see and so this essence of availability uh uh made the whole thing you know

158
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:18,419
easier than it could have been how much more pleasant than it could have been it was it was nice it was a you know and it

159
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:26,159
was wonderful to receive my friends support uh and to feel generosity of helping making it out as problem solved

160
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:33,779
so um the um to be available to be transformed

161
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:41,340
it's essential for doing Dharma practice and and so because it's so important

162
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:47,580
uh we want to understand what gets in the way of being

163
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:53,039
transformed what why we're kind of stuck why we're protected why we're resisting

164
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:58,460
or shut down or closed up or why we're

165
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:04,320
insisting that we're right or insisting has to be at my way and you know the um

166
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,419
what's going on for us and so the reference point this the standard

167
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:15,540
um that I want to be available to be transformed to be changed by the situation

168
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:21,480
to be freed by it I can't do that I'm not doing that

169
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:28,138
that's interesting and so keep that in mind you know am I available to be changed am I available to be transformed

170
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:33,898
by this am I available to be freed by it and then we start discovering maybe we

171
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:40,980
don't have a lot of confidence maybe we don't have a lot of um sense of safety we don't have a we're

172
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:47,878
you know we're afraid we're assertive we want something and uh and then to not just take that

173
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:53,460
for granted not to accept it as a given but to put a question mark next to it do

174
00:34:53,460 --> 00:35:00,599
I really need this to be this way is there another way uh is there another way of being safe is

175
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:07,320
there another way of caring for this situation is there another way of of protecting myself that's not shutting

176
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,960
down is there a way of you know what can I what do I have to let go of to be

177
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:20,400
available this is such an important question because so many times what we have to do

178
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:27,119
is to let go of something we're attached to let go of some excessive

179
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:34,380
and I'm just underlined excessive self-preoccupation in such a way that we let go of it

180
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:42,260
it feels like a relief in the moment in and of itself something that was closed or tight or stressed

181
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:47,880
softens let's go we might feel more vulnerable because of that

182
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:54,599
and so then we have to figure out how to be with our vulnerability maybe we have to have effective ways of

183
00:35:54,599 --> 00:36:00,420
protecting ourselves or but I have to do some cautious things maybe not be in

184
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,299
certain situations or not talk about certain things

185
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:12,240
um but we're not closing down we're not shutting down or resisting we're just taking care of ourselves

186
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:19,200
while we're available and it open caring way for ourselves

187
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:27,240
so um the Dharma as transformation it is here to transform us in a

188
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:35,339
beneficial way it is here to free us from the stresses the distresses the

189
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:40,760
fears the the way that we often live under

190
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:47,400
there is this is a path of Liberation and Liberation is a transformation

191
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:53,240
and if you want to follow this path to develop the confidence and the love for

192
00:36:53,240 --> 00:37:00,480
being available to be transformed and to hear Dharma teachings and read

193
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,720
books on Dharma and not read it to for it to reinforce our own opinions

194
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,820
but maybe it's nice it's it you know supports how we understand things but

195
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:18,180
not to like lob onto that actually be willing to be challenged by what we read

196
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,339
and what we hear question it the more unless we agree with it the more

197
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:28,440
valuable it is for us to engage in a deeper reflection and what's happening

198
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:36,780
here what's going on and rather than quickly coming to a judgment oh this is right this is wrong

199
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:42,300
so in Dharma life to have the confidence to always be

200
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:48,660
looking always be seeing where is the opening where is the possibility where's the doorway here

201
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:55,680
to be Freer where is it to be available to be transformed to let go of something

202
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:02,160
to bring forth available to bring forth some of the beauty Beauty that's in our

203
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:11,160
hearts available to let our friendliness our kindness our love to be present

204
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:17,700
and how to be available for challenges not only so that would be changed by

205
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:23,099
them but also can we can be changed by what's best the best qualities of our

206
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:29,240
own hearts to be available here to see what goodness can come out

207
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:35,820
in the context of our confidence are a kind of a strength

208
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:41,339
and um without allowing the good in us to come forth

209
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:49,380
then maybe challenges can't transform Us in other ways

210
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:55,800
so um the Dharma of challenges and the willingness to be changed the

211
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:03,780
willingness to be transformed and this is part of the art of Dharma practice because the Dharma is partly

212
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:11,940
what it is partly is a transformation process a liberate liberating process

213
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:18,660
all in its own time trusting the process so uh thank you

214
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:25,980
for this and um you might see in the course of this next time until Monday

215
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:33,300
um this notion of being available to be changed both by the external world but also by

216
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:39,660
your internal world What comes forth how often are you available and how

217
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:45,660
often are you going about your day in a way actually you're not gonna you're not you're not really available

218
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:50,820
you're like just insisting on everything being this way or busy in such a way that

219
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:56,040
it's only one way to do it what would be like to go through your day

220
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:02,400
noticing when you're available to be changed and when you're not

221
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,820
and what do you learn through that so thank you

222
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:16,200
very very much and I appreciate this chance to explore this with you and I hope that I haven't anything I've said

223
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:23,280
hasn't disrespected how difficult some of your challenges are that make it seem like it's too you know

224
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:30,119
easy or simple to do to be with them but uh maybe as we learn to work with a

225
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:35,280
this the smaller challenges of a life we're preparing ourselves to be

226
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,800
available and and uh and know how to address the large ones

227
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,320
so thank you and I look forward to continuing Monday

228
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,980
thank you
