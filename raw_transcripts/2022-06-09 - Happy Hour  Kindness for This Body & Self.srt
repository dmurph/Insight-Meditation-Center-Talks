00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,400
so for today's practice together um

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:22,240
i thought we would do some simple meta together some exploration of simple meta together

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,080
and uh see what arises see what arises so

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,760
so um let's see if there's anything i want to say to

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:41,120
frame this maybe maybe what i would say is um meta loving kindness

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,680
practicing kindness acceptance care

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,280
arose by any name is just as sweet so

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,480
so many different nuances different ways for

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,760
this quality of meta-friendliness warmth to be to be expressed

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:12,400
and today what i'd like to do is actually to start with our bodies to turn

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,000
and share some spacious care some spacious care

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,320
for this body that is ours that is ours and not ours

and as thoughts arise as they will inevitably arise not a problem

48
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,919
see if we can open our hands and release

49
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,880
nothing wrong with thinking per se but as we take refuge together in this moment

53
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,160

trusting that being here with the breath with the body

66
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:23,959
with care is more nourishing and healing than being entangled in thought

67
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,640
sweeter more nourishing right here right here

174
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:23,040
to fit on one screen and you can also

175
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:31,839

176
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:38,079

challenges it's all welcome as i

178
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:50,880
invite your reflections i'll share that um as i was leading the meditation at the

179
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:57,119
beginning especially with inviting us to release to release to release

180
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,720
any tightness tension holding in the body and to allow

181
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,480
the breath to be soothing i realized that my body was quite tight so it was

182
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,079
quite lovely to have this release just really settling settling with the sense

183
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,920
of meta so that's my nugget

184
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,079
there's more but i'd love to hear from you if there's anything you'd like to share

185
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,239

189
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,240
to really settle and be here was wonderful and at first my thought

190
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,359
went to um [Music] well what am i going to do about

191
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:15,119
meditating on my trip hmm should i take my computer and then i

192
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,640
thought no i i'm taking this trip to reconnect with

193
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,160
my sisters that i haven't seen through the pandemic and the most important

194
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:33,520
thing is to show up be there for them and not have my mind thinking of how can

195
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,480
i do everything no just show up

196
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:46,240
oh that touches my heart barbara that is so sweet such a a wisdom answer that came on what do i

197
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:53,440
do oh just show up just just offer your presents beautiful oh i'm loving that

198
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:00,800
voice of wisdom thanks for sharing it with all of us it's lovely yes just show up

199
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:07,920
yeah yeah practice yeah here as as your voice of wisdom has has

200
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:15,280
already brought forth just practice meta with them

201
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,280
with whatever challenges whatever goodness

202
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:28,400
maybe the meta will become compassion if their difficulty maybe will become mudita if there is joy

203
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:35,440
maybe it becomes gratitude or if it becomes equanimity yay i'm happy for your practice in the

204
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,720
next few days barbara it's lovely

205
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,838
it's lovely

206
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:55,599
mary says i really appreciated all of it and may i care for this body with ease

207
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:02,000
yes indeed may i care for this body with these yeah

208
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,240
yeah it's interesting as barbara was talking about having just come from a trip and

209
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:14,560
going on a trip as as many of you might know since i think i might have i mentioned it that i was

210
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:22,960
on a trip myself and i was in new york um and attending a conference and uh

211
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,760
just got back very late last night and my body is creaky and achy and you know that's what happens after you sit on the

212
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,880
airplane for a while so yeah just nice to bring meta to the body especially

213
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,319
when it's not feeling its best may i care for this

214
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:46,079
body with ease as mary has put it beautifully

215
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,760
so dear one since i don't see any other hands reflections we'll have time at the

216
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,480
end for more reflections if any let's turn to hold space

217
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:07,119
for ourselves and each other in small groups and it could be silent

218
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:15,200
holding space if you don't want to talk it's okay if your turn comes you can say pass and just hold silent presents

219
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:21,440
for each other uh for yourself and if you're moved to share anything

220
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,560
about your practice about what's coming up you share one nugget

221
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,839
from your personal experience and then the next person will share

222
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:39,200
something and then the next person then they'll come to you so instead of a long monologue you just share one nugget

223
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:45,839
and so if you have five thoughts to share just share one then the next person and the next person

224
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:52,640
and again from your own experience not asking questions of others managing

225
00:41:52,640 --> 00:42:00,160
their experience not facilitating the group just each person is like a stone soup of meta

226
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:07,440
stone soup of meta bringing your own kindness and care and holding space holding space

227
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,880
especially if you're going to be spending time with relatives and family this can be

228
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:20,720
a great practice session to hold space with people who are freshly meditated so

229
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,960
so with that i'm going to create the rooms

230
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,410
it will take me a moment here we go [Music] um

231
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:40,160
[Music] let's see a little slow today

232
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,400
okay the rooms are created take care of yourselves take care of

233
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,359
each other here we go okay welcome back everyone the rooms are

234
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:59,839
closed so we have a few minutes for any reflections

235
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:08,160
excuse me if there might be anything that has come up especially from from speaking together in groups so

236
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:15,119
please don't be shy you can and if you raise your physical hand i may not see you so please raise

237
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:22,880
your um zoom hand or you can type in chat any questions

238
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:31,440
it's a good time for questions also if there's something was challenging or confusing or didn't

239
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,640
know how to work with it

240
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:44,640
i think i see your hand esther yes there i don't see too many people but i

241
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:50,319
just did happen to see it there okay i was i was looking for my zoom hand i got

242
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:56,560
confused i couldn't find it um yeah i had something challenging come

243
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:03,440
up um there's so much chatter you know about

244
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:10,160
violence and i don't need to describe it

245
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,200
but i noticed i have a lot of fear um

246
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:23,040
just carrying a lot of fear in my body this is not new but it seems like it's really heightened for me right now

247
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,560
so you know it was it was good just to take a beat take a

248
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:36,040
breath and you know try to be in my body

249
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:43,520
yeah yeah yeah so i i hear that in

250
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:49,040
what you shared actually more as a comment than a question what i'm hearing

251
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,640
is that actually given what is going on and also you know what's going in the zeitgeist

252
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:00,960
in this country as well as um also as you shared a pattern that you know fear has been coming up for you

253
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:07,200
before but you realize that today actually taking a beat and just

254
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:13,760
calming calming the body calming the heart with meta

255
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:21,040
trying to remember the exact words used but it was good or something you said it was just something something good

256
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:28,400
about just take just taking a pause taking a pause and resting from that

257
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,640
yeah you know that energy of being vigilant and you know worried

258
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,760
just taking a pause yeah yeah and breathing

259
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,880
beautiful beautiful yeah i hear that more as a as a

260
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,400
reflection like yes this is what's going on and actually this was really nourishing so

261
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,720
um what what i would invite you to consider is that as that agitated energy comes

262
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,160
because that agitated energy of fear is is really uncomfortable because in

263
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:09,440
some ways we cannot control i mean we have some control over our environment but not completely right we know this and

264
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:15,839
yet we can control our hearts we can control our body we can control our minds not to live

265
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:21,040
in fear um because the fear of fear is

266
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,880
is worse than i mean well anyway that can be a much longer

267
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:33,040
dharma talk which i don't want to go into it but but you know this if you have been having a pattern

268
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:39,599
i fear you know that you know the future may or may not turn out what we fear it to be anyway but living with that

269
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:47,200
vigilance and fear is so destructive and in fact the buddha supposedly

270
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,319
gave the instructions to the monks to practice meta

271
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:57,839
originally because of fear because they were living in a state of fear

272
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:03,440
and there's there's a story about it's seven o'clock so i won't repeat it

273
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:11,040
maybe next time but but that is the antidote meta is the antidote to fear esther so

274
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:19,599
perfect thank you thank you thank you so much for your reflection yeah that's beautiful

275
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:26,079
so thank you all thank you so much for your practice for your sincerity for your

276
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:33,680
care for yourselves for each other and may all of us everywhere

277
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:40,720
keep cultivating our hearts with meta care for ourselves for everyone

278
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,580
everywhere may all beings be free may all beings be happy

279
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:49,710
