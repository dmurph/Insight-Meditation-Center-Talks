1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,519
so uh so welcome welcome folks good to

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:15,320
uh good to be with you um looking forward to sitting together practicing

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,439
in one way or another so

4
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,560
um yeah please find your posture

5
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,199
sitting standing L town

6
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:13,240
and if there's anything that feels good about

7
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:22,920
stopping anything that feels good about Stillness just uh anchor there

8
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:40,640
doesn't need to be intense and the pleasantness can coexist

9
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,880
with a lot of unpleasantness but anchor to whatever feels

10
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,360
good in the

11
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
stopping

12
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,879
e e

13
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:11,239
to be uh drawn into concerns is

14
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,599
natural and pleasantness Mild pleasantness doesn't

15
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:26,080
feel urgent at all and so it feels irresponsible not

16
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,120
to worry or

17
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:39,239
plan tie up the loose ends of the day

18
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:54,480
week one facet of equinity is just um capacity to

19
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,720
stay with what feels less urgent

20
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
e

21
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
e

22
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
e

23
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
e

24
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,560
e e

25
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,280
maybe there's something soothing about uh your

26
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:24,400
breathing deliciousness of getting oxygen when you need it

27
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:39,560
the Ripple of relaxation as we uh exhale what's been

28
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,039
used up

29
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:20,840
Sati patana says that we uh establish mindfulness

30
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,560
by placing down greed and

31
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,440
distress with respect to the world

32
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,440
in this sense mindfulness is uh

33
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,160
built on the foundation of U something like

34
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,200
equinity we can't turn in words

35
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:36,199
if we are trying to rearrange the

36
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:53,160
external we can't truly turn inwards if we're turning inwards in order to

37
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,399
rearrange the

38
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
external

39
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
for e

40
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,839
we get more comfortable just offering our heart up to the moment

41
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:19,240
trusting that no matter what happens it'll be

42
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Dharma

43
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

44
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

45
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

46
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

47
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

48
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

49
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

50
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

51
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
e e

52
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:55,120
maybe it feels right to uh open

53
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,839
up the uh aperture of a

54
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:33,039
attention let me see how much the uh attent can relax around all

55
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,960
objects the attention [Music] can build and make

56
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,559
objects or substanti than they

57
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,080
are the object becomes denser

58
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:28,840
weightier in our practice we uh

59
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,559
making what uh was Heavy light

60
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,480
in the world it's a little

61
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:25,320
quieter the awareness a little

62
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
louder

63
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

64
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

65
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

66
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

67
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

68
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

69
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,480
e e

70
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:03,159
maybe even your autobiograph becomes a little

71
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:14,000
light run through with a

72
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:36,799
space equin allows the attention to uh to move without snagging

73
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,200
on

74
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:52,520
objects snagging the way a hangnail gets snagged on fabric

75
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,679
just keep

76
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
opening

77
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

78
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

79
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

80
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
e e

81
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,700
[Music]

82
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,080
e

83
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:13,600
okay I see a comment no I my um that was just hair a cat did not scratch my

84
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,039
farhead a cat has scratched my

85
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:25,080
forehead that's true

86
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:31,840
uh I just don't fully understand the difference between cats and

87
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:41,000
dogs and a dog that you love you just get up get up close Head to Head kind of

88
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:50,399
thing that apparently is not how one expresses feline love and you might get a claw to the

89
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:56,519
forehead as I did

90
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:03,039
um but it was my fault was my fault I should have read the signals

91
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,880
better um it's a little little bit non

92
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,080
seiter on the Dharma theme but this is a

93
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:22,120
slow process of getting to know each other and so all of that is

94
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:30,760
true okay me cord that wasn't recorded at

95
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,519
least the audio thank

96
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:45,880
goodness um okay

97
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:52,000
so um this

98
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,799
world this world is um is complicated

99
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,799
and we we grapple with it as best we

100
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:15,200
can and uh the systems we we live in

101
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,159
environmental economic systems they're just staggeringly

102
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:29,518
complex Economist once said to me like no one understands the economy

103
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:38,200
and our [Music] brain you know this is um one

104
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:45,080
uh researcher wolf singer the more we learn about the brain he says the more

105
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:50,960
abstract will the descriptions become because we shall be dealing with increasingly

106
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,840
complex Assemblies of neurons and the spaciotemporal patterns generated by

107
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:02,279
these assemblies these patterns are with all likelihood

108
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:07,600
non-stationary and best described as Dynamic trajectories of a highly

109
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,480
nonlinear system we'll have to consider more than one bra more more and more

110
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:19,799
that the brain is a member of a sociocultural network and that some of the phenomena

111
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:26,120
that seem to be so difficult to explain in pure neuronal terms will have their

112
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:32,440
explanation only when considering interactions among brains or networks of

113
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:39,600
brains many of the constructs that are so difficult to relate to brain processes like value systems

114
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,840
Consciousness intentionality and so forth have only come into the world

115
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,320
because brains mirror themselves reciprocally in other brains and assign

116
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:57,600
properties to then uh the then gained experiences obviously the complexity of

117
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:04,559
these networks formed by interacting brains by far exceeds the complexity of

118
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,799
individual brains and

119
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:17,799
so even our own life in certain respects is

120
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:25,320
beyond our comprehension we um we desperately try

121
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:36,279
to explain our life you know to explain how we got to be the way we are

122
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:43,600
to explain why we love or do not love another person to explain a mood a

123
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:51,120
momentary why we're feeling like this right now to explain our moral commitments our

124
00:33:51,120 --> 00:34:00,440
beliefs why we value this or that we give a lot of um a lot of

125
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:07,399
reasons for what we do and say and believe but those

126
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:14,878
reasons may not be the actual causes of our actions our words our

127
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:24,560
beliefs we tell stories we tell the story of our life we tell heroic stories

128
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,200
or tragic stories or we tell stories of

129
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:40,240
redemption but every story is ambivalent about

130
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,919
truth and what we call my life is much

131
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:51,040
more mysterious than we tend to

132
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:58,880
believe and then there's this universe you know

133
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:07,160
this is from Co cosmological science um we can currently see a sphere

134
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:15,400
around us extending 46 billion light years in all directions known as the observable

135
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:21,760
universe light and galaxies beyond the sphere haven't yet had time to reach

136
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:28,440
us on our leading cosmological theory the rate at which new Galaxy

137
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,320
become visible will Decline and those currently more than 63 billion light

138
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,760
years away will never become visible from the earth we could call this the

139
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:47,119
region within this distance the eventually observable

140
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:53,400
universe accelerating expansion also puts a limit on what we can ever affect

141
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,800
if today you shine a ray of light out into space it could reach any Galaxy

142
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,560
that's currently less than 16 billion light years away but galaxies further

143
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:10,160
than this are being pulled away so quickly that neither light nor anything

144
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,359
else we might send could ever affect

145
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:26,200
them there's something beyond the eventual even the eventually observable

146
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:34,520
universe you know and I read that because it's like just a Marvel at how much we'll never

147
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:43,839
know it's so complex and it's so

148
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:53,160
simple a yogi walked in to a a one-on-one practice meeting uh with me

149
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:58,319
on a recent Retreat and um

150
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:04,640
said something like um it's so

151
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:11,280
simple there's just love and

152
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:22,119
heartbreak you know sometimes people speak about insights but this Yogi was

153
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:26,680
speaking from the inside

154
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:34,319
and the the budda said um if we if we focus on the wrong categories of

155
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:41,040
experience the wrong distinctions really we spin out we get confused we cause

156
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:48,599
trouble praise and blame good and evil self and other if we get too fixated

157
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:54,440
it's not the right place for our energy and so he offered a much more

158
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,480
fundamental distinction that simplifies is

159
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:05,880
everything suffering and peace the highest

160
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:14,440
happiness and maybe love and heartbreak is kind of variation on that

161
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:21,880
theme and perhaps for for you love and heartbreak is a

162
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:30,160
useful framework for understanding your life simply it of

163
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,960
it there was so you know so much love in

164
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:45,920
the beginning as a baby the soft animal of uh your body loving what it

165
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:53,400
loves and all that love all that need almost

166
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:02,240
instantaneously running into heartbreak the world has and will disappoint us at

167
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:09,920
a fundamental level whatever love we've received it's

168
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:18,640
involved heartbreak whatever love we get it will involve more

169
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:27,480
heartbreak but we try to grow up perhaps Master the kind of dialectic of um of

170
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:36,920
love and heartbreak we grow up and we try to figure out what we love or what's actually

171
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:42,359
worthy of our love and maybe we we find someone to

172
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:48,400
love and someone uh with whom we dramatize the

173
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:58,160
cycles of giving and receiving L Cohen said um said

174
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,280
it doesn't um matter whether we found ourselves in the loneliness of

175
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:12,319
separation or the vertigo of Union everyone finally learns there

176
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:19,079
ain't no cure for love and maybe that's a

177
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:29,318
way of saying that something like we can't not love

178
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,520
we must love but that love entails

179
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,920
heartbreak so there's no

180
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,160
cure but we can learn to love and all

181
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:55,040
let thou the heart to break in a way that's uh imbued with credible

182
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:02,760
Grace to let that become uh consolidate wisdom

183
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:12,280
compassion we um must perceive and stand guard over the love and the Heartbreak

184
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:19,079
of people we care about to actually stand guard to

185
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:23,920
protect their love to honor their

186
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,359
heartbreak if we cannot perceive the love the Heartbreak of

187
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:38,280
others our our care for them our own love for them will feel

188
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,359
misat tuned might even be

189
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,480
alienating and we have uh we have goals and

190
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:57,800
aspirations we try in our lives we try in our work we try in relationship ships

191
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:04,200
we try in our spiritual practice

192
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:10,119
and all that trying all that trying is

193
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:17,720
okay but it better not lose sight of

194
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,880
love and better not forget

195
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:31,440
heartbreak we grow up and um and

196
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,680
discover to our amazement we should have known but to our amazement that

197
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,760
we must uh yield our life back to

198
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:52,559
