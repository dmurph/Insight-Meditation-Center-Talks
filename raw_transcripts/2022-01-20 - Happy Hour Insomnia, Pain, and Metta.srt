1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:08,400
okay so formerly hello and welcome to happier

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,920
lovely to see you to be with you dear fellow practitioners

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,359
yeah so for the theme for today um

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,320
the theme is inspired by a conversation i had um

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,040
with a practitioner was talking about who was um or having a practice discussion and

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,719
about um how they wake up sometimes in the middle of the night

7
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,079
with and they have insomnia and pain and

8
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,399
and this is part of the human condition anyone anyone has ever any one of you who has

9
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,000
never i can't speak tonight the question i'm trying to get out is to

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,280
feel into your own experience and remember the times that you have woken

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,520
up in the middle of the night with insomnia um or with pain

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,520
um anyone not anyone who's not had that experience in

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,159
their lives yeah it's it's we all have that experience of waking up

14
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,200
with pain with insomnia or or if not in the middle of the night

15
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,240
um we have a body we have a human body all

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,840
of us experience pain at some point it's a part of being human

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,479
um it's it's a mark of existence having a body

18
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,960
that experience illness it experiences pain and experiences aging

19
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,320
um etc it's a mark of existence so

20
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,520
so knowing that these are parts of being human it's not a mistake

21
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:12,080
it's not that you have done something wrong and you're being punished or you're bad it's just part of life these

22
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,840
things happen insomnia happens illness happens because we are human

23
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,560
beings things arise causes and conditions so many of them out of our control some within our

24
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,280
control but so many of them out of our control so many of them out of control

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,959
out of our control so so how do we work how can we work

26
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:46,160
compassionately and with meta with these causes and conditions so

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,440
so keep this meditation this teaching your back

28
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,879
pocket the next time you wake up in the middle of the night perhaps with pain or

29
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,239
with uh with insomnia so

30
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,159
so the first invitation the first invitation

31
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,319
is how we approach the perspective we take

32
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,800
with what is arising do we um

33
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:26,480
self-flagellate do we apply what's called second arrows in the buddha's teachings the first

34
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,280
arrow is the pain the first arrow is the suffering this insomnia that has arisen

35
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,239
because of all the cause and conditions do we then take and and

36
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,840
hit ourselves and injure ourselves with second arrows

37
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,959
of oh why me why is this happening to me why

38
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,680
what's wrong with me like i it's my fault i'm terrible like me bad

39
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,200
bad bad ouch ouch you're already hurting and you know we often take daggers and

40
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,480
just like uh uh we start injuring ourselves even more or this is terrible this is awful make

41
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,160
it go away as if by the force of will we can make it go away

42
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,519
and guess what's especially sleeping in pain the more we tighten the more our

43
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,120
bodies and our minds tighten around it with aversion with wanting to push it

44
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,919
away guess what happens the opposite right they get worse they

45
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,280
get more wound up both with the pain and with being awake so

46
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,360
so the invitation is to recognize if there are second arrows

47
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,880
and if there are second arrows again don't don't take on third arrows like oh

48
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,040
i'm a terrible practitioner i i'm self-flagellating i i've been

49
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,080
meditating for a while and i still i'm hard on myself okay please don't take

50
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,240
third and fourth and fifth error just have some humor kindness it's okay

51
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,360
it's okay it's part of the human condition it's okay this happens

52
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,560
this happens and instead instead what if we turned it around what if we

53
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,720
turned it around let's say in the middle of the night when you're awake thinking

54
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:34,639
okay great here is an opportunity for practice i could be sleeping but no actually i can

55
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,000
practice in this moment i can practice i can

56
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,199
calm and settle my mind and heart and deepen because often pain often as

57
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,800
you well know already pain suffering sorrow are the doorways

58
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,039
to awakening they are not problems to get rid of

59
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:05,199
to push away so that now you can practice oh this pain is this physical

60
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,560
pain is bugging me if i could only be comfortable so that i could meditate

61
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,680
like that's such a funny perspective right the pain the suffering this insomnia is

62
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,120
the doorway is the invitation hello dear human being

63
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:31,120
who is suffering this is what suffering is like ah welcome to acknowledging to opening to

64
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,800
the human condition for yourself and all other beings you can be sure

65
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,360
there are other beings in that moment in time in the world who are also

66
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,840
either having insomnia or having pain thousands thousands of us given that we

67
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,240
have they're what seven or almost eight billion of us or something like that now i think the most recent

68
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,360
uh count i heard um there are there would be hundreds if not

69
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,120
thousands of human beings in that moment who are having the same condition as you

70
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,880
are having so i'll say more in the guided meditation but essentially

71
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,680
we want to open up to the pain to the suffering to the insomnia

72
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:27,759
ah hold it with with kindness hold it with kindness

73
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,880
hold it with kindness because sometimes we don't you don't

74
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,759
have a choice it's here it's here it's here

75
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,120
it's already here there's not much you can do about it so you can't push it away so by trying to push it away it

76
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,840
actually makes things worse so opening up opening up and you realize actually when

77
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,240
you stop resisting when you stop resisting that some things

78
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,360
let's go something releases something let's go

79
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,560
and so that's number one and number two is meta meta really a lot of meta

80
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,039
a lot of self-compassion because in fact working with challenges it's you know

81
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:26,080
meditation is not all about bliss and hanging out in blissful states but it turns out that actually working with

82
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:33,120
pain and sorrow and insomnia can lead to bliss states i mean it seems

83
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,120
counterintuitive how can holding being with challenge lead to

84
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,399
bliss lead to ease but that's exactly what happens which is

85
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,080
which can seem so counter-intuitive but that

86
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,279
i invite you to open up open up

87
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:04,720
the way that your mind habitually treats pain like okay make it go away

88
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:12,959
i don't like it terrible i just want pleasure i just want ease open up to the ways that you can grow in

89
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,519
your humanity the ways in which your humanity your wisdom your

90
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,519
compassion can open up can flourish for yourself

91
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,279
for and for others through this pathway

92
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,040
so there is so much to say so much opportunity in this and

93
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,959
i've already spoken plenty and i think i like to switch invite us to switch

94
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:49,519
to um practice and uh maybe what whatever you need to

95
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:56,959
no i'll share in the guided meditation i think that's enough we're adornment so

96
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:05,000
so i invite you to arrive [Music] in your seat

97
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,839
i invite you to arrive in your seat

98
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,519
in this moment arriving [Music]

99
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,519
blending

100
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,920
as always connecting connecting with the breath

101
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,120
arriving arriving in this moment

102
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,720
arriving in this moment

103
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,959
arriving with the breath

104
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,839
with the body whatever is arising in the body

105
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:39,760
letting go of thoughts of plans whatever has come before not needed

106
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,839
taking a moment of refuge

107
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,480
the breath connected connecting subtly

108
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,040
let it go let it go here

109
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,839
just connecting with the breath in the body

110
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,560
gently ever so gently

111
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,839
ever so gently making space

112
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,519
letting the breath be nourishing healing cleansing as it

113
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,079
moves through

114
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:19,720
each breath arriving more fully with each breath

115
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:34,839
imagining that in this moment you're woken up in the middle of the

116
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,480
night with insomnia and maybe some discomfort

117
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:49,360
it's not turning away pushing it away with aversion hating it

118
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:57,360
can you turn towards open your heart turn towards let your body relax

119
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,480
open up embrace

120
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,160
this moment of being awake being aware

121
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,839
feeling the body and being breathed fully embracing it fully embracing it

122
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,918
it is like this right now

123
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,320
can i open my heart as if i'm opening my arms wide wide

124
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,880
the way you would open your arms wide to embrace the sunset

125
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,840
very beautiful sky or the clouds or the ocean

126
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,799
this moment is like this

127
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,320
this moment of being alive being awake is like this

128
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,960
what gifts what wisdom what gifts of wisdom and

129
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,200
compassion does this moment have for me

130
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,840
shifting turning our attitude

131
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:52,200
to open up to this first and foremost

132
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,840
lending awareness running awareness ever so gently

133
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,200
be aware of the body breathing on the body

134
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,960
nooks and crannies maybe there's some discomfort

135
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:40,400
as if you're holding holy little child [Music]

136
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,400
a baby that was hurting her in your mind's eye holding all the parts

137
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,799
of the body that might not be comfortable

138
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,320
not pushing them away but letting awareness

139
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:05,000
hold them gently lovingly

140
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:31,399
can there be patience can there be gentleness

141
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:44,280
as the mind connects with the body

142
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,360
the discomfort in the body as if cooing is as soothing as a singing

143
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,520
a lullaby

144
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,559
to any part of the body that's not comfortable

145
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,200
that's in pain

146
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,000
gentle gentle gentle care

147
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:35,320
as if you're rocking this little baby that is your body

148
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,400
goodwill love care for this body

149
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,720
that is mine and also not mine completely

150
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,600
it's nature

151
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,559
this body doing the best it can

152
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,240
with all the causes and conditions of this life

153
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:42,880
thank you buddy i care for you i hold you with ease

154
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,559
with care tenderness

155
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:17,320
and now if you wish imagining inviting yourself

156
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:24,960
to consider that you are not alone

157
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:32,240
that you are not alone and whatever is arising

158
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:39,200
in this moment whether it's insomnia

159
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,840
or physical pain challenge

160
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:57,720
considering that there are so many human beings beings around the world

161
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:06,000

something i'm paraphrasing um a friend once gave me

226
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:09,359
a box of darkness as a gift or a friend once gave me a bar a

227
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:16,640
right a friend once gave me a box of darkness it took me a while to realize that too

228
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:24,000
was a gift so may we realize that the gifts of darkness boxes of darkness or

234
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,760
is going to be a little praise uh when you said i get to suffer

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:06,000
i get to suffer and you were sincerely pleased with that and what a

236
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,599
benefit and a gift that is to uh the practice and

237

i've been struggling with tinnitus and that helped immensely and the other day

238
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,079
i said to my acupuncturist that i'm going to try to treat it

239
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:28,560
in principle as the hiss of mindfulness it's not much of a bill

240
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,960
so and uh she liked that and i i'm been working on that and it has

241
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:41,040
helped a lot and i just want you to know that uh it's it's not as bad as it was it's not

242
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,800

243
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,240
but that you know the future is not here and the practice is really helping me out so

274
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:11,760
reflections comments um if any insights arose for you especially

275
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,440
jerry i see your hand shut up please okay

276
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:23,119
uh yes uh thanks nikki uh we were uh

277
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:28,720
uh talking in the in the group about the uh

278
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,119
the sangha as well as the small groups as i've mentioned before being the secret sauce of this

279
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:41,359
additional secret sauce of the sangha but that also um

280
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:47,040
not just the physical pain as was mentioned to diet about tinnitus but

281
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:53,920
also psychic pain and the overlap and that both of them

282
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,519
even if they're separate or reconnected they seem to be

283
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,800
it's not that they disappear perhaps but there's a the experience of

284
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,839
the warmth of the sangha and the small groups actually takes the edge off of

285
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:15,839
this and it's one person called it it's like an

286
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:22,400
adhesive you want to keep coming back for it and i would say well maybe addiction is too strong a word but i get

287
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:29,040
withdrawal when i don't get here it's it's the best it's the wholesome

288
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:36,240
addiction it's the whole some um yeah dharma desire yeah it's it's it's

289
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,839
wholesome it's beautiful it's something that's wholesome and it's wonderful and and thank you for sharing that jerry

290
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:47,040
that the power of sangha really the power of connection with

291
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,280
with understanding with fellow humans who are on this path is so powerful

292
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:59,119
so powerful um yeah and thank you for highlighting that

293
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:06,720
especially when we're going through physical emotional psychospiritual challenges just

294
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:12,640
we can't we can't do it alone it's hard so hard to do it alone

295
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:21,359
so yeah greg i see your hand this needs to be quick because it's our seven so go ahead

296
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,960
yeah um it's a mark of of the quality of the

297
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:35,680
people in this saying i've unfortunately lost two of my best friends in the past week

298
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:42,240
one of them yesterday and to have the confidence to share that with the two

299
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,280
people who were in my breakout and have them offer

300
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:53,920
a meta to me in a very meaningful and sort of beautiful way

301
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,920
said something about the group and about the sangha and um

302
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:08,480
it gives me hope for what is best about about humanity so thank you and and thank you

303
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:15,280
collectively for that thank you greg thank you so much for

304
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:22,720

305
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,760
to two of your close friends this in one week is it's hard

306
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:34,319
thank you for feeling comfortable and safe enough to bring it to the group to go to the

307
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:40,079
small into the big group and being open to be held with mental and compassion

308

and thank you for what you said yeah thank you

309
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:52,160
yeah so yeah so i went to i've gone over time i

310
00:48:52,160 --> 00:49:00,240
wanted to say that i'll see you on friday but on monday and next wednesday and for the

311
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:06,559
future for wednesdays there will be someone who will be substituting because as many of you know i'll be teaching a

312
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:13,119
course called befriending mortality which actually many of you i think have already signed up for so i'll see you in

313
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:19,440
that course and one last uh reflection

314
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:25,040
says in my group there was mention of the brahmavirus and i recall how they are also useful for meeting suffering

315
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:30,800
within ourselves and in others i'm also reminded of the talk i heard before about discerning between the parameters

316
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,960
