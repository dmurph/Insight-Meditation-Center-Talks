showing up with you um and if you wish you're welcome to

32
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:26,000
put yourselves each other on gallery view so you can see each other i can't do that because i'm

33
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,360
for security and privacy reasons as i

34
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:38,720
said i i uh spotlight myself my image so that only my image shows on

35
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,959
youtube not yours not your names but anyway just to get a sense of appreciation as

36
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,160
you look at each other as you look at this anger we just have a sense of the sangha

37
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:57,040
um supporting each other supporting each other we wouldn't

38
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,200
um happy hour may not be happening if it wasn't for for you showing up for you showing ups

39
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,880
or appreciating yourself appreciating each other knowing that

40
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,000
you are providing support for others

41
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,600

43
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,839
but simply by showing up so

44
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,079
so we'll use this as the basis this reflection for the base as the

45
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,680
basis of our practice today

46
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,480

hi you know i could feel why that was important i could feel the

175
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:34,240
the uh you know the emotional energy i could feel a lot kind of churning there

176
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:41,599
and thinking about about friends but i don't really understand it could you explain more why this is so

177
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:47,040
important um why is

178
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:55,760
spiritual friendship is important ah yeah yeah um

179
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:02,960
well it's it's really um i would say

180
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,960
it's something it's actually i can answer that let me let me ask you

181
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:15,839
something and then i'll answer um when you were saying that you felt emotionally emotionally churning

182
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:22,880
um you felt it emotionally would you say a little more about that please fred

183
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:29,760
i could very readily feel the connection and the good feeling for uh for the person and then

184
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,920
the people that i began to to picture i could feel the the connection between

185
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:42,800
us um and i suppose you know i i might feel

186
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,880
the same thing with friends of you know long duration and

187
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:55,920
deep experience i see that i'm beginning to answer my question here that uh there's it seems that there's a

188
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:02,078
kind of um leap over years and leap over

189
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:11,040
time spent together in the context of spiritual friendship so that suddenly while we

190
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:18,160
i might think of a spiritual friend who i haven't spent anywhere near as much time with or not even physical proximity with older

191
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:23,680
friends still there's a lot of a lot of good feeling and emotional

192
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:30,480
energy there beautiful did i answer my question i think you did you you answered it any

193
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:36,880
better than what i was gonna say i'm just gonna let that go fred and honor what you said it's beautiful thank you

194
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:51,838

oh good thank you um i found this to be like the most

196
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:06,559
important kind of practice i've done in a while um i felt myself in a sense connected

197
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:14,240
with the many people over the years of practice and there was this kind of responsibility or

198
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:20,319
kind of as you use the word last week nobility that i felt and being engaged with them

199
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:28,400
and and it helped me dive more deeply into my um into my

200
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:34,880
practice of being sensing and hearing since hearing being present in a sense for them as

201
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:41,119
well as with them this is great very good nikki thank you

203
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,880
and and this nobility it's it's it's beautiful and as i was leading

204
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,319
it too there's a sense of oh yes my practice my i connect with it more it's

205
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:07,760
it's it serves others it's not just about me it's serving others there's that beauty of nobility

210
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:44,960

211
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:51,200
contracted and i held it with tenderness because somebody had talked about holding

212
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:58,880
it with tenderness and my higher self told me what to do i said you need to do

222
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:02,400
i felt less alone and more tender for the past hour not that i typically feel lonely this is

226
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:28,000
especially given that tonight's practice is about spiritual friendship let us

227
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:35,520
turn in small groups in small groups of size three or four to practice for a few

228
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:41,680
minutes with each other just holding each other with tenderness just as kenneth was talking

229
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:48,960
you know holding our hearts tenderly holding ourselves tenderly holding each other tenderly these beautiful beings

230
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:54,079
who just like us suffer we all have suffering every single one of us

231
00:55:54,079 --> 00:56:01,920
we have challenges and all of us every single one of us has gifts and beauty and insights so let's turn to practice

232
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:09,599
for six seven minutes in small groups listening to each other hearing each

233
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:17,520
other ourselves and as always we start with 15 seconds of silent

234
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:24,240
meta for ourselves and each other and then um share as little or as much as you

235

okay welcome back everyone the rooms are closed and we have a few

238
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:49,440
minutes for reflections what might have come up from the group conversations from spiritual

239
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:59,520
friendship conversations don't be shy

240
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:04,960
you can raise your hand if you wish or type in chat

241
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:13,520
bill please hello um well i i think i stumbled over

242
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:20,480
something here when you were talking i seem to do that a lot um but you talked about mentioned about

243
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:26,240
you know the spiritual friends being all the path and i'm i started obsessed with the fact that

244
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:32,400
the vast majority of my friends have nothing to do with the dharma at all and i just i just kind of went down

245
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:38,559
the wrong lane i think and i started obsessed about that and it i i'm not quite sure what to make of the

246
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:44,400
statement in that context that spiritual friends are all the path does that mean a big part of my path is

247
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:50,400
i'm a lot of my time i'm just not on the path or i don't know where i'm going with this so

248
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:58,240
there you go yeah yeah yeah yeah no problem yeah so

249
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:06,880
so um maybe one one way to think about this

250
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:12,079
um is that you know and and maybe i'll come back to what i

251
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:17,920
was saying earlier uh when when fred asked the question and and then beautifully answered his

252
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:25,280
question so i didn't say anything but you know in general you know even if we take the buddhist context completely aside

253
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:31,599
and practice and mindfulness and cultivation if we just forget about all this for a moment and just think about psychology and

254
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:36,720
social psychology and and just what we know about anthropology and social psychology

255
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:41,760
well the friends you spend time with people that you spend time with they

256
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:49,520
impact you and you impact them i mean duh of course right that's we know this as human beings

257
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:57,359
that's why parents you care so much about what kind of people their kids spend time with and and you

258
01:05:57,359 --> 01:06:04,480
know there's plenty of research too and all that but um so so that's what i would say and

259
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:11,440
and maybe uh instead of going down the rabbit hole bill what i would consider is that

260
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:18,720
you know the friends that you spend time with do they inspire you do they support you and and

261
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:24,559
wanting to cultivate you know they may not know anything about mindfulness it doesn't matter but do they inspire you

262
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:31,359
to be the best person you want to be good that's all thank you yeah you're

263
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:37,440
welcome so yeah you don't have to be strict about it so much but yeah spiritual friendship could could be more

264
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:43,520
general more be more people who inspired and bring the best out of you yeah

265
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:49,440
thank you thank you for that yeah yeah and jerry says discovered mudita
