1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,960
so welcome welcome back we'll continue today the third day

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:16,198
of this exploration of the five precepts commitments that allow us

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,160
to uh find greater freedom in our daily activities focusing on five Realms or

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,039
Arenas in which we can avoid unskillful action avoid harm cultivate skillful

5
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:33,640
responses and today we'll focus on the third

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,920
precept the uh abstaining as a way to support practice from unskillful

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,360
expression of Sexual Energy it's the way I'm going to capture it for the moment before we meditate and we'll talk a

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,879
little bit after the sit uh about ways to ways to hold ways

9
00:00:52,879 --> 00:01:00,079
to think about the the uh idea and definition of the third precept

10
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,159
so let's settle in for a set and because I think it's a useful support for

11
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:13,600
exploring the third precept the guided meditation

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:21,798
will at least it's the intention that the guided meditation will will focus on

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,759
balance that at least is the intention going in we'll see how that how that

14
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:36,880
comes up so taking our meditation posture settling the body

15
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:46,078
into posture that's comfortable and at ease but also

16
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:56,000
alert easeful energetic posture for meeting our

17
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,039
experience posture that balances alertness

18
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:09,200
energy attentiveness attuned Attunement

19
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,239
with an attitude of being open to what comes

20
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,319
up we can bring the eyes down if that's comfortable closing them all the way if

21
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,800
that's supportive and if and as we bring the eyes down or

22
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,160
close them we can lean into the rebalancing that

23
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,840
happens naturally with that movement moving away from

24
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,840
the visual realm

25
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,519
to the inner life the inner world

26
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,599
we can feel a similar rebalancing if we bring the attention in and down inward

27
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,959
into the body downward

28
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,159
from the Mind into the

29
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,440
body and here too can lean into that

30
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,920
rebalancing even if it's early morning for us

31
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:39,120
walking around with our eyes open we may find ourselves already just a little out of balance it's useful to

32
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,080
notice the rebalancing that the meditation can

33
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:00,040
provide we can bring our attention to something in our experience in the meditation the breathing

34
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:09,239
that has within it for the vast majority of us in most cases has within it a Natural

35
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:19,280
Balance when we connect our attention with the breathing we're connecting with

36
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:28,919
a phenomenon in our experience and our bodily functions that's naturally balanced

37
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,360
can settle in with confidence connecting with the breath

38
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,080
and feeling the way that the breath knows what

39
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,120
the appropriate the wise the skillful amount of oxygen needed

40
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:55,440
is and just how much waste gas to expel with each out

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,639
breath and today as we engage in this exercise this practice

42
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,000
of bringing our attention repeatedly back to Here and Now connecting over and

43
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,759
over again with the breath we can be aware of this rebalancing that happens without any

44
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,560
effort we nudge or gently pull attention back to the breathing when we find the

45
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,720
Mind caught up in thinking we can do it without hurry without

46
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,280
judgment and we can notice the rebalancing the world of

47
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,800
thought so attractive with all its Pleasures with all its Delights and with

48
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,560
all its with all its anxious

49
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:00,280
meanderings we can notice is sometimes a place of unbalance

50
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:07,280
we find ourselves a little off balance as we return to the breath as we

51
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,599
open back up to the breath bringing the breath back to the

52
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:20,520
center of our attention we can notice the sense of

53
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,440
coming back into

54
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:35,280
balance just a balance that can have both thought and ease in

55
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:43,240
it it's a place where we can rest the Mind by connecting it with the natural

56
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,080
breathing balance

57
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:15,440
each breath offers an opportunity for balance and

58
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:23,199
rebalance just this breath no need to be concerned about the

59
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,800
previous

60
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:36,720
breath the breath itself is unconcerned with the next breath doesn't need to plan doesn't need to

61
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:55,919
fret whichever breath we find ourselves with when we return to the breathing bring the breathing back to the center

62
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:05,960
of attention this is the right breath this is the breath where balance is available

63
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,080
and it's okay to wobble it's okay to get off

64
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:48,279
balance much like riding a bike pushing a scooter or even

65
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:58,839
walking we rebalance connect with the momentum of the breathing

66
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,519
and like those activities maybe the rebalancing can also be

67
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,760
pleasant of the enjoyment that's available in the

68
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:27,200
meditation this lovely feeling of rebalancing again and again

69
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:37,519
this is an enjoyment this is a pleasant this is a pleasure

70
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:45,000
even that the Buddha has encouraged us to cultivate not to

71
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,120
fear but to lean into this natural balancing available in

72
00:09:53,120 --> 00:10:00,320
the meditation is a safe place to enjoy ourselves

73
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
enjoy

74
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240

e e

107
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,480
so as we bring this meditative

108
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:05,640
meditation period to a close we

109
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,519
can return to this exhortation to enjoy this enjoyment this pleasure that

110
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:21,279
comes with the meditation doesn't need to be

111
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:28,399
feared it doesn't depend on external conditions it's free

112
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:36,278
and it allows us to develop a wholesome relationship with

113
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:44,080
enjoyment we can let it come and go and because sometimes our enjoyment

114
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,799
of things is sticky we get

115
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:57,039
entangled we can in dedicating Merit today make a practice of letting it go

116
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:03,399
by wishing it to others may all beings know some of this

117
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:10,000
pleasure may all beings know some of this enjoyment this free

118
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:18,159
contentment may all beings no ease may all beings be free

119
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,360
from suffering

120
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,158
so welcome

121
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,480
again greetings

122
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:06,398
so we'll explore today as we have been in brief

123
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:12,679
fashion with a focus on actions instead of actors with a focus on mental

124
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:19,720
action another of the precepts today the third precept which is a commitment to abstain

125
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:26,039
from unskillful expression of sexual energy or unskillful

126
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:31,640
entanglement with the enjoyment of sexual

127
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:40,080
expression the wording we use to capture the third precept can be really important in guiding us

128
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:50,320
and I like this idea that just came up in the meditation that the uh that the enjoyment that we

129
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,159
experience can be experienced in a a free way in the

130
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:03,960
meditation and that it can the meditation has a place in helping us understand how to how to

131
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,200
respond skillfully or in a in a with a wholesome mind state to the enjoyment

132
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,880
that is a natural part of

133
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,919
living sometimes householders lay practitioners like most of us here think

134
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:26,679
that monastics have it easy and in regards to the third precept um

135
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:32,000
monastics at least uh uh have a clear

136
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,600
rule to abstain entirely from sexual relations for the lay practitioner it's

137
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:44,880
quite a bit more um complex again it's not a commandment it's not a rule that

138
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:54,559
we abstain from sexual interactions uh and yet it's a it's a it

139
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:02,840
can be a commitment to be attentive to the way that we react to respond to the

140
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:10,440
enjoyment and pleasure that come up in our in our sexual behaviors our sexual

141
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:20,240
expressions the uh we can expand the definition in I think some useful

142
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,159
ways from the focus on sexual

143
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:33,320
which in many cases implies social that is interactions with other people to

144
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:40,120
include uh aspects of expression of sexual energy that is private or

145
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:47,919
erotic in nature rather than social or interactive and in some cases the

146
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:54,559
precept is expanded to include our interactions with all sensual Pleasures

147
00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:01,559
not just sexual pleasures among sensual pleasures and uh this is the in in a way the

148
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:07,919
literal meaning of the phrase that's used in poly to to express this

149
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:14,760
commitment to abstain from certain behaviors and it might be a little too

150
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,960
broad but as we'll see in the daily suggestion for a daily practice today

151
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:26,240
that sensual pleasures of lesser sorts or less heady sorts or less complicated

152
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:32,840
sorts whether that be you know chocolate or

153
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:39,000
uh another pleasure you encounter today um Can again give us a a small thing a

154
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,000
little thing to practice H with how we how we respond to pleasure signals in

155
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,559
the brain how we respond to enjoyment uh things so in the case of this

156
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,840
precept it can be useful to invoke the other four precepts two of which we've

157
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:05,440
already discussed and two more of which are to come so we can ask ourselves for example

158
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:13,440
with the first precept does this uh sexual activity in which I plan to engage am engaged or have just

159
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,320
engaged is it does it cause harm physical harm to myself or

160
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,358
others we could also say does it cause cause harm to a

161
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:29,720
relationship to harm to myself harm to others harm to

162
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:34,878
both in regards to the second precept which we discussed yesterday does this

163
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:40,079
sexual activity involve taking something that's not freely

164
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:46,878
given I suggested yesterday that a valuable practice is to watch the way we use the

165
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:54,520
internet and this is a this is a place where there can be entanglement for some of us around things not freely given

166
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:00,320
that find their way into our expression or our enjoyment of Sexual

167
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:06,320
Energy in regards to the fourth precept um which we'll get to

168
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,599
tomorrow which involves avoiding unskillful speech we might ask whether

169
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:20,440
this sexual activity this sexual interaction this uh expression of sexual energy is

170
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:28,800
deceitful does it involve for example uh keeping making something Secret

171
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,880
instead of just making something appropriately private and again it's a way of asking ourselves learning more

172
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:43,880
about how we're how we're responding to uh an action of of sexual expression

173
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:50,200
or enjoyment and the fifth precept the one that asks us to abstain from what I've

174
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:56,720
called intoxicated heedlessness we can ask and sometimes it's useful to ask whether our

175
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,440
entanglement with the pleasure or enjoyment or expression of sexual energy

176
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:08,440
is uh is compulsive or uh

177
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:14,119
is um avoidant or leads to

178
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:22,440
heedlessness again a way of querying quering our action so aside from the kinds of harms

179
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:28,800
kinds of harm that might be um referenced in each of these

180
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,760
uh ways of applying the other four precepts it's it's useful to just bring

181
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:43,640
to awareness that it's not pleasure or enjoyment of sex or of erotic activities

182
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:51,680
that's that's problematic it's rather our relationship with that enjoyment or that pleasure how

183
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,880
we respond to it how we get entangled in it or whether we can remain free of

184
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,319
entanglement with it the the pleasure we experience this

185
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:10,839
is true for all beings I think I can say that pretty broadly that um pleasure provides one of

186
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:17,960
the most important signals to the brain to the being and it has a very

187
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:26,000
um very forceful influence in in our lives and so learning to work with it

188
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,520
seeing it not as a problem but as something where we can problematically respond to

189
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,720
it helps us forward and this practice this practice of mindful attention to

190
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:43,680
what's Happening Here and Now that the Buddhist Traditions give us uh can be a

191
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,640
very valuable way of helping us meet this Universal

192
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:56,920
experience so we can't expect to make problematic pleasure go away that's not

193
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:02,760
how it seem in the Buddhist uh view but rather we can we can definitely develop

194
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:08,599
skillful ways to meet what is very likely to come up in in our

195
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:15,800
experience so we can notice the stickiness of pleasure stickiness of sexual

196
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,000
enjoyment and useful to notice that it's not inherently sticky it's the mind that

197
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,440
gets stuck to it it gets snagged gets entangled gets caught

198
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:32,680
up the sticking to it or the entanglement the knottedness in

199
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:38,359
it and also the selfing around it right some of the shame or guilt or all the

200
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:46,000
sorts of things that the Mind adds unhelpfully to our experience and alternately the sense of power or

201
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,000
arrogance or superiority that can come with uh responses to

202
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,040
pleasure and we can bring these kinds of ways of responding into our practice

203
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:06,520
they're not separate from our practice they don't have to exist in some different world that we can make them part nothing as Gil as Andrea fella the

204
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:12,599
co- guu teacher of IMC say you know there's nothing that uh is outside the

205
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:18,078
realm of mindfulness there's nothing we can't bring this practice

206
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:24,280
to so we can let our growing understanding that develops with the practice of our minds of our

207
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:31,200
hearts when they feel closed when they feel open we can let those U that

208
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,720
growing sensitivity or Attunement let us help us understand what forms of sexual

209
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,800
interaction enjoyment might best be refrained from

210
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:49,319
and those which we can enjoy without uh without entanglement or without harm to

211
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:55,319
ourselves or others we can start to look to it the

212
00:39:55,319 --> 00:40:01,119
attitudes we have toward these activities and again our practice can help

213
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,760
us notice how physical desire how pleasure in the Physical Realm the

214
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,160
sexual realm um which which activities actively

215
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:20,200
support practice which attitudes toward these things are a support for our practice these are precepts that in

216
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:28,720
encouraging us to obstain from harmful activity support our practice and this is true here too that we can actively

217
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,760
contribute to creating stronger relationship stronger connection with

218
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:40,200
others we're with ourselves with our own natural um our own natural patterns of

219
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,839
arousal and expression of

220
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,319
pleasure this is a nice thing to keep in mind just kind of tumbled over this

221
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:58,400
right now but this is a good reminder that these precepts are to support our

222
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:05,040
practice so we bring our practice we bring these these aspects of life into

223
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:11,400
our practice instead of keeping them apart so what might this mean for what

224
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:18,560
to do what kind of things we could engage in today and I think a couple questions like we've sort of proposed in

225
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,599
previous days might be useful in this realm this Arena this kind of heady

226
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:30,599
space of the enjoyment of physical activity that's sexual or

227
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:39,280
erotic I think a good one might be something like um how fully present can I be in this

228
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,960
experience how mindful can I be here David said gills said Andrea fella this

229
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,640
is I hear it in Andrea's voice says there's no place mindfulness can't go right there's no place outside it it's

230
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:58,240
never it's never too small so what would it mean to ask uh or what value might it

231
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,200
have to ask how mindful can I be of what's happening in this in this

232
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:09,440
expression of this Natural Energy in this enjoyment can I be fully present

233
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:17,520
that's a good signal if I can be fully present there's some wholesome response to uh what's

234
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,920
happening another similar one is can this pleasure can this enjoyment and I

235
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:28,960
like by the way I noticed it in the meditation that enjoyment for me the

236
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:35,359
word enjoyment I should be clear lands in a different way than pleasure a lot of associations with the word

237
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:40,680
pleasure when I think about it as sexual enjoyment or enjoyment of you know

238
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:45,760
natural sexual sexual um interests activities Expressions that come along

239
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:53,119
with having being born in a human body being born in any body um enjoyment somehow helps me

240
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:58,160
lighten up a little bit around it I don't know if that's true for anybody else but here's an encouragement to find

241
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:07,960
a word that helps support your practice so can this enjoyment be skillfully held

242
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,880
can I enjoy it and not add a lot to it you know can I enjoy it in a way that's

243
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:21,240
not causing harm and then um maybe let it be less sticky maybe when it causes

244
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:28,000
no harm it's less sticky so

245
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,839
like uh I think the first day when we talked about ants here too it might be

246
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:38,880
useful to start with something uh very small and here there might be some

247
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,960
utility in a broad definition of the third precept that focuses on sensual

248
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:51,000
pleasure pleasure of the senses rather than restricting it to sexual pleasure a good way to begin with

249
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,800
our uh relationship with the pleasures of the senses would be something that

250
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:04,319
is perhaps not as heady as a sexual sexual activity

251
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:10,359
but maybe maybe comes a little bit close I mentioned chocolate at the outset I guess for me that's that's something

252
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:16,839
that can bring a lot of delight a lot of enjoyment and also can be kind of sticky I don't mean literally on a warm day

253
00:44:16,839 --> 00:44:24,520
like apparently it's supposed to be in California today looking at the chat but rather um I can get I can start to get

254
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:30,280
wrapped up in wanting more chocolate wanting better chocolate cholate wanting my friend Kirsten's

255
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:36,520
chocolate um so choosing something small that for you has enjoyment and has

256
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:43,079
Delight in it and then watching how present can you be right can the

257
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,720
pleasantness can the pleasure can the enjoyment whatever word works for you to support your practice can it be

258
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:54,960
skillfully held and perhaps can it be let go of you know could it be shared

259
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:02,640
with others in a way that helps um skillfully hold a

260
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:09,400
pleasure so that's where we'll leave it for today really appreciate everybody checking in I'm distracted a little bit

261
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:16,800
like by looking down and to the side at the at the chats as they come in and it's really lovely to see uh See people

262
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,160
exchanging well wishes and checking in may you be well till

263
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,400
tomorrow and uh maybe find some some wholesome some skillful light and

264
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:36,400
enjoyment in the day um we'll see you tomorrow morning take care till then bye
