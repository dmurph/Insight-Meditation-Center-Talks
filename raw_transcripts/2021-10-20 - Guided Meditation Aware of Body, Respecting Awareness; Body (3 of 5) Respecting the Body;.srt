1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,600
so good day everyone and

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,080
it's nice to see all these names on the chat and some of you i haven't met but i've met your name and your greetings

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,439
many times and uh thank you for it

4
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,960
and also thank you for all those those of you who are

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,559
going to be listening to this later i think that our community our meditation community

6
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,000
extends way beyond the people who actually show up here live

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,760
and and i appreciate so much that there's this wide circles of uh community that

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:59,440
gather around this practice together so the topic for today is respect

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,360
in relationship to the basic mindfulness practice we do

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,560
and also this week the focus is on the body

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:18,240
and so certainly it's valuable to respect the body and uh i'll talk more about that uh

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,640
during the little talk after this but for now i want to i emphasize that

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:32,240
as we attend to the body as we bring mindfulness to the body that it's also important to respect the

14
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,079
awareness that we're using the attention the mindfulness

15
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,520
with which uh we uh perceive this body

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,840
that we're aware of this body that we recognize the different aspects of the body that we focus on

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,640
and so i want to guide you through a little exercise that i've done many times before so some of

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,799
you have done it and even though it's more or less the same exercise it's not any different i don't think of

19
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,679
it as any different than you know just sitting down to meditate to focus on the breathing and we've done

20
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,760
it before but we do it again and again for for some of us for decades

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,959
and uh and so this is a exercise in respecting awareness or to say it

22
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,480
differently in seeing if we can find an awareness

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:37,200
that the attention a way of being attentive that's calm and that it's free of certainly hurry

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,280
but free of extra baggage so the awareness is very simple

25
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,560
and in such a way that we could think of it as being

26
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,560
um

27
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,959
there's a we think of it as being

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,440
awareness is very simple not uh avoidant or held back or

29
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,440
and not coming along with uh forcefulness or expectations

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,480
without uh aversion without resistance without

31
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,000
um just very very simple and so the exercise is to guide you

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,080
through this kind of simplicity that we might be able to do and then to

33
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,760
and then that can be used for attending to the body as different

34
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,400
body sensations come along in the meditation practice

35
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,599
so um

36
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,480
so assuming a meditation posture

37
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,959
and gently closing the eyes

38
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,799
and

39
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,079
and then gently taking a few long slow deep breaths in

40
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,720
and then with maybe a little longer exhale than usual let there be a wave of relaxation

41
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,840
through your body and that wave maybe from the top of the

42
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,440
head as you exhale progressively kind of like moves down through the body just

43
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,960
relaxing softening all the way down to your seat

44
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,240
down your legs even and then do it again

45
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,280
and then letting your breathing return to normal

46
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,520
and maybe for next three or four

47
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,240
breaths on the exhale continue with maybe a wave like relaxation moving

48
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,120
through your body from the head all the way down to the feet

49
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,680
and then to

50
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,960
begin this exercise

51
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:32,680
bring your attention to one of your hands maybe the right hand

52
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,039
and if your hand is complicated maybe it's hurt or in pain or arthritis or something

53
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:49,560
maybe you can find something else that's more neutral maybe one of your feet or

54
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:58,960
maybe an elbow something that's you know doesn't have any particular complications with it

55
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,520
pain or discomfort

56
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:17,720
and then feel the sensations of this place feel the sensations of your of your hand

57
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,479
feeling the palm of the hand

58
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,840
the back of the hand

59
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,199
the fingers

60
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,720
and feel the simplicity of the sensations there

61
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,120
simplicity meaning without needing think about it or remember what it's

62
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,879
been in the past or associations and meanings you attribute

63
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,759
to it just in the moment now

64
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,840
maybe there are sensations of touch if your hand is touching something

65
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,360
maybe there's warmth or coolness

66
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,240
maybe there is tingling and vibration

67
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,440
sensations of pressure

68
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,000
of weight heavy and light

69
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,760
some sensations might be hard and soft

70
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:13,440
and letting the awareness recognize or know how the hand experiences itself

71
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:25,040
in a sense the hand doesn't have a name for itself is at the hand

72
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,279
it's just the sensations that it feels

73
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:52,480
and then notice how you are being aware

74
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,000
are you perplexed

75
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,639
are you eager

76
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,120
are you trying to do this like a school assignment

77
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,160
trying to do it right

78
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,000
or are you disinterested or even resisting

79
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,240
all these ways of being have an influence on

80
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,160
how we are aware how we are mindful

81
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,720
is your awareness pulled back and you're kind of watching or thinking

82
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,959
about the hand from the control tower in the head

83
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,600
are you intimate and close and touch almost like

84
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,399
you're in your hand

85
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,720
and can you adjust your awareness so that it's

86
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:34,160
very simple but clearly connected

87
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:43,839
to the sensations of the hand maybe letting go of thoughts and ideas

88
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,680
like you would if you quieted your mind maybe closed your eyes

89
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,320
to listen to a faint sound far away

90
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,320
and then calmly deliberately

91
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:29,760
slowly maybe move your awareness to the other hand

92
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,240
and adjust your awareness your attention your mindfulness

93
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,639
so it has as little extra baggage

94
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:53,720
extra attitudes expectations or aversions desires

95
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,680
so it's just feeling the hand

96
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,120
feeling how the hand experiences itself

97
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:34,639
respecting your awareness so your awareness can just be a simple

98
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:42,240
and clear as it is when it's alone when it's not

99
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,839
influenced by attitudes desires aversions

100
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,959
when awareness is also not under the influence

101
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,959
of ideas of self

102
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,920
ideas that i have to do it right or i'm doing it wrong

103
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,360
i don't understand right i'm doing it

104
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,839
great just simple awareness of the hand

105
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,399
so awareness respecting awareness is allowing awareness to do its work

106
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,279
without a lot of extra

107
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,600
and then calmly and deliberately

108
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,880
bring your attention to some sensation in your body

109
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,360
that's uncomfortable or unpleasant

110
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:15,279
maybe not dramatically so but calmly bring attention to it

111
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,760
and see if you can be aware of that area of your body in the same way you're aware of your

112
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,760
hand

113
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,480
in trying to respect the simplicity of awareness

114
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,880
without it coming under the influence of your ideas about the discomfort

115
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,879
your aversion or your

116
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,079
desires and instead letting your mindfulness

117
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,680
feel know how that part of your body experiences

118
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,120
itself as if it's allowed to be just the way it

119
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,160
is even discomfort is allowed permission to

120
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:23,240
be there in this simple awareness

121
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,600
if there is impatience or worry

122
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,320
or aversion maybe on the next exhale you can relax

123
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:59,160
that even for just for a few moments

124
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:23,120
relaxing reactivity and for a few moments just feeling

125
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,240
the area where the discomfort is to feel the particularity of the

126
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,480
sensations there the pulsing vibration

127
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,600
pulling pressure tightness

128
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,759
and then i'll ask you to move your attention one attention one more time

129
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:13,039
and this time con connect to your awareness your

130
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:19,280
attention to see if again you can move it calmly

131
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,919
deliberately simply so this simple awareness now

132
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,360
moves to experience that part of your body

133
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,799
where you accompany your breathing

134
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,200
feeling the area of area of your body where breathing is where you feel your breathing your body

135
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,200
breathing

136
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,960
and allow yourself to be aware simply of the sensations that come into play as

137
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,120
you breathe

138
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,360
maybe every breath is like a windshield wiper

139
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,400
that moves aside any extra attitude that complicates awareness

140
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,840
any wanting or not wanting judgments

141
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,480
like the windshield becomes for a moment clear

142
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:33,640
so the awareness becomes clear clearly aware of just the breathing

143
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,720
and as we come to the end

144
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,640
to evoke the metaphor of a windshield wiper on a rainy day

145
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,600
we're driving a car and it's raining

146
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,720
we don't talk this way or think this way but there's some truth to it

147
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,799
that as we use the windshield wiper we're trusting

148
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,600
the value of a clear windshield

149
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:38,600
we're trusting how we see when the windshield is cleared over the rain

150
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,679
you can feel the lack of kind of kind of trust or ease

151
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:51,919
if the windshield wiper doesn't work and it's raining hard and we have to really strain to

152
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,880
try to be careful driving probably shouldn't be driving

153
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:03,840
and when we use the windshield wipers to keep the window clear

154
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,440
we are safer driving but also

155
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,080
we become safer for the other drivers and the pedestrians

156
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,840
we offer mutual safety

157
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,320
and so if we are able to clear

158
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:36,880
the window of awareness from our preoccupations our

159
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,399
attitudes our fears our aversions and to respect

160
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:48,080
and trust a clear awareness in the moment

161
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,559
we become safer for ourselves and safer for others

162
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:00,720
in a sense we can give the gift of safety to others

163
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,200
and on this day coming out of this meditation

164
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,158
perhaps we can reflect and consider

165
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:19,840
how we can live so we bring greater safety to others

166
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,320
how can we keep our awareness present attentive

167
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:35,039
clear and simple trusting awareness

168
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,600
respecting our capacity to be aware

169
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,279
and in doing so becoming bringing safety in all

170
00:31:53,279 --> 00:32:00,200
directions it may be more than safety

171
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,640
a dedication to live for the welfare and happiness of

172
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:14,518
others may all beings be happy

173
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:21,919
may all beings be safe may all beings

174
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:28,000
be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

175
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,240
be free

176
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,299
[Music]

177
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,279
so

178
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,880
so continuing today with the

179
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:07,840
discussing mindfulness of the body as part of the overall practice of mindfulness

180
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:15,440
and today it's respect so respecting the body

181
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,280
many years ago i saw an article in i think was mother jones

182
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,960
magazine and it was um the title struck me

183
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:35,679
the title was the body friend foe or total stranger

184
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,040
and so we have complicated relationships to our body and

185
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:48,960
some of it's uh been acculturated into us by the way that our culture relates to the body and

186
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,398
some of it has to do with life experiences and maybe what individuals have told us

187
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,599
about our body and our features and a tremendous amount of suffering

188
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:06,240
goes on in our society that's related to our bodies and uh you know to name just one there's

189
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,079
there's many i mean there's attitudes our culture many cultures have towards skin color

190
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:18,240
body size um height

191
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,000
um you know all kinds of all kinds of things that goes on

192
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,560
and um and so we live under the many of us can live under the weight of

193
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:39,440
thoughts preoccupations about our bodies you know my nose is too big too little my when i was

194
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:46,160
young i was very concerned about having too high a forehead and worried i was going to lose my hair and

195
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,280
in seventh and eighth grade and um

196
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,280
and i would spend an inordinate amount of time in class measuring

197
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:04,320
the distance from my nose to my forehead my my my scalp i would take my

198
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,880
finger like this and and kind of feel the distance to make sure that i wasn't uh you know

199
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:17,359
losing hair um i could probably also write a

200
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:24,079
maybe a somewhat interesting autobiography all from the perspective my of my hair

201
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:31,839
that my hair length what i've done with my hair over these decades of my life from

202
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:38,000
crew cuts when i was a little kid who um long hair

203
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,839
you know halfway down to my belly button uh later in my life and then

204
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,880
a shaved head when i was a monk and on and on

205
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,640
and um so you know what was that going on what was the associations the beliefs the attitudes going on

206
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,839
so all this idea of our bodies and uh

207
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:05,359
and um and so there's often an overlay on top of the body

208
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:11,599
of our judgments and ideas or preoccupations and one of the things that's possible maybe

209
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,960
discover the exercise of the hand that i gave in this last guided meditation

210
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:23,520
is to experience a difference between the hands experience of itself

211
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:30,320
and our ideas of the hand so the idea is my anger my fingers are too long too short my fingernails are

212
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,839
this or that or my hand is chubby or too whatever it might be

213
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:41,359
it can be kind of debilitating and depressing even some of these ideas and thoughts

214
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:47,839
but the hand itself doesn't have those thoughts and ideas the hand itself it just feels itself

215
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:53,920
what it is it has no judgments about what it is and to it's a tremendously respectful

216
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:00,480
for the hand to leave it alone to free it from our judgments ideas associations

217
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,720
and to experience the hand or whatever part of the body whatever's going on in our body independent of the culturation

218
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:15,200
independent of the life experiences even and the judgments the ideas and how we've been treated

219
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,640
and um and part of mindfulness practice is to give ourselves the gift give our body

220
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,480
the gift of allowing it to experience itself independent of all these other

221
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:33,680
comparisons we make comparisons with other kinds of hands what it should be and not be and um

222
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,838
you know there are um you know if um

223
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,960
you know if you know if i might feel you know because i'm hanging out with a certain group of people i might feel bad

224
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,800
about myself for being too short and just oh you know i'm too short and this is unfortunate and there are people

225
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,560
looking down at me all the time and you know i have to look up high and and it just happens to be that i'm

226
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:06,320
hanging out with the national basketball association basketball players and um and so in comparison i'm short

227
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,960
but you know in comparison to many people in our culture our society i'm a little bit tall but i kind of make a story and get

228
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,800
caught up in it these differences and comparisons cause a lot of suffering and i don't want to

229
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,960
dismiss and the suffering and the challenges that all this makes

230
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,839
we need to address it wisely but in meditation we can give ourselves the gift of

231
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:39,200
experience the body in and of itself free of all that if we really want to respect the body

232
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:46,800
we want to somehow be able to distinguish between the judgments the stories the commentary the associations

233
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,480
that we pile on top of the body from the body's experience of itself

234
00:39:52,480 --> 00:40:00,079
which is often very simple and that can also be relevant when there's pain discomfort in the body

235
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:05,920
that uh we have predictions that oh if this continues you know i'll have to my knee pain i'll have to

236
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,839
amputate my leg and it'll be the end somehow and certainly there are dangers with the

237
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,760
body being uncomfortable in pain but sometimes there's not

238
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,000
one of the great things that can happen through the heightened sensitivity the respect of the body by really paying

239
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,200
attention to it in meditation is we can tell the difference between

240
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:35,599
pain that is a danger signal and pain which is not

241
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,680
and if it's a danger signal then change your posture but i'll by all means don't don't live with a danger if you're in

242
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:49,119
doubt of what it is change your posture don't stay with pain that way but if there's no danger signal

243
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,720
um i like to think of the the you know the pain is a signal there's a

244
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:02,480
message and part of that message is not that something needs to be changed that we have to do something but

245
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,880
rather the message is that we can offer it the medicine of awareness

246
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:16,000
to hold it in awareness um and then so part of this respecting awareness that we did in that last

247
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,200
meditation is that the awareness with which we hold

248
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,440
discomfort and pain needs to be simple needs to not be piled on with these

249
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,359
judgments associations fears ideas of self that kind of makes it so

250
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:40,160
much more complicated very simple awareness so for example uh if um if someone goes

251
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:48,240
around with a clenched hand because they're afraid or angry or something uh you could come with a maybe a play a

252
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:54,000
crowbar or something and kind of try to open up the fingers you get one open and then when you start the other one the

253
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,040
first one closes up again and you're kind of like kind of like

254
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:06,160
directly trying to fight the clenchedness another way to do it is to come along

255
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:12,240
with a loving soft caring hand and hold the person's hand and support it

256
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,280
and just let it just tell them here rest in my hand

257
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,280
feel your weight and let it kind of rest and settle into my hand and then slowly

258
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,960
people's hands will begin to open because they feel the support and the care

259
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,240
so the same way we can do for ourselves that as we bring our awareness

260
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:41,520
to the area of tension or pain perhaps what we're doing is allowing something to thaw something to relax and

261
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:48,160
open work we're maybe bringing making space for the body's ability to heal

262
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,160
to heal itself just like you know if the tight clan clenched fist

263
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:01,440
is kind of the i don't know what to call it but this metaphor the illness then we're holding it so that it can it

264
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,720
can so that's the medicine so it can release and relax itself

265
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,720
and perhaps it's not always relaxation maybe it's just simply that bringing a lot of attention to an area brings more

266
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,000
blood to it or the micro tensions around it relax

267
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,200
or we begin seeing that the experience of discomfort in and

268
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:30,000
of itself is different very different experience if we just feel it in and of itself

269
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,359
then if we see it through the filter of our ideas even the idea that it's pain

270
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:44,079
is kind of an abstraction oddly enough and when you really feel it directly

271
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:50,000
it's not you know realize that pain is an abstraction what's really happening is

272
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,960
there are sensations of heat or stabbing or pulling or tightness or pressure or

273
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:03,040
strong contraction and all these kinds of particular sensations that are intense

274
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,400
but they are all kinds of different sensations and we start feeling the particularity

275
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,920
of it then we're not overlaying an idea like pain which comes along with

276
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,520
a lot of baggage a lot of other ideas about what pain means some people experience

277
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,560
associate pain with failure i'm doing something wrong and that's a little bit debilitating to

278
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:30,800
have that idea and um and so just to feel feel it and be with

279
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:36,800
it the and then as we feel more deeply into

280
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:43,440
discomfort for example uh there might be a message there and that message might be that uh

281
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,599
maybe there's some some uh embodied emotion in that place stored up

282
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:56,079
from long time ago that maybe needs to be released and maybe it comes gets released with tears maybe it gets

283
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:01,839
released with heat or something else but it's i think it's nice within this

284
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:08,240
respect of the body respecting the body to think that there's a very huge difference between

285
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,440
the corporal body that we have when we're a corpse and the

286
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:19,839
animated body and the body that has sensations in it

287
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:27,920
and um and the sensate body is i like to think of it as a

288
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:34,400
messenger system it's always there to inform us about something

289
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,560
so and foremost you know simple as it's hot outside or cold take off your sweater put on your

290
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:47,040
sweater but everything is a message and and how do we read that message

291
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:52,720
and with mindfulness meditation it isn't so much that we're actively reading it

292
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:58,400
but we're allowing this respectful careful simple awareness to hold the

293
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:05,040
experience to be with experience so that we get to know it better and something

294
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:10,720
begins to happen the self-healing functions of the body can operate the message system of the body can

295
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:16,400
reveal something to us more deeply the and maybe what we're learning is not

296
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,440
necessarily about the discomfort or the pleasure that we might feel

297
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:28,480
but rather we're learning that the message is you're not free in relationship to it

298
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,800
you're caught up in it you're somehow attached to it or aversive to it and your awareness is not free your

299
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,880
awareness is not in that place of freedom and simplicity and that's where the work is that's what the message is

300
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:47,040
that that comes back to us so to respect the body

301
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,680
and and so in the instructions that we have here at imc

302
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:59,280
is to stay with your breathing that's the default that's where we develop some concentration

303
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,760
but at a moment's notice if some experience of the body is more predominant more compelling

304
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,280
which means that there's a tension set up between trying to stay with the breathing and this

305
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:18,160
other sensation the body kind of calling attention to itself you can just let go of

306
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:24,400
the breathing and then see if you can bring calmly deliberately a clear

307
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,920
simple awareness to hang out for a while to hold for a while this compelling

308
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:36,960
sensation whether it's pleasant or unpleasant and when it's no longer compelling you can either continue to be aware of it if

309
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:44,640
it feels like the right thing or you can come back to your breathing so respecting your body

310
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:50,319
it's definitely worth it and a friend foe or total stranger

311
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:56,480
i would a wonderful thing that can happen as we do this practice is our body becomes our friend

312
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:02,880
and we become its friend so may that friendship last for a long time
