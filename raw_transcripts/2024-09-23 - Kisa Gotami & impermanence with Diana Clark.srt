1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,520
good morning maybe uh let's see I'm G to do a little sound check how does the volume

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,639
sound this does it sound okay sound okay yes as Martha said I teach on Monday

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:20,240
nights and hard to believe it's been many many years well many maybe four years now I've been doing uh Monday

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,680
nights that's a lot of Mondays and uh here I am on a Sunday

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,559
sitting in for Gil while he's H teaching a retreat down at

6
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:37,760
IRC and I also want to thank you to oh thank you welcome you to Autumn right

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:45,520
today is uh the first day of the Equinox the sun passed directly over the Equator

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:53,399
this morning so it's you know roughly the same length of day and night starting

9
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,640
today so this morning I'd like to share a story that's uh from the Buddhist

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,600
tradition from this tradition um I first heard this story many many years ago and

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:14,320
it troubled me a little bit um and so I recently saw somebody

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:23,079
that had um kind like uh fleshed out some of the details of this story a little bit more in modern terms and um I

13
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:28,640
then it was really then I could start to feel and sense some of the the teachings

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,680
and what's valuable about this story instead of kind just being dismissive of

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,079
it or just like oh that's from thousands of years ago who cares instead to realize oh no no no there's something

16
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,920
here something for me and I hope maybe something all for all of you too about this

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,880
story so maybe I'll just say for those of you who uh care about these things or

18
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,840
know about these things this story is from the commentarial tradition which is a thousand maybe about a thousand years

19
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,080
after the time of the Buddha some of you may know that Gil and I have been teaching the sutas we've been we've

20
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,120
spent a lot of time uh doing the sutas and that's you know attributed to closer to the time of the Buddha and this story

21
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,720
is after that time so this is a story of Kisa

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,599
goami and this is a woman and she came from a poor

23
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:36,360
household and she was uh very thin and frail and because she was thin and frail

24
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,879
people called her Kissa which we can translate as skinny you know so skinny

25
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:48,080
gotami is uh what they were calling her but uh as it happened she married

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:56,239
into a family that um had more wealth than the family she came from and however the in-laws didn't like

27
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,680
her they uh disrespected her and treated her

28
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,519
poorly that is until she gave birth to a

29
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,239
son and as it happened this son this was the first child the first grandchild and

30
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,879
there was a boy so and you know this happens even in modern times that inls

31
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:26,599
don't get along with the some of the the children- in-laws but then when there's

32
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:32,400
a birth of a child like the Dynamics often change there can be a way in which uh things

33
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,080
are a little bit different and then so with the birth of uh her son her in-laws started to treat

34
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,120
her better more respectfully and she was a really good

35
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:51,439
mother she took good care of her son and this was noticed by the in-laws

36
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:59,840
and noticed by other people in the village as well so maybe they still called her Kissa gotami but just because

37
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,480
was her name but maybe it wasn't so much with derision it was just more because that was what they knew her

38
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,040
by so her life had changed and she felt like things were going

39
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,320
well she had this child that she loved and was

40
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,040
thriving and then soon after her son had learned to

41
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,080
walk she and her son were out for a little walk in the village and the sun

42
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,800
tripped and fell and didn't get

43
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,919
up and Kissa grabbed the Sun and pulled him up but he was just

44
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:51,280
limp thinking oh my goodness he's unconscious that must have been a terrible fall what can I do so she kind

45
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,120
of like you know hits him on his face and uh tries to wake him up but he's still not waking

46
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:05,520
up she's completely destroyed God please wake up wake up and the sun doesn't wake

47
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,160
up and she picks up the Sun and takes home thinking that the relatives will be

48
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:18,960
able to you know help her her family will be able to help her and her child her son who just needs to be revived and

49
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:27,479
then soon everything will be okay and she could go back to the life that she had just if only her son would just wake

50
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,919
up so in her anguish and in her grief and trying to figure things out she

51
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,080
wasn't able to see that actually her son had

52
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:45,199
died she couldn't quite take that in couldn't quite process it so she's

53
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:51,919
running back home when she gets there the in-laws see

54
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:58,880
oh my goodness this is uh this is really bad and she's like you there must be

55
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,680
some medicine what can you do help him help him he just needs to wake

56
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,240
up and they were trying to explain to her he's not going to wake up and she's

57
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:20,240
like no no you don't understand clearly you don't see and they tried to reason with her

58
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,720
but uh she was couldn't be reasoned with she was convinced that simply if they

59
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:34,039
could just see things her way that they would understand that to he needs some special medicine or need something to

60
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:40,280
help bring him back and and some thought okay well maybe we just console her and say it's going to be all right can you

61
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:47,560
just relax and she was like what do you mean relax no that's

62
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:54,160
urgent have to take care of things now

63
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,360
so maybe I'll say that uh I'll pause here with a little bit of a commentary

64
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:09,440
and the version of the story that I heard initially it just talked about how Kisa gotami was crazy she went

65
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,240
crazy and I thought well I you know I don't know about that it just kind of

66
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,639
like was just wrote her off as crazy but then when you start to think about it

67
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,680
something that had made I mean a child right I mean this there aren't many things that are much worse than this

68
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:33,360
right a child dying and then you add on top of that something that had really turned around

69
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,960
her life had made such a big difference in her life and then to see it just gone

70
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,680
in a blink of a moment I mean there's a way in which we

71
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:54,159
ourselves do this things that are important to us that are very meaningful us and then they they

72
00:07:54,159 --> 00:08:02,319
change they go away there's a way in which there's this

73
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:09,000
um there's a way in which I mean like how would we feel it's devastating it's

74
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,560
devastating and there can be some times in which society likes to tell us or

75
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:23,039
maybe we even tell ourselves like oh you shouldn't you shouldn't be upset about that just go on with uh life or oh it's

76
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,120
not really that bad there's a way and sometimes we Gaslight ourselves like oh

77
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,839
it's not that bad I know somebody that was telling me that

78
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,680
uh this one of her her dog had died and it was devastating for her because her

79
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,519
and this dog had been through so many life changes together and so many things together and and people were telling her

80
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:53,200
like get over it it was just a pet and she was so really really hurt by

81
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:00,279
this and what are that some of the other things like we're talking of a child here this is devastating a fur family

82
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:07,120
member is devastating but there's also things about like our youth our

83
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:14,120
capabilities our jobs you know there's some of these things that when they go away that we

84
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,440
tend to not really uh understand and instead want to just ignore and uh

85
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:28,240
frantically look for something to restore it to return it so it's not so much that kisak goami

86
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,200
was crazy she just wasn't quite ready I mean this is devast I keep on

87
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,800
using this word devastating I can't think of a better word right now that you know to what's so

88
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:46,519
important to see it slip away we don't want to see it slip away

89
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:52,519
we want to deny it

90
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:58,360
so getting back to the story so kakami so her family wasn't helping so she

91
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:06,120
thought okay there might must be other people in the village here who understand so um she carrying her son

92
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:13,600
who's not alive came her son this is just heartbreaking right going to the uh

93
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,079
neighbors please can you help him and uh they were trying to talk some sense into

94
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:24,600
her quote unquote and like no no no there's no help for your son I'm sorry

95
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,720
and she's like oh I don't know I'm going to the next door and the next door and nobody's was able to convince her until

96
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,000
finally she gets to this house of um some of the

97
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:43,959
elders and uh the Elder she understood what was happening here she

98
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:49,720
she could see what was happening and kutam was asking for medicine for her

99
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,800
son and the Elder recognized there isn't medicine for her son but maybe there's

100
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,240
medicine for her and so the Elder she said toisa gami

101
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:09,839
said to there's a doctor some call him the Buddha he's nearby why don't you go see

102
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,120
him he probably has medicine so kisak goami is like

103
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,680
delighted finally here's somebody who's paying attention to her who's uh not

104
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,839
being dismissive and trying to pretend like something terrible isn't happening

105
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:32,639
and instead is giving her some direction something to do so kisag goami hurriedly goes to the

106
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:40,040
ddha to the Buddha and um she goes to the Buddha and

107
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:46,519
says I beg you please give me the medicine which I need to wake my child

108
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:53,760
from his sleep and straight away the Buddha understood what was

109
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,000
happening and he replies good woman I do have some medicine for for

110
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,680
you but in order for this medicine to work you need to obtain a small quantity

111
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,160
of mustard seed from a house in the city and Cas a good time is like okay no problem Mustard Seed from some of the

112
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:21,199
neighbors I can do this but wait you must obtain a small quantity of

113
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:28,760
mustard seed from a house in the city where no one has died from a house in the city where no

114
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:35,959
one has has ever lost a loved one k said thinks

115
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:42,160
okay so she goes to the next House nearby and says do you have some Mustard Seed and she's still carrying her son

116
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,519
and the I can only imagine what the neighbors word imagine when she knocks on the door and they see this and

117
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:56,040
they're like yeah here let me go get it and they get the mustard seed and they give it to her and she's like oh great

118
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,720
thank you oh and by the way has anybody died in this household

119
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:09,480
yes my grandmother just died last month oh she gives the Mustard Seed back goes

120
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,720
to the next house do you have any mustard seed yes oh thank you they go to

121
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:22,399
get it they bring it and has anyone died yes my cousin died last

122
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:30,440
week oh so then you know how the story's going to go right she's going to go to the house after house they have Mustard

123
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:38,040
Seed and they also have death she's able to find Mustard Seed a

124
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:44,720
common cooking ingredient but uh isn't able to find a

125
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,399
houseold that hasn't been touched by tragedy that hasn't been touched by the

126
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,639
loss of a loved one there's this

127
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:03,759
way that um humans will do almost anything to not

128
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:09,320
feel helpless they will do almost anything in

129
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,560
order to not feel like things are out of control to not feel like oh my gosh this

130
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,839
is awful it has to be different and I have to make it be

131
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:27,600
different so the Elder and the Buddha they uh respected kisami they met her

132
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,839
where she was and a State just uh highly

133
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:39,959
agitated not seen clearly and recognize that it's actually

134
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:45,480
through experience when our minds get

135
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,160
changed very often it's through when we recognize something for ourselves

136
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,560
instead of just being told it especially these days right with social media you

137
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,800
can find anything you want on the internet that you can you can find any point of view you want if you look hard

138
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:10,759
enough you can find anything so it's hard to like have confidence in what people are telling us

139
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:17,040
not only just because you can find any point of view you'd like but it's different right it's different when we

140
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,320
have an experience and we know things in a different

141
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,040
way when my father died a number of years ago I I mean of course I understood that people died but it

142
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,160
wasn't until they died that I I understood it like deeply inside like oh

143
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:46,240
yeah this this is this is what it means when people die it's a different ex then is somebody

144
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:53,399
telling you right there's a difference between what we intellectually understand and what we know from

145
00:15:53,399 --> 00:16:01,160
experience and that Buddha he know he knows this he's pointing to direct experience so so much in the teachings

146
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,839
this is partly why we meditate so that we can quiet the mind and just be with

147
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:15,759
our experience instead of being completely lost in our thoughts which spin any way and every which

148
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:23,079
way so Kisa goami coming back to the story she's starting to have an

149
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:29,920
experience she's starting to recognize oh I'm it's not like there's a

150
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:36,240
malfunction in the universe that I'm having this uh terrible terrible

151
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,600
experience but instead other people have this too

152
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:48,880
instead this is part of the human condition that there's terrible

153
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:56,880
loss there difficulties nobody is exempt nobody not

154
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,360
me not you not anybody and we know this right the

155
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,400
Buddha talks about this as the first Noble Truth there is

156
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:13,480
suffering but there's sometimes a way in which we're kind of secretly thinking at least I know I have for a lot of time

157
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:20,678
yeah okay that's for other people there's a way in which we think oh this something wrong with me or I

158
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:27,240
failed or very commonly whose fault is it I have to blame somebody and first we

159
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,760
often well not always for some people they like to blame outside and for some people they like to blame inside

160
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,159
ourselves or blame others but this idea of

161
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:45,919
blaming and it's quite something for me when I uh encounter the news and uh the

162
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,600
different formats that it's available it seems to me it's always about blame

163
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,440
breaking news this happened and we're trying to find who to blame this happened and here's who to blame and

164
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,120
this happened and these people are blaming that and I'm not saying we shouldn't hold people responsible I'm

165
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,799
not saying that I am saying just notice how this kind of like this wish to blame

166
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:15,039
is often just a way to distract ourselves or divert ourselves from this

167
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:21,600
feeling of helplessness from this feeling like oh yeah these things are happening out

168
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:29,360
there these terrible things that we can't control and it doesn't feel good

169
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:38,640
but there's a way in which there maybe having the experience like turning

170
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,200
towards experience as best we can to be able to

171
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:52,559
hold it with as much spaciousness as we're able

172
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:59,440
to when I first heard this expression from somebody else I thought it was peculiar but now I started to see it

173
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:06,520
this idea of gaslighting ourselves the way that we kind of want to Discount ourselves or talk ourselves out of some

174
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:13,440
difficulty or this isn't a problem get over it or something like that or the way that we want to be dismissive and

175
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:22,360
avoid things but is there a way that we can

176
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:29,280
recognize that yeah there's really hard things that happen in our lives

177
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,080
lives difficult things and not only in our lives in everybody's

178
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:42,640
lives the peculiarities the distinctions are different but every single one of us has

179
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,520
difficulties and it makes absolutely zero sense no sense at all to like

180
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:55,799
compare it's just all of us have difficulties and there's something

181
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:03,799
about meeting that and ack in that and saying yes this is the truth of

182
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:09,360
the moment ESP best we can and so what is

183
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,159
one way that we can do that is to tune into the bodily

184
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:21,720
experience this is uh a sense of Despair and it feels like heaviness in the

185
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,679
shoulders and maybe there's a lump in the throat or um tightness in the belly

186
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,760
or something like this or maybe there's just like oh there's this feeling of helplessness and

187
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:42,480
overwhelm and then maybe you just feel your feet on the ground just feeling connected and grounded this way this

188
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,840
way there's a way in which being with the body can be such a support because

189
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:56,640
it interrupts the momentum of all the all the catastrophizing or the

190
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,320
spinning out that we can do some of us don't like to be in the body or feel a little bit disconnected to the

191
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,840
body so this is why I offer just being grounded just feeling your feet on the ground don't

192
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:15,480
underestimate how this simple thing can make such a difference but when I was working in

193
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:22,520
Corporate America I uh learned that this was something that I could do like when I was in a meeting that was going

194
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:28,559
south just somehow like feeling my feet on the ground made such a huge difference from me not to like get

195
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,919
pulled into The Fray and want to I don't know defend myself or or

196
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:41,080
uh assert uh myself in some kind of way that would have been

197
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,480
unhelpful so getting back to this story about Kisa

198
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:58,640
goami after a while she realized she wasn't going to find a house that was Untouched by death or by tragedy

199
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,919
and she couldn't help noticing how many houses in fact had lost a

200
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:14,840
child and then maybe at the end of the day she decided that um she was going to

201
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,320
go back to the Buddha and talk to

202
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:29,320
him so she was still feeling the pain of her loss it's not like she no longer was

203
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,520
was no longer devastated or was no longer feeling

204
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:45,440
sad but she goes to the Buddha and she Ed a

205
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:53,720
verse this is a common in the suas that uh when individuals have a a conversation with

206
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,880
the Buddha they might say something piy that gets captured in verse so here's a

207
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:07,080
verse uh that kakami says to the Buddha it's not just a truth for one

208
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,840
Village or town nor is it a truth for a single

209
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:18,400
family but for every World settled by gods and

210
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,559
humans impermanence indeed is what is

211
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:32,799
true endings changes is this is true for all of us is true

212
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:38,760
for everybody everything it's a part of us that know this today is the first day

213
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:47,360
of fall right it's the new season summer is ending fall is I guess

214
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,520
technically here this something about noticing

215
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:00,279
impermanence in particular is liberating

216
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:08,080
the Buddha after he first uh became awakened some of you might know this story that uh he went and taught the his

217
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,200
five former Companions and they had practiced extreme aestheticism together

218
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,080
the Buddha abandoned the aestheticism and went and sat under the bod tree and

219
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,240
eventually became awakened these five people had um continued on with their

220
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:31,159
aestheticism after he becomes awakened he wants to teach them what he discovered so he finds them and he

221
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:37,559
teaches them and the first person to become awakened after the Buddha became awakened his name is

222
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:44,200
Kon and um after kund becomes awakened he utters whatever

223
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:53,120
is subject to arising is subject to cessation whatever comes to be and

224
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:59,320
ceases it's this impermanence that kund is saying also is like a key insight for

225
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,960
him that helped him to kind of let go of uh the difficulties and anything that he

226
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,440
was holding on to that led to Liberation and then this is a part of

227
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:17,799
the story that's also captured uh in the vinia this is in the polyan after these five Aesthetics the

228
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:25,960
Buddha goes to uh teach the exact opposite of Aesthetics a very wealthy uh

229
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:32,039
Merchant his name is yasa and the Buddha encounters yasa through a

230
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:39,080
short little story then gives him um the teachings yasa becomes awakened yasa he

231
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:47,720
says whatever is subject to arising is subject to cessation after his Awakening

232
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:56,960
experience so there's something about recognizing that things arise and pass away they're not always you know uh

233
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,000
permanent in the way that we think they are everything is always

234
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,679
changing sometimes there's giant changes like the loss of a child and sometimes there are subtle

235
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:18,559
changes but there's a way to acknowledge this allows us to maybe align ourselves

236
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:24,279
with the reality of the moment instead of just holding on to yeah but it used

237
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:30,360
to be like this that's turns out not to be so helpful to be grasping onto a past

238
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:36,919
or something like this but instead to be able to recognize oh yeah okay things are

239
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:45,720
different now and it's okay to feel really sad of course there's grief of course

240
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,480
there's grief when there's loss can we allow the grief to be there

241
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,200
can we allow it to be experienced and can we allow it to move through us when

242
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,880
the time is right without identifying with it and saying okay I'm the person that's been sad for

243
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:12,240
x amount of time I'm always going to be sad and nobody understands instead can we allow the experience to be there and

244
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,520
as best we can feel it in the body again this interrupts the momentum

245
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:24,480
of the mind that's making all these stories about how things should be and if only that hadn't happened and I'm

246
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:31,720
going to blame this person or blame myself instead can we just be with what's actually

247
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:37,080
happening the tears the heat in the

248
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:44,279
face all of us have cried with loss all of us have had loss it's part of the

249
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:51,080
human experience when we think of impermanence

250
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:56,640
we tend to focus on the challenging aspects of it just as I have but there's

251
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:03,159
also a way in which things ending or changing um allows us to put things in

252
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:09,640
perspective it's sometimes when something is lost that that can be like kind of like a reset button and we start

253
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:16,279
to rethink our priorities like wow I didn't realize how much I was taking that for granted I didn't realize how

254
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:22,320
important that was for me and now that it's no longer here it's awful and then

255
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:29,600
we start to maybe look at our life in a way that we hadn't before and maybe there is some resetting

256
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:36,679
of priorities and a wish to make some amends for example or to live life more

257
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:44,000
fully for example or to be less disconnected just lost in Doom scrolling

258
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,880
or in our social media echo echo Chambers or something like

259
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:57,480
this and then this is something that's uh obvious once we think about it it's

260
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,640
only because of impermanence it's only because of things change that allows

261
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:10,720
growth to happen that allows cultivation to happen that allows uh some change in

262
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,679
our spiritual lives changes in our lives that are supportive and help us to find more freedom help us to find more peace

263
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:24,000
and ease that's only possible because of this change the same change that allows

264
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,880
growth is the same change that is allowing other things that we didn't want to go away to go

265
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:38,519
away and there's a way in which US humans myself included we want to think

266
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:43,880
that we know like okay well in order for me to have happiness and freedom I need

267
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,200
this and I don't need that like we have this clear idea maybe it's not uh

268
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:56,440
explicit or maybe it's uh subtle but like okay I need this and I don't need that I just uh need to meditate more

269
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:02,159
clearly and uh I don't need um a difficult

270
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:08,000
body or I don't need this neighbor's dog that uh incessantly barks or you know

271
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,440
whatever it might be I need to read all the sutas uh I'll give you a short cut I've

272
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:21,120
read probably all the [Laughter] suas and they're deeply meaningful for

273
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,399
me they have impacted me deeply but that's not a requirement I'll just save

274
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,960
you guys some time

275
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:39,440
but there's this way that we have this idea that we have this think we knew like what's needed and what's not needed

276
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:46,399
but turns out that we don't really know we have firm ideas of what we like and

277
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,960
what we don't like that's true but do we really know what's going to help us bring the most Freedom we

278
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,440
don't we think we do and certainly are preferences right I mean there there for

279
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:04,760
a reason but if we only followed our preferences then that's a way in which

280
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:12,120
we're clinging and that's a way in which we're identifying and that's not a way in which we can find more and more

281
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:21,080
freedom so there's this way in which wisdom comes from seeing this impermanence deeper and deeper and

282
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:27,039
deeper ways I gave this story about the obvious

283
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,159
loss and an ending but there's a way in which can we

284
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:39,320
see how just the changing nature of everything turns

285
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:48,760
out and is that a way that can help us to not hold on so tightly not to be um

286
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:58,039
wishing like this has to stay and this has to go instead I first saw Gil do this quite

287
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:04,320
so many years ago I don't remember when but I'm sure you've seen him do this too this idea right if we hold on to things

288
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,039
like oh I need this and we're holding on to this for example I'm holding this Striker so tightly but uh can we hold

289
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:16,679
them like this with an open hand just sometimes for me like when I

290
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:21,919
first saw this visual I felt like oh yeah it's not like okay I have to get

291
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,080
rid of it right now there's a way in which we can just hold it with an open

292
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:34,120
hand it being whatever is arising whatever your experience is including the really

293
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,679
difficult ones can we hold it care for it respect

294
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,720
it honor it instead of trying to get rid of whatever is

295
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:51,399
happening that is the way forward that is the way towards greater Freedom

296
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:58,919
greater peace greater well-being is to honor and respect our experience

297
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:03,559
including the changing nature of

298
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,919
experience and through this we can find greater and greater

299
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:17,760
Freedom maybe I'll Circle back around to this story with Kisa

300
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:24,600
goami so after she meets with the Buddha she has this realization she asks to

301
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,799
ordain for her she now that has seen something deeply she wants to devote her

302
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:36,720
life to practice you don't have to ordain to devote your life to practice or to have practice be uh essential part

303
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:44,760
of your life or even a marginal part of your life so she asks to join um the

304
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:52,360
monastics and the uh Buddha allows her to do so and or ordains her I should say and

305
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:59,080
then as The Story Goes she becomes an our Hut and becomes a completely awakened person

306
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,720
and she her uh some of her uh verses her Awakening vers when she becomes

307
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:11,240
completely awakened is preserved in the terata and regrettably I don't have her

308
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,760
verses in front of me here something that I didn't make it onto this uh sheet

309
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,679
here this morning but there's something uh for me that I just appreciate so much

310
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:31,118
that uh just somebody who was having difficulties and maybe felt like you know world was ending but uh found a way

311
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,760
found a different way and found complete Freedom complete

312
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,358
peace so with that I wish you all a wonderful day today the first day of

313
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:49,560
autumn may you notice also the changing nature of your experience and to honor

314
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,000
and respect and care for your experience and as best you can also like

315
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
feel in the body the bodily experience cuz the mind sometimes is telling us

316
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,800
stories telling us stories thank you
