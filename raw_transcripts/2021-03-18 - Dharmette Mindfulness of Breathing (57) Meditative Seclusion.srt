1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,759
so related to the

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,280
topic of absorption that what we talked

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,880
about what i talked about in the guided

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,759
meditation just now

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,800
a a concept that the buddha refers to

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,880
often in terms of meditation practice

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,600
and this

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,720
path of liberation

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,160
is the idea of

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,359
often translated into english is

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,840
seclusion

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,559
and the word for seclusion viveka

13
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,559
v-i-v-e-k-a

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,879
more literally means to separate

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,640
something apart becomes separate

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,360
but in the context seclusion is probably

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,120
one of the better english words no

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,680
english words really work well but the

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,039
probably a better english

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,160
word if we associate seclusion

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,520
with being sheltered being protected

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,878
kind of cozy and nice and

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,280
secluded in the best possible kind of

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
associations of that word

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,960
cozy and warm and contented

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,600
deep feeling of satisfaction just being

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,000
here

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,680
secluded or somehow maybe after

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,960
a you know a long

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,640
walk and big invigorating nice walk in

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,920
the cold

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,400
maybe even stormy weather and coming

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,119
inside

34
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,360
and wrapping in a nice blanket and

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,400
having

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,040
a warm drink and just being all cozy and

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,079
alone and feel secluded from all the

38
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,159
difficulties of life around us maybe

39
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,399
something like that

40
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,560
so the word seclusion and

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,720
it's used in the buddhist teachings for

42
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,000
a variety of different

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,040
forms of seclusion and

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,119
the the first kind of gives us begins

45
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,640
giving us a sense of

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,840
what it's what's to come and it means

47
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,000
it's used to defer to going on retreat

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,520
they don't have the word retreat in in

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,560
ancient language but they say uh going

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,400
to be secluded

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,959
to be secluded is to go someplace where

52
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,160
you're separate from the

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,920
some people might say that it's a

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,400
process of escaping the world and

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,640
and the real world we have to face the

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,000
real world

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,520
but the what's more real

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,920
in terms of our mind and hearts is

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,319
becoming integrated not being fragmented

60
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:34,720
and

61
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,560
being pulled in all kinds of directions

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,360
and thoughts and feelings and everything

63
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
and so the process of meditation going

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,959
in physically

65
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,120
becoming secluded from many of the

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,640
aspects of the world

67
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,840
so we can find this inner health inner

68
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,680
wholesomeness and integration

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,319
process so we bring back that back into

70
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,599
the world

71
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,840
and it isn't pushing the world the world

72
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,519
away or abandoning it

73
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,400
any more than going alone and being

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,159
secluded in your bathroom to take a

75
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,200
shower

76
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,360
is pushing away the world and rejecting

77
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,400
the world

78
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,800
and take a shower and become clean and

79
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,159
we become you know

80
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,680
more it's more we're more of a

81
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
pleasant person to be with in the world

82
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,200
if we're clean and

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,239
and taken care of that way and

84
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,000
uh so uh so this is meditative seclusion

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,519
going off on retreat

86
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,200
and in the old days it was going into

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
the forest perhaps in some place where

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,440
the

89
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,000
people could be alone some people might

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,080
just be in your own room by yourself

91
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,560
in the early morning and maybe you get

92
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,159
up before everyone else and you feel

93
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,000
have this wonderful benefit of seclusion

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,640
just

95
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,159
nothing else to think about and be

96
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,480
involved in just here

97
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,159
practicing and um and then it's easier

98
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,159
to get absorbed it's easier easier to an

99
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,159
integration that wholeness and just the

100
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,000
satisfaction the contentment of being

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,560
this way of real and then settling in

102
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,599
and being

103
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,959
and then we become more and more

104
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,200
secluded and

105
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,840
and the meditative seclusion happens

106
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,040
when

107
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,159
we stop being so concerned

108
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,480
with the past and the future and the

109
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,000
thoughts don't take us spinning

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,720
out in other places and other times and

111
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,720
and we're secluded from those

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,359
um uh external thoughts thoughts that

113
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,280
kind of spin us away

114
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,720
and if we are thinking it's thoughts

115
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,840
that keep us here and connected and

116
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
involved as we get more absorbed in

117
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,919
meditation more connected and involved

118
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,120
in it and

119
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,400
you know really sink into it and then

120
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,919
um there's sensory seclusion that

121
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,199
happens

122
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,080
that uh sometimes we don't really

123
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,840
involved in hearing so much

124
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,280
or smelling or seeing or

125
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,600
even even some of the sensing of the

126
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,479
body

127
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,400
precedes and disappears sometimes people

128
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,600
the body becomes very

129
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,440
transparent or light or seems to have no

130
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,680
edges to the body or even the whole body

131
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,199
seems to disappear

132
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,960
because we're not we're not really

133
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,639
giving attention

134
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,680
to um the senses you know the six the

135
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,000
five

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,320
senses of of uh hearing seeing touching

137
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,600
um smelling tasting

138
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,960
and um and so those all we see

139
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,440
we still have the capacity to hear and

140
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,199
taste and do all these things

141
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,080
but they recede from where our attention

142
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,720
is we're

143
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,919
absorbed in what we're involved in and

144
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,680
just like we would perhaps reading a

145
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,440
really good book

146
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,800
and you don't hear people talking

147
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
anymore you don't notice the sounds

148
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,320
outside the house because you're so

149
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,919
absorbed in the in the book

150
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,400
there's a sensory seclusion and that

151
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,840
sensory seclusion

152
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,199
because there's absorption going on it's

153
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,080
uh it you know it feels really good it's

154
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,479
like

155
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,720
we're being pulled in we're being

156
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,479
absorbed we're being delighted we're

157
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,000
being enjoying we're really

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,160
the attention really is getting centered

159
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,280
in here

160
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,400
um because it's starting to get

161
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,440
concentrated and very present

162
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,280
as it does so and the mind becomes

163
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,039
quieter and stiller

164
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,600
one of the functions of this is for us

165
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,919
to become more sensitive to clinging

166
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,600
to grasping to how the mind gets

167
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,240
attached how the mind contracts

168
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,360
and um and uh and the more

169
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,919
still more absorbed more peaceful we can

170
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:24,720
become

171
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,560
the more sensitive we become to the

172
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,160
slightest movements of

173
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,319
contraction of clinging of resistance

174
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,520
that goes on

175
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,960
in the mind in the heart and so then we

176
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,639
have the opportunity then to let go of

177
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:36,960
that

178
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,039
or bring our attention to that and have

179
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,280
it let go of itself

180
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,120
and and uh and then over time

181
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,880
there becomes a seclusion from the

182
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,639
things we cling to

183
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,400
one of the important steps for this

184
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,240
process of seclusion

185
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,960
is to be secluded from to be separated

186
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,120
from not involved in anymore

187
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,919
with the five hindrances of of sensual

188
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,560
desire

189
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,759
ill will sloth interpret restlessness

190
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,880
and regrets and doubt because we're so

191
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,199
absorbed so connected so involved with

192
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,720
what we're doing with meditation like

193
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,840
really absorb

194
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,680
kind of dipping deep into the into the

195
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,080
world the ocean of breathing that um

196
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,280
that we're not you know we're not get

197
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,599
pulled into those it can be part of this

198
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,039
contentment and satisfaction of

199
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,080
meditation

200
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,000
is not to be involved anymore with the

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,199
hindrances

202
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,800
so we're secluded from them we're

203
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,400
separated from them as the ancient

204
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,880
language

205
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,160
and and that's temporary so

206
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,639
in deep meditation that that can those

207
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,000
fall away

208
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,080
but then they come back when we come out

209
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,759
of meditation their mind is no longer

210
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,680
concentrated

211
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,960
and maybe they come back a little bit

212
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,039
weaker than they were before

213
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,280
but sooner or later they'll come back

214
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,280
and then the ultimate seclusion

215
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,759
is their separation is when we become

216
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,319
more

217
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,160
permanently separated from some of our

218
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,840
clinging and attachment

219
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
and that more permanent separation from

220
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,039
attachment

221
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,240
is um is you know called liberation

222
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,440
and so um

223
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,120
so this somali practice is meant to

224
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,080
support that process of liberation

225
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,360
um and so it's not just getting absorbed

226
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,879
and feeling the healthiness

227
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,039
the goodness the wholesomeness the

228
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,720
satisfaction the deep contentment of

229
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,479
just being absorbed in the breathing

230
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,360
flowing with the breath but it's

231
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,959
preparing the mind

232
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,680
so the mind is softer more

233
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,919
workable more able to let go more

234
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,159
more

235
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,920
malleable in a sense so that the ways

236
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,360
it's contracted

237
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,440
has a room to breathe it's a room to let

238
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,760
go and open up

239
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,600
and we start feeling some of the

240
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,880
seclusions

241
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,519
some of these seclusions which partake

242
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,320
of or

243
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,160
or have qualities of liberation in them

244
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,640
for example being temporarily liberated

245
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,720
from the hindrances

246
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,760
and so that brings us to the 12th step

247
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,680
of these 16 steps of breathing

248
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,200
so the 11th one is breathing in

249
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,080
one concentrates the mind one unifies

250
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,200
the mind one

251
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,160
steady is the mind breathing out one

252
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,440
unifies the mind

253
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,640
steadies the mind composes the mind

254
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,880
concentrates the mind whatever that word

255
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
is translated as

256
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,920
the samadhi word and then

257
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,839
the 12th step is one liberates the mind

258
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,600
breathing in one liberates the mind

259
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,160
breathing out when liberates the mind

260
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,680
and and now we're starting to get into

261
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,720
the territory of the real purpose of

262
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,000
buddhist meditation

263
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,880
this area of liberation and we'll pick

264
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,440
up that

265
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,680
continue with that tomorrow and in the

266
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,279
meantime

267
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,200
you might look for how you can lovingly

268
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,079
delightfully be absorbed in what you do

269
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,320
during the day

270
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,279
wash dishes be absorbed and just do that

271
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,360
in a way just turn yourself over fully

272
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,120
to the enjoyment of that without

273
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,760
letting the mind take you away and maybe

274
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,959
there's a lot of activities

275
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,480
throughout the day that you can do if

276
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,320
you eat alone for example

277
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,519
absorbed in just the eating and

278
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,440
learning to kind of appreciate or

279
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,120
develop that capacity

280
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,839
to give ourselves over fully to what

281
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,600
we're doing when we're doing it

282
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
so that there's qualities of absorption

283
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,880
like a good

284
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,120
you know involved in playing music in a

285
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,440
nice way

286
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,640
they supports us to learn how to do that

287
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,000
meditation

288
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,320
so you might want to play around with

289
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,440
that during the day

290
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,440
today next 24 hours

291
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,120
so thank you very much and

292
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,320
and i look forward to our time tomorrow

293
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,440
