00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,880
all right good morning everyone welcome to the third day of our

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,198
meditation this week the series on elements of mindfulness from Vena

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,400
feeling tone yesterday we started with the kind of wanting and not wanting that

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:27,519
can layer on top of Vena if we don't see it clearly acknowledge it

5
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,280
clearly and um today talk about some other attitudes of Mind other healthier

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,559
or more helpful ways to move into

7
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:45,840
dedicated meditation so warm greetings to all of you from Santa

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,559
Cruz and the invitation is to begin to settle into a

9
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,000
meditation posture as I'm doing you can kind of

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,378
balance yourself over your hips align your head with your

11
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:12,799
[Music] spine can be helpful to take a couple of

12
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,119
slower more intentional deeper

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,640
breaths and just check out check out how your posture is how your body

14
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:43,000
is maybe scanning through briefly and noticing where the weight is distributed

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,960
maybe over your hip points buttocks feet if your back is against a chair

16
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,520
really taking that support

17
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,840
in and SC Banning through and noticing the

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,798
aliveness of your body the

19
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,799
vibrancy warmth and cool tingling or

20
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,239
pulsing the motion of your body

21
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,760
breathing

22
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:43,159
then to checking in with your internal

23
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,680
posture are you leaning forwards towards or

24
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,879
away against wanting or not wanting in this

25
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,760
moment or is there a balance

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,879
of internal posture balance of mind and

27
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,200
heart the

28
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,560
encouragement is to be receptive in these moments of meditation

29
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:34,040
together and allow experience to flow through without leaning forward W or backwards it's fine if you do just

30
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:40,200
notice but noticing also moments

31
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,200
of

32
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:53,000
okayness peacefulness

33
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,640
mindfulness and with that encourage enouragement relaxing just a little bit more on the

34
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,280
out breath and then allowing the breathing

35
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,680
to be

36
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
normal

37
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,080
natural tuning in to the felt sense of the

38
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,880
moment the wave like action of in breath and out

39
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,600
breath or the broader field of aliveness of

40
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,520
Sensations or perhaps the coming and going of other sensory

41
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,800
experience like

42
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,880
sound choosing whatever anchor of attention object of attention works for

43
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,680
you and resting

44
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,639
receiving allowing the body heart and

45
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,400
mind to come together in the experience of this

46
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,840
moment

47
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
now

48
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,680
whatever your chosen anchor of attention

49
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:18,120
is dedicating dedicating

50
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,080
yourself to being in contact with

51
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,319
it thinking in

52
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:41,199
interest appreciative interest in each breath each

53
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
moment

54
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,839
if anything unpleasant arises acknowledging

55
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,839
it

56
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,680
simply no need to push away lean away

57
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,800
allowing space around

58
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,399
it if anything Pleasant

59
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:24,680
arises allowing it perhaps savoring it without trying to

60
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,639
hold on to it allow allowing this to to flow

61
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:38,959
through unimpeded balanced in the

62
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
moment

63
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:59,960
I'm time to time checking in on the internal posture the internal

64
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,919
stance during this meditation leaning

65
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,799
towards pulling away or

66
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:15,919
balanced

67
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,960
allowing allowing the flow of

68
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,320
experience to move through

69
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:05,398
and as we begin to come towards the close of this meditation

70
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,799
together the invitation is to

71
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,399
recollect these moments spent in

72
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
cultivation

73
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,960
appreciating steeping in any moments of

74
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:44,380
peacefulness kindness allowing

75
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,459
[Music]

76
00:27:51,880 --> 00:28:00,440
accepting any kind of goodness and from that

77
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:09,760
place being with with loving attention anything that

78
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,919
may have been not so nice not so

79
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:23,320
pleasant allowing that too with kind

80
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:33,559
attention and from that

81
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,279
place of an open heart casting your gaze

82
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:47,720
outwards to the others in your life other beings people

83
00:28:51,760 --> 00:29:00,000
animals and if it feels right setting the determination that this time of

84
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,080
practice your practice in general perhaps your

85
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,880
life benefit

86
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:20,799
them may our practice here together benefit all who our lives

87
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
touch

88
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,089
[Music]

thank you for your

90
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
practice

91

so good morning good day warm greetings

92
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,559
everyone appreciate our time here together

93
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:29,480
meditating and lovely to see little bows in the

94
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:36,760
chat the warm greetings from my fellow Santa crusan Hello nice to see

95
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,840
you and special welcome to those of you who slipped in a little bit late to the

96
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:50,679
zoom room glad you're here so today is the third day on our

97
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:59,080
series of core or essential elements of mindfulness meditation

98
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:05,120
this week so far we've covered Monday feeling tone or Vena that

99
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,480
very simple parsing of experience as pleasant unpleasant or

100
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,240
neither and mindfulness of Vena can undercut all kinds of problematic ways

101
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,519
of spinning out or building houses of cards of thinking and

102
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:29,159
stories and in Buddhist psychology it underpins another simple kind of layer

103
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:34,639
of experience which is wanting or not

104
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:39,880
wanting otherwise known as Veta or not sorry not veta

105
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:47,159
craving and wanting or not wanting can be as simple as a little pulse of

106
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:53,760
wanting or strong as desire strong greed the not wanting can be a simple pulse of

107
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,880
pulling away or a ver all the way up from mild irritation to

108
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,480
hatred hostility the reason this is

109
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,519
important is that between feeling tone and this wanting and not wanting there's

110
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:20,840
a choice we can notice versus start craving wanting not wanting and even

111
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:28,840
when craving has appeared it's possible again to notice it rather than having it

112
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:35,519
run us which it does a lot of the time right if I'm seeing my experience

113
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:42,279
through the lens of greed even my meditation might have cultivation of

114
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:49,240
greed as it's outcome if I'm seeing my experience through the lens of through the filter

115
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:55,720
of aversion I might actually be increasing my aversion my dislike

116
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,200
towards something so yesterday I talked about recognizing

117
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,279
and working with these unhelpful attitudes or proclivities of

118
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:12,079
mind and today we're going to talk about some of the more helpful attitudes or

119
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:19,480
frames of Mind how they can support practice and um touch on ways of recognizing and

120
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:25,320
perhaps cultivating them so that's where we're going for the next little while and there'll probably

121
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:33,919
be time for some Q&A again today so first I want to plug in

122
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,480
um neutral Veta neutral feeling

123
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,878
tone neither Pleasant nor unpleasant so this can be a real source

124
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:53,638
of instruction about frame of mind about this kind of filter we might bring or

125
00:34:53,639 --> 00:35:00,560
attitude the Mind might have when attended to

126
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:08,440
with an aversive frame of mind even a very neutral experience can begin to feel

127
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:16,359
unpleasant you've all probably experienced this for example if I'm doing dishes there's just water running

128
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:22,200
over my hands there's contact with the cloth there's contact with the dish but

129
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:27,520
if I'm resentful and rushed or stressed

130
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,880
then that becomes an unpleasant experience on the other hand if I am

131
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:41,760
washing a dish for a good friend or with a good friend and it's a point of generosity or connection The Experience

132
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,079
can actually be quite Pleasant that generosity that wholesome

133
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:55,800
beneficial attitude of Mind shifts perception of a lot of experience for

134
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:02,560
us one of my parents' neighbors my parents are in their 70s and they're in a snow

135
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,240
town a ski town and one of their somewhat younger neighbors absolutely

136
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,359
loves snowblowing or shoveling his neighbor's driveway he'd far rather do

137
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:19,839
my parents driveway than his driveway you've all felt this right it's

138
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:25,880
that generosity or impulse of friendliness or kindness meta can Infuse

139
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,000
an activity and shift the vant of the feeling tone

140
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,640
of it art students or photographers sometimes notice that the simplest

141
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,000
subject becomes far more interesting the more they study it recognize the details

142
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,760
naturalists notice this too it could be a very simple plant but

143
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:56,280
wow you start noticing all the details of the weaves and the way they interact with the stem and the habit of the way

144
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,400
it grows go it suddenly becomes more interesting

145
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:06,440
and more pleasant the breath and meditation can

146
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:12,640
be like this moving from neutral maybe to unpleasant if we have expectations or

147
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,280
having trick tricky time breathing over to very pleasant if we're

148
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:24,280
on a roll and the attention settles on the breath rests in the

149
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,800
breath so again these differences in breath they can be differences in what's

150
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:36,480
happening but many times it's less about what's happening with the object of our attention and much

151
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,480
more about the frame of mind attitude of mind or other mental

152
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,838
factors such as interest or steadiness of

153
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:57,480
mind so attitude of mind is key balance of mind that clear undistorted form of

154
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:04,079
mindfulness awareness and the attitude or the Mind

155
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:09,960
state that we're having can become the object of our attention a number of

156
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:16,040
people we're calling today St meth's day I love it that today could be meta

157
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:22,280
day meta kindness loving kindness friendliness is another attitude of mind

158
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,400
that in this tradition of Buddhism is often intentionally cultivated

159
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:35,000
and we notice it and it becomes a source of wisdom when we begin to notice its absence versus its presence intention

160
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:42,200
versus the rising so sometimes no matter what you

161
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:50,240
do it seems you can come into a a period of meditation with a very unhelpful

162
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:57,520
attitude irritation wanting sadness um whatever sadness

163
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:03,480
doesn't have to be a problem for example if the mindfulness is brought to the

164
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,880
experience of sadness if it doesn't need to be another way and if we don't

165
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:17,040
necessarily need to believe all the thoughts that spin up from it mindfulness brought

166
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,319
two unpleasant states of mind is a completely different experience than

167
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:30,560
mindfulness experienced through them mindfulness brought to wanting or not

168
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:37,800
wanting greed or aversion transforms them it transforms

169
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:43,680
them so here are some ways that can be

170
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:50,800
possible to shift from an unhelpful attitude otherwise known as frame of

171
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:59,280
mind to a helpful one not notice the simple knowing itself

172
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,680
the mindfulness itself sometimes this is enough knowing

173
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:14,400
that you're mindful being aware that you're aware to begin to Simply Be with whatever's

174
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,720
arising it can if that doesn't seem accessible to you for some people it feels quite easy for other people it

175
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:27,960
feels impossible then simply noticing the absence of problem s by the way

176
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,839
folks I cannot read questions while I'm talking so if you hold your questions till the end of the talking the chances

177
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:40,359
of um me answering them are much higher because they will disappear up the chat

178
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:47,000
box and I won't be able to find them again so hold them or copy them and paste them at the end okay I can see

179
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,160
them but I can't talk and respond simultaneously

180
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,280
here so noticing the absence of problems tiat Hong called this noticing the

181
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:06,119
absence of a toothache second take a step

182
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:11,800
back take a step back if a difficulty feels charged

183
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,880
notice the charge and if possible

184
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:25,920
bring kindness compassion patience to it so body pain knee pain you can notice

185
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,560
the pain pain with aversion and that will make the pain worse if you notice the

186
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:38,640
aversion with aversion that will make the aversion worse if instead you notice the aversion

187
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,960
with kindness things can start to

188
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:53,680
transform finally trust the process trust the process confidence or trust in

189
00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:01,359
the process is so helpful it can be a key condition for emerging

190
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:08,680
from Duca from suffering into Joy or into other beautiful states of mind if

191
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:14,839
there is trust so awareness awareness of what is

192
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:20,280
happening is key and attitude towards what's

193
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,800
happening can shift experience no matter what level of experience you're talking

194
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,359
about the simple contact with

195
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:40,240
experience the attribution or parsing of Vena or feeling tone can be shifted by

196
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,280
attitude and even an unhelpful

197
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:52,880
attitude despair anger Etc can be shifted Again by kindness patience trust

198
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,599
in the process so that was a lot but just to

199
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:04,680
name that Discerning what conditions what attitudes are helpful for your

200
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:11,160
practice is a learning process and it's helpful to keep in mind

201
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:16,280
that it benefits from acceptance or acknowledgement of what's Happening

202
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,400
rather than contention a sense of allowing or open

203
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:27,480
interest kind regard so

204
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:36,119
all of the things I just named are beautifully balanced attitudes to bring to meditation and to these craving based

205
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:42,480
attitudes that you may notice frames of mind and attitude are the same here that

206
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:50,359
you may notice and for the purpose of mindfulness meditation any object of attention is

207
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:57,640
valid so get interested can be fuel fuel for wisdom discern discernment and

208
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,838
Awakening thank

209
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:10,559
you so friends we have spent another 45 minutes together

210
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:16,559
and I just want to dedicate our time

211
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:23,319
together for the benefit of all beings thank you for your attention and I will stay back for another 3 or 4 minutes to

212
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:30,000
answer questions for those of you who put them in if you want to put them in again I'll do my

213
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,640
best thank you for your

214
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,720
practice oh Charles Le is it possible to have wrapped interest in neutral V or

215
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:51,319
neither Pleasant nor unpleasant Veta without the experience becoming Pleasant or

216
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:59,160
unpleasant I would say check that out for yourself in my own experience wrapped interest actually is a synonym

217
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:04,440
for p which is a synonym for Joy or pleasure so I would say it's possible to

218
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:10,480
be very immersed in an experience and have it be neither but probably not have wrapped

219
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,880
interest again check it out in your own

220
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,880
experience

221
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,440
who in so as I mentioned a couple of times after glimpsing this um in the

222
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:59,319
chat your question how does frame of mind relate to Vena I was using the term frame of mind synonymous with attitude

223
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:06,520
or craving in this craving potentially or um wholesome states of mind so if you

224
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:11,559
think of it as a layer cake contact with sensation or contact

225
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:16,920
with an arising Veta or feeling tone is the simplest parsing of pleasant

226
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:26,240
unpleasant or neutral and attitude of mind frame of mind is the response to those two things

227
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:33,680
sometimes it can be if we're very mindful the response to Bear sense experience or more

228
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:40,319
frequently attitude of mind is more of just the gal frame of mind is a gal an

229
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:47,079
attitude towards the pleasant unpleasant or neutral or attitude towards

230
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:54,800
attitude so they do interplay with each other but usually vona is more

231
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,520
fundamental Leila that's a great question the relationship between equinity and

232
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:09,680
neither or neutral V so equinity again is most often a mind

233
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:16,559
state or attitude of mind so we can have extraordinary experiences of pleasant or

234
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:25,760
unpleasant and still be equanimous about them and there's a form of equinity in

235
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,200
embodied equinity in which all experience can in

236
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,880
deeper states of meditation be experienced as neither Pleasant nor

237
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:44,920
unpleasant so I hope that's helpful and I'm just reading

238
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:55,319
here yes good observation lorine a shift bringing mindfulness to worry from blame

239
00:47:55,319 --> 00:48:02,119
and hust hostility exactly exactly it walks it down to a

240
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:07,800
simpler level of experience and that is part of what this practice can teach us

241
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:13,400
as ways to Simply Be with our experience without

242
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:20,280
needing to project outwards and to blame or hostility so thank you very much

243
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:27,040
everyone for your kind attention for your questions and most of all for your practice and your

244
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:33,400
sincerity and we will be back tomorrow so hope to see you

245
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,520
then
