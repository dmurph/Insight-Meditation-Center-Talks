and we get to practice together how sweet how special how special

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,040
so so for the theme for uh today's practice

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,800
um yeah i wanted to um

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:50,399
invite us to consider the juxtaposition of

8
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,199
the times which is what's happening with the new varian the omicron variant and

9
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,039
the world being on edge and again seems like we're heading into

10
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,320
another period of challenge in the world so and we are we've already been in the

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,560
midst of a challenging period and it's about to get even more challenging so not to turn away from that not to turn

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,479
away from that and also to acknowledge that meta

13
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:27,360
loving kindness good will for ourselves and others is a resource in tough times is a

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,880
resource is a refuge is there refuge that soothes and calms the heart and

15
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,400
mind for ourselves and for others so that we can be more

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:48,479
available for ourselves and for others so it's at both end it's a both end

17
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,520
so that's the theme [Music] like the consideration i'd like to bring in for

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,799
for our practice this evening not to turn away from the challenges in the world

19
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,119
and yet knowing that trusting that our practice of mental good will for ourselves and

20
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,319
for others is is refreshing is is renewing is a

21
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,560
refuge really it's it's it's a our hearts refuge and we can offer that

22
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:26,879
stability that care that warmth both to ourselves and to everyone else in the world even

23
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:34,239
if we may not we many people we might have contact with and speak with and they might be ah

24
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,400
very upset and in challenging times um experiencing challenges and for us to

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,959

practice as a gift to others when you share your insights or challenges

190
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:18,680
as you well know by now it supports others

191
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,680
mima please

192
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:53,119
thank you um i thought it was so appropriate tonight with this meditation because

193
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,880
you see what's going on in the world and sometimes

194
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:06,000
hearing people speak you know i know i hurt for them

195
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,560
and i felt reminded of mehta being the antidote to suffering

196
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:19,040
and uh that's kind of what i was floating and bathing in

197
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,200
um as an antidote to what we see going on in the world right now so i thought it was

198
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:32,400
a very appropriate thing for tonight thank you thank you mima yeah

199
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:39,040
and with so much suffering you know meta trans gets transformed into compassion

200
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,240
compassion holds compassion can hold the suffering it

201
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,760
just it's uh it becomes um it's

202
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,440
as you're using the word antidote it's yes that it's the medicine maybe that's

203
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:02,800
what i would use it's the medicine yeah the medicine it doesn't negate it but it just it's the medicine it's the self

204
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:11,319
beautiful thank you mima yeah ah i appreciate your reflections

244
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:36,640
jerry please the comment uh filming on what's been said but the word

245
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:44,400
that struck me was the lullaby of the breath that when you said that uh

246
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,680
uh combined with letting go of various

247
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,880
perhaps what ifs and butts clubs uh you might call it um

248
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,640
it particularly struck me the lullaby of the breath which i hadn't sort of thought about

249
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,760
and i was just like oh it's like a chiropractic moment just like oh i can

250
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,280
let go of this stuff and so it speaks to what everyone else was i

251
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,480
thought wow this is a powerful thought a lullaby of a breath so

252
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,440
that's about to say thank you jerry thanks for reflecting that back and highlighting that the

253
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,920
lullaby of the breath yeah you caught that yes and others too

254
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,960
it feels like that right it can feel when you tune into it there's just

255
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,079
lullaby quality the soothing calming

256
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,440
