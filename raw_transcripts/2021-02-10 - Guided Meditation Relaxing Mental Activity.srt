1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,919
so warm greetings everyone and

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,600
so certainly i'm happy to be here with you all and spend this time in the practice and in

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,720
the dharma and there is a

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,760
kind of a loose principle that

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,320
agitated thoughts attract more agitated thoughts

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,239
and that tranquil thoughts attract attract more tranquil thoughts

7
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:52,879
and one of the ways of understanding this is that um that i understand it is that

8
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,239
just in the ordinary activities of daily life if we're a little bit busy doing things

9
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,520
and maybe a little bit busy and maybe feeling a little pressure about what we're doing

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,560
it's easy to do those things with a little bit of agitation or a little bit of pressure or tension as we do them

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,640
and that pressure tension agitation is kind of a magnet or an encouragement

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,080
or a catalyst for more agitated thoughts maybe on unrelated topics it's like it

13
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,560
predisposes us to be agitated tense anxious

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,600
and and this is one of the reasons why sitting down to meditate

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,159
can sometimes feel like such a relief because we're no longer having to do anything no

16
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:49,439
longer having to take care of the daily affairs of life or work or responsibilities or for these few

17
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,280
minutes all that can stop and and the relief of that stopping then

18
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,360
becomes a little bit of a magnet or a catalyst to begin uh shifting how

19
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,920
our thinking is so thinking becomes quieter becomes more tranquil and and

20
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:16,319
tranquility attracts more tranquility so perhaps for some of you you will feel

21
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:26,080
that relief of being able to sit here and and not have to be doing and making and accomplishing and

22
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,000
just just to be here in a very simple way and all this practice and instructions

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,440
kind of on upon asati can lend itself to the idea that there's a lot to do

24
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,560
and if we sit down with this kind of this agitated energy or this pressure energy

25
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,760
that can be carried over into how we do this practice but uh it's i think it's best to start

26
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,519
with a reminder that you don't have to do much

27
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,959
and in in a big way meditation is an undoing it's allowing ourselves to

28
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:10,159
not be so busy and doing a lot and accomplishing a lot and starting off with a contentment and

29
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:16,239
just a relief of just being here where just being alive is enough

30
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:24,319
just breathing attentively without any other activity is maybe enough

31
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:32,239
and then on that foundation then the practice builds and i say that carefully the practice

32
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:39,920
builds rather than we build on that there's something about allowing something to evolve and develop

33
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:49,360
that's very important for this practice so assuming a meditation posture

34
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,079
and it's often good to have a posture that feels stable

35
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,439
because in that stability we can maybe shed

36
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:08,239
the busyness of life shed the agitation and concerns

37
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:15,360
and needs to do kind of like water just rolls down the

38
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,120
sides of a mountain so the agitations and concerns begin

39
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:29,840
just kind of rolling down off us

40
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:42,479
closing the eyes and

41
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:48,320
gently maybe slowly maybe not too much

42
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,080
taking some fuller a few fuller breaths

43
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,660
just so it's comfortable and nice to really take in more air

44
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,160
[Music] expand the rib cage

45
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,840
feel the body this more solidly more the substance of the

46
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,280
body in the movements of the body breathing more deeply

47
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,840
more fully

48
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:35,120
and perhaps letting the exhale last a little bit longer

49
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,840
longer than the inhale

50
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,440
to do something that's a little different that might get your mind's attention on the breath

51
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,320
you can exhale through a slightly open mouth

52
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:04,840
breathing in through the nose fully and then exhale gently slowly

53
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,600
prolonged breathing out the mouth

54
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,919
breathing out of the mouth and silently in your mind saying ah

55
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:35,840
and allowing the tensions of the shoulders to drain off you

56
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,120
taking a rest from the holding of the belly

57
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,039
maybe softening the arms especially the elbows

58
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:03,680
you might flap the elbows a teeny bit to make sure that they're loose

59
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:17,840
maybe releasing any tension in the hands

60
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,039
and then letting your breathing return to normal

61
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:31,840
breathing maybe through your nose in and out

62
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:49,039
and bringing your attention to that part of your body where you most associate to thinking

63
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:56,560
where there might be some tension or pressure tightness associated with thinking

64
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,479
agitation someplace where it's energized

65
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,800
and as you exhale see if you can relax

66
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,440
soften

67
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
open

68
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:42,320
as you exhale releasing the hold on your thoughts

69
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,519
and resting in the space of the mind

70
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,760
that's wider bigger

71
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,720
then your thoughts and images that you have

72
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,880
maybe you can notice some quality of the mind

73
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:20,319
that has the ability to be receptive tranquil

74
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,959
calm even when you're agitated

75
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,160
maybe it's below the agitation or behind it

76
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,680
or in the cracks between it see if you can become attuned

77
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,800
to some quality of mental calm tranquility

78
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,839
peacefulness

79
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,320
and then as you exhale relaxing the mental activity

80
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:19,839
so it relaxes into dissolves into the calm

81
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,640
and then with a very relaxed way with very little energy expended

82
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:47,839
receive an awareness the experience of the body breathing

83
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:15,839
so that there's a very light touch between the body breathing and awareness

84
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:27,279
inviting the experience of breathing into whatever calm or tranquility that

85
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:43,839
might be here even if you're agitated in other ways

86
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:55,120
and for a few minutes if you can don't worry about anything

87
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:03,120
just trust entrust yourself to your breathing without measuring it

88
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,959
or needing it to be different or judging yourself for it

89
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:16,160
a very simple dedication trusting all you need to do

90
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,600
is to accompany your breathing

91
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:30,320
for a few minutes here with any without any concern with the quality of your attention or

92
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:39,839
just a dedication to breathing

93
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:58,959
and when you find yourself drifting off in thought rather than letting go of your thinking

94
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:07,519
see if what look around and see what you can relax that's associated with thinking

95
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,920
see what needs to be settled reassured

96
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,839
let the mind return to a little bit more calmness

97
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:36,880
in doing so you might find that your the strength of your thinking

98
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
decreases

99
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,640
the more settled we become in meditation

100
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:57,840
the more heightened awareness we have sensitivity to the mind thinking

101
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:08,840
noticing it sooner noticing the unsatisfactory

102
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:15,120
this of being involved caught up in thoughts

103
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,320
noticing the relief of not thinking so much

104
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:31,840
when you find yourself thinking see if you can feel or experience

105
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:39,840
the impact thinking has on your body your mind

106
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:48,480
and then relax the tension the agitation

107
00:19:48,880 --> 00:20:07,840
soften the thinking mind quiet

108
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:15,840
whatever mental activity that your can be sensitive to that you can feel

109
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:24,400
see if you can relax it calming the mind

110
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:31,360
maybe as if the breathing washing a calming wave

111
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,519
through your whole body that includes the mind

112
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,520
and the mind softens opens expands

113
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:51,200
beyond its concerns there's so much more

114
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,760
to relax into in the particular concerns and thoughts

115
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,400
that we have

116
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:25,840
waves of calmness breathing through the mind

117
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
so

118
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,240
and then coming to the end of the

119
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:51,440
sitting the mind has greater intelligence

120
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:58,240
the mind has greater creativity when there's not so much energy poured

121
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,039
into thinking

122
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:12,159
the less agitation the less force in the thinking mind

123
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:20,240
the more ease there is and the more space there is for

124
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:29,519
an intelligent wise contact consideration

125
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,559
of others

126
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,840
and to turn your attention now

127
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,840
to other people

128
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,520
families friends neighbors

129
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:05,039
people in your county your state your country your province

130
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:13,360
people that you encounter in through the news or other ways

131
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:21,360
and begin by just relaxing around thinking about them quiet

132
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:29,278
soft mind soft heart

133
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:39,440
and without putting too much effort into it can you evoke a simple

134
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,799
tender kindness good will

135
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:51,840
friendliness for these other people

136
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,279
kindness begets more kindness

137
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,200
love attracts more love to itself

138
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,480
all within our own hearts

139
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:18,000
and then to see if there's an aspiration a wish

140
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,240
for the welfare of these people may they be well and safe

141
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:32,159
may they be happy

142
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,840
and to imagine yourself in their presence

143
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:45,600
with some dedication and championing

144
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:53,120
of their happiness and well-being as their advocate for happiness

145
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:01,279
may all beings be happy

146
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,840
may all beings be safe

147
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:15,840
may all beings be peaceful

148
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:29,840
may all beings everywhere be free

149
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,278
you
