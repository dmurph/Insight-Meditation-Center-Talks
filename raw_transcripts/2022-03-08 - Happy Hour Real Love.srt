1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,520
so hello hello nice to be with you

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,760
come to practice together so

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:19,760
so like to um i'd like to share something from

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,119
take not han book tonight um and

5
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,880
he has so many wonderful beautiful

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,040
um books and one of my favorite ones is peace is every step and

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,079
all these short vignettes and i randomly opened a book to a page and

8
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:52,719
it opened to a passage that i love and i thought oh okay i like to share this tonight with the sangha so so here we go

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:01:00,559
so from take nothing this is uh this section is called real

10
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,240
love and for those of you who may have the book and later want to look this up it's on page

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,560
80. so take note han says about real love

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,560
let it wash over you can close your eyes i'll read it slowly

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,159
we really have to understand the person we want to love

14
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:32,000
if our love is only a will to possess it is not real love

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,360
if we only think of ourselves if we know only

16
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,360
our own needs and ignore the needs of the other person

17
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,600
we cannot love we must look deeply in order to see and

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,119
understand the needs aspirations and suffering

19
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,920
of the person we love i love that needs aspirations and suffering

20
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,479
of the person we love this is the ground of real love

21
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,120
you cannot resist loving another person when you really understand them

22
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,640
i'll read the other couple of paragraphs and please think about

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:28,000
this love that he talks about not only as romantic love of course not it's

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,760
love of any kind love of any kind even

25
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:43,680
when we have friends colleagues a sense of love and care only if we think of our own needs so so or people elsewhere so

26
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,080
think of it as an expansive vision of love he continues

27
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,680
next section is more about people we know but again we can take this principle and make it

28
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,720
general so next section from time to time sit close to the one

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,680
you love hold their hand and ask darling do i understand you enough or am i making you

30
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,400
suffer please tell me so that i can learn to love you properly i don't want to make you suffer

31
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:22,159
and if i do so because of my ignorance please tell me so that i can love you better so that you can be happy

32
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,280
if you say this in the voice that communicates your real openness and understanding

33
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,360
the other person may cry that is a good sign because it means the door of understanding

34
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,440
is opening and everything will be possible maybe a father does not have time or is

35
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,799
not brave enough to ask his son such a question then the love between them will not be

36
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,920
as full as it could be we need courage to ask these questions

37
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,239
but if we don't ask the more we love the more we may destroy the people we are

38
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,280
trying to love this is so profound

39
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,400
if we don't ask the more we love the more we may destroy the people we are

40
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,519
trying to love true love needs understanding with understanding the one we love will

41
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,620
certainly flower what a beautiful teaching

42
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:25,120
[Music] so so both in terms of

43
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,479
close relationships when

44
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,400
there's someone near and dear to us could be a friend in this case a child

45
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,680
or a relative or even friends colleagues

46
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:50,720
and the idea also i want to bring in here is that we can love people without even liking

47
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,280
them it is possible to not necessarily like someone but to

48
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,199
love them and in this way to care for

49
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,280
or understand appreciate how take the perspective of their needs

50
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,800
their suffering their aspirations their wants

51
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,320
so as we've practiced together in the sapi hour in the past with

52
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,520
um say with the neutral being with the person we don't know where very well and

53
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,759
we bring this sense of common humanity or just like me taking their perspective

54
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,560
just like me as a human being who wants to be happy so this idea of real love

55
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,880
can be both in terms of people that are near and dear to us people we care

56
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,120
about in our lives friends and if we try to possess if we try to just take their

57
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,080
time try to take their resources that's not real love it's real love is

58
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:06,560
not just about me me me my needs my needs what can you give me dear friend dear teacher dear i don't

59
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,199
know whatever me me me me me so so a sense of

60
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,880
um especially in close role or children like

61
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,759
to saturn my need to be loved uh what is what do they need what what is their

62
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,440
need and as as tikhnathan puts [Music]

63
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,360
we must look deeply in order to see and understand the needs aspirations

64
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,080
and suffering the people we love this is the ground of real love

65
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,479
one last thing to say it is said that understanding

66
00:06:52,639 --> 00:07:00,080
really understanding someone else clear understanding is equivalent to loving them when we

67
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,639
understand someone when we really understand that the heart can open

68
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,919
from this perspective of self-centeredness just being centered on

69
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,840
our own needs to having a wider perspective a bigger perspective it's

70
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,759
not just about me then service actually love can become an

71
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:31,039
act of service so i think i have said enough for

72
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,880
setting the frame for our reflection for our meditation today so i'd like to

73
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,800
invite us all ah to land to arrive

74
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,919
in your body in your posture if you need to move

75
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:54,639
to sit your cushion or lie down this is the time

76
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:01,280
entering a posture that's going to be comfortable for the next 30 minutes or so

77
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,280
and landing arriving in this body here

78
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,360
here

79
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,599
connecting understanding

80
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,000
opening up to the sensations in this body in this moment

81
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:43,680
not try to control but to open up to ah to relax into

82
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,760
can we have real love for ourselves for this body

83
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,680
even if there are pain there is pain there are challenges

84
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:03,760
now try to conquer but to open up to things as they are

85
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,839
this breath this sensation

86
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,279
with openheartedness

87
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,959
as always let us arrive let us settle first

88
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,279
with the breath

89
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,880
as it moves through the body the sensations

90
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,000
wherever they show up

91
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:13,440
expanding touching knowing every cell of this body

92
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,720
as if greeting breath greeting internally

93
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:28,839
gently kissing each cell inviting you to relax

94
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,240
to be just as it is

95
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,720
awareness awareness aware awareness knowing

96
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,320
the breath the sensations just this

97
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:58,720
releasing thoughts plans just being here relishing

98
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,399
this moment

99
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,880
and i'd like to invite you maybe first turning turning to ourselves

100
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:17,839
turning to this being it was me as if it were a beloved other

101
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,839
yes take not han recommends in this passage real love

102
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,279
asking ourselves these loving questions first

103
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:40,000
asking yourself sweetheart sweetheart darling

104
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:49,680

105
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,040
please tell me so please tell me so that i can

106
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:05,199
learn to love you properly i don't want to make you suffer

107
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:13,839
and if i do so because of my ignorance please tell me

108
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:21,040
so that i can love you better can we ask ourselves this question see

109
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,839
what arises don't think about it drop it in drop the question in

110
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,800
into your body

111
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,120
as if a pebble dropped into a pond

112
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,519
resonating the water resonating reverberating

113
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:54,839
how can i love you better sweetheart darling

114
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,279
maybe the answer is wordless maybe just asking this question is enough

115
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,720
or something to be unleashed opened up internally

116
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:38,640
like to experiment with putting palm in your heart center your chest connect with yourself

117
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,960
physically more fully your own heart darling sweetheart how can i love you

118
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:52,960
better am i making you suffer

119
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,000
help me see help me now

120
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,720
how can i love you better

121
00:18:53,039 --> 00:19:00,320
and this is not a chance to self-recriminate or self-judge just

122
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,200
meeting yourself with love with understanding in fact it's a time

123
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:15,519
not to do any self-judgment or self-criticism if any of that is coming up

124
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,360
let's drop it

125
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,240
not needed release

126
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,640
not a time for self-judgment or shame just loving

127
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,760
caring as best as we're able to

128
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:38,880
and now i'd like to invite you to bring to my your mind's eye if you wish you want to stay

129
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:47,600
with yourself if it's been a hard day and lovingly stay with yourself that's fine

130
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,280
and if it feels appropriate to move on that's okay also see what your heart

131
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,280
needs right now what is the ultimate expression of care

132
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:08,080
if you like you cannot bring to your mind your mind's eye someone who's near and dear to you

133
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:16,880
someone you love care for their well-being

134
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,039
so with with whom you have an easy relationship perhaps

135
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:43,039
wondering and in your heart your mind asking how can i understand you better

136
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:51,440
dear my dear what are what are your needs

137
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,960
your aspirations [Music] your hopes the ways you suffer

138
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,799
how can i understand you how can i understand you

139
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:11,279
better not to possess

140
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,559
not to satisfy my own needs but to understand you

141
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:23,840
to step out of my limited perspective what i me me i want

142
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,159
to see you from your complicated complex beautiful

143
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,159
perspective of the uniqueness of you as if i were gazing through the world

144
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,480
through your eyes as much as possible

145
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,480
how can i love you better through understanding you

146
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,960
see for a moment as if you were stepping

147
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:07,520
behind your eyes looking at the world what does it feel like what do you see

148
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,960
how can you love them better

149
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,120
for their sake not your sake

150
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,320
their needs and wants

151
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,880
in this way love can be service love as service

152
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,559
serving their growth serving their goodness their beauty

153
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,360
how can i serve you better how can i love you better

154
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:55,360
and you can stay with yourself if you like as a beloved other

155
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,960
or a spare being

156
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:09,200
a dear being in your life you want to try a bit of a stretch

157
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,200
maybe bringing someone to mind that's different from you

158
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:22,159
many ways different maybe you've had some minor challenge with please don't choose the hardest

159
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:28,080
most challenging person for you just

160
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:34,080
tread lightly someone maybe who's been complicated a

161
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,278
little bit in the past

162
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:48,639
just a tiny tiny bit challenging does the touch challenge

163
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:57,039
where there isn't much energy and if no one comes up then go back to your dear person or yourself

164
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:05,919
and can you see this person this being

165
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,840
from their perspective their hopes and dreams their aspirations

166
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,840
the way they suffer they suffer as if you're looking into the world

167
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,440
through their eyes and trying to understand them you could

168
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:30,320
have been born as them they could have been born as you this is so random

169
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:39,200
the bodies the circumstances the parents were born into the family

170
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:46,559
background upbringing what if you were then

171
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:02,159
even if you they're areas of their personality you don't like or you disagree can you love them

172
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:09,640
meaning can you understand them better just a little better

173
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:28,480
doesn't need to agree with everything there's just can you understand them just a tiny

174
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:36,039
bit more from this perspective

175
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:12,560
and we offer our love to the world

176
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,380
stepping outside of ourselves from ourselves as a beloved other too

177
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,488
[Music]

178
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,720

179
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,920

180

198
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:30,560
what came up especially if you haven't spoken for a while offering your insights or

199
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,960
your questions or your confusion as as an offering to serve both

200
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:44,560
yourself being held being witnessed and for the benefit of others if they're aha moments

201
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:51,440
you can type them in chat if you like if you type them to the group

202
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,680
then i will read the reflections if you type them to me alone

203
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,520
it will be private you can also raise your hand and if you cannot hear me you can type

204
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:10,000
it but i think my my image is frozen but i think audio is still working so i hope it's still good

205
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,359

deep gosha thank you you're welcome thank you for your practice

208
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,359
see private question coming i have quit meditating for

209
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:10,400
many months now the reason being every time i sit to meditate

210
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,560
my mind wanders and i become enraged with hatred for people who have done wrong to me

211
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:24,079
although they are not in my life anymore so instead i chose to concentrate on hobbies hobbies

212
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:30,160
that require concentration like learning to play an instrument and learning a new language

213
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:37,040
how can i get engaged in regular meditation again thank you thank you so much for that

214
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,319
question yeah beautiful question um

215
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:48,480
and very apt the invitation the recommendation i have for you

216
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:55,480
is first and foremost as you engage with practice to practice

217
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:02,800
self-compassion compassion and love and care for yourself because you are the one who is suffering

218
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,640
anger when we're angry we feel like oh yeah we're angry at others but it's like

219
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:16,000
picking up a hot coal that you're trying to throw at someone but who gets hurt when you

220
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,119
pick up a hot coal well you get hurt first of course so

221
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:28,160
feeling holding yourself with compassion when the mind goes to they they they just bring it back a sweetheart

222
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,920
sweetheart they're gone off they're living their life they don't even know i'm hurting right now just hurting

223
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,760
yourself as if you're holding a young child a younger version of yourself just

224
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,200
holding this young child letting it have a tantrum letting it cry letting it be

225
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,599
angry just hold it sweetheart it's okay you're safe you're safe you're safe it's

226
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,880
okay just holding the child

227
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,160
as long as it's needed for it to be angry with love with love

228
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:09,040
not thinking about others others but just yourself so that's a way that's a way

229
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:16,240
to to re-engage that's my invitation and you're welcome please come back and

231
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,800

233
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:40,960
with love maternal love just stay stay it's going to take a lot of courage which is great

234
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,000

235
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,920

238
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,160
go away see your hand is up please

239
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,760
uh yes um well uh

240
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,520
the only near and dear self that i have is myself

241
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:28,160
and um it's been a difficult number of days and so it was

242
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:34,800
a big question to ask myself how can i better understand

243
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,520
myself because

244
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:48,000
i don't have to look very far to find a very complicated person as myself and um

245
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:56,960
i don't find it easy um at all i i i can i can accept

246
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,160
myself uh even when i'm full of resistance

247
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,359
but that's about all i can do is just is just accept

248
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:14,480
accept my resistance and i don't know why i'm maybe feeling so much resistance

249
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,599
yeah yeah that's the best i can do is to accept

250
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:25,280
that and um just figure that i i may be the best thing i can do is be

251
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,839
patient yes there is so much wisdom ko in what you just shared i want to

252
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:36,079
applaud your inner wisdom that is beautiful that is

253
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,680
pure wisdom acceptance you may not understand it that's okay but can you

254
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:48,160
understand the resistance oh dear sweetheart there's a resistance here okay i can't be with that i don't

255
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:55,040
understand it and i don't need to probe was it my childhood my mother does it's okay i can just be patient and

256
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,800
hold it with kindness there is so much wisdom in that to allow it to

257
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:06,319
to be and unwind and show you the answers because when we let our

258
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:12,720
confusion our resistance our anger feel safe when we offer safety to these

259
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:18,720
complicated emotions without needing to necessarily understand them so yes let's back up from that word understanding i

260
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:26,400
appreciate that he's using it here let's back up from that understanding of that word and yeah using this acceptance

261
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,319
allowing um that that is deep wisdom thanks so much for bringing that in co

262
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:38,000
appreciate it a couple of other reflections here and

263
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,480
before we go quickly into groups

264
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,400
yeah another reflection wonderful loving practice seek first to understand before

265
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,599
being understood quote from stephen covey another reflection thank you nikki

266
00:46:53,599 --> 00:47:00,000
the invitation to ask myself what i need how i can love and support this being was timely and moving thank

267
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,800
you and dave says compassion and meta for the russians were suffering absolutely

268
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:13,520
yes absolutely yes so many beings we all suffer in so many

269
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:21,040
different ways especially people in thai areas of of war right now in this world

270
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,319
love as service you for bringing them in and the last

271
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:31,599
week i offered every session compassion and meta

272
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:38,400
bringing in the people in ukraine especially and and now bringing in russia

273
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,520
and tonight we're staying a little more personal but of course it's

274
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:51,040
practicing love as service is not a selfish aspect serving all beings

275
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,079
so i'd like to invite us now to turn to engaging

276
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:02,160
in small groups together and can we can we hold

277
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:08,559
patiently each other and just listen or share as little or as much as you need to let's

278
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:14,800
start with maybe 10 15 seconds of silent meta for one another and then share as

279
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:22,000
little as you like or maybe just hold with for one another maybe that's a way of

280
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:29,119
listening and holding an understanding or maybe sharing what you're feeling is about real love this understanding as as love

281
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:34,319
love as service so so the rooms are created i'm opening
