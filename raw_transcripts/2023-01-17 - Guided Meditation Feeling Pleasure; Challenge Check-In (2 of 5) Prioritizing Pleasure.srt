1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:12,559
hello everyone and thank you for being here

2
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:19,500
there's a kind of pleasure in sitting down here

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,119
weekday mornings and

4
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:33,960
being together with all of you to meditate for me to be able to do some sharing some of the what I know or

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,420
but practice and maybe some of you there's also a

6
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,180
pleasure some of you uh clearly find some pleasure in all this

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,600
and the chats that you're warmly greetings and the chats you're giving

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,420
and there might be lots of things that are uncomfortable in your life there might be lots of things which are

9
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,840
quite difficult and challenging and things that will lead the mind to

10
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,280
ruminate about them and and have difficult thoughts and

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,280
predictions and ideas about it all

12
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:22,280
and at any given time there is both what is pleasant and what is unpleasant

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,799
and one of the revolutionary ideas that the Buddha had for his time

14
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:37,500
and maybe for some of us it's a revolutionary idea is to allow ourselves to feel more

15
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,960
pleasure to

16
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,380
and especially that's useful when we discover that a lot of the

17
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,500
uncomfortable feelings we have the unpleasantness we experience

18
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,659
has this Genesis or has its support in The Chronic ways in which we're

19
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:07,979
thinking or The Chronic kind of negativity bias where we kind of through fear or through

20
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:15,080
whatever reason we tend to orient ourselves around what is unpleasant

21
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:24,440
and of course Buddhism is about an honest assessment of what's difficult and challenging our suffering

22
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:33,140
not we're not denying that but if we really want to be able to

23
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:40,819
manage in a healthy dharmic way with the sufferings and challenges of our life

24
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,340
the Buddha said it's helpful or it to paraphrase him he's it's helpful to feel

25
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,099
pleasure you're allowed to feel pleasure

26
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,920
there's a role for pleasure in this practice

27
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:07,640
I just went to heat up my water

28
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:13,560
and I noticed that as I was getting ready to heat up the water the way I was handling the

29
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,860
the cup and the filling of water and I put it in the microwave here

30
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:24,959
that I was concerned with the talk I was going to give and teach and the

31
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,260
activities of getting everything ready on time and it was fine but if I really noticed that

32
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,319
carefully I noticed there was some unpleasantness and it wasn't particularly

33
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,480
Pleasant it was and as soon as I recognized that

34
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,200
I became attuned to the pleasure that was there and the PLA and the in

35
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,200
filling up the cup of water carrying it stretching my arm putting it into the microwave

36
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,459
as small maybe insignificant pleasure for in some scale of things

37
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:09,420
and some of that once I felt a pleasure then I could move my arm and be with the

38
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:17,299
whole phenomena heating up the water I could do it in an even more graceful way more pleasant way

39
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,800
was that a denial of the unpleasantness that I was feeling

40
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,500
I don't think so I think that my mind was just focused on one part of reality

41
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,600
and there was a different part of reality that was more nourishing more supportive

42
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:44,040
rather than thinking about what I was going to teach you all of you probably better to show up in a good

43
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,080
state show up

44
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,759
you know who are settled the more happy more contented

45
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:04,020
so as we sit today Orient yourselves towards what is

46
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,660
Pleasant Here and Now not what's Pleasant in your life more generally

47
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,300
but here in your body

48
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:21,780
and not having pleasant thoughts you know things that they're you know

49
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:29,000
Wonderful fantasies but if you are going to think about your meditation

50
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,360
can you think in a pleasant way can you focus your attention in a

51
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,680
pleasant way can you be aware in a way that's not

52
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,479
tense or unpleasant

53
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,880
can the breathing be pleasant

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,020
so to begin the meditation just

55
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,160
sitting up straight

56
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,280
gently closing the eyes

57
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:24,240
and to so be sure to acknowledge and not deny that there are things which

58
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,460
are uncomfortable take a few moments to acknowledge here

59
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,979
and now in your body your heart your mind

60
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:42,620
yes there is a something which is unpleasant uncomfortable

61
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:58,940
and some of that might be unnecessary some of it is a healthy part of life

62
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:08,300
but for practice either way we don't have to push it away or deny it

63
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:18,259
try to fix it and having acknowledged it now

64
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:23,940
if you can acknowledge what is Pleasant for you here and now starting with your

65
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:31,819
body maybe in your hands

66
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,638
wherever it might be the pleasantness

67
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:53,780
maybe there's pleasure in relaxing more softening the tight muscles

68
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:21,020
and then becoming aware of your breathing

69
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,959
and can you be aware of your breathing in a pleasant way

70
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:41,539
or at least not to be aware of it unpleasantly with strain or pushing contraction

71
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,080
with beliefs I can't this is difficult

72
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:57,860
is there something in the most simple way in which your body breathes

73
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:19,100
simple way your body breathes that you can find some pleasure in it

74
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,540
feeling the body's experience of breathing

75
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:55,100
is there any point in the cycle of breathing in and breathing out

76
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,279
that has the most pleasure most nice feeling

77
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,899
however fleeting it is

78
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,640
be sure to feel that part of the cycle well whenever you get to it feel the

79
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,300
pleasure or the niceness

80
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,279
don't don't have to look for dramatic pleasure

81
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,640
maybe it's a very light pleasantness

82
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,339
ease

83
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,800
and as you're experiencing your breathing

84
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,200
maybe in a ease full of relaxed way

85
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:45,920
are there small ways you can adjust your breathing so it becomes more pleasant

86
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,860
maybe there's a relaxing in the belly in the chest

87
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,079
maybe a teeny bit more breathing in

88
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:12,320
a teeny bit longer letting go as you exhale

89
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,339
maybe a teeny pause before you inhale

90
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,899
and if you can feel some pleasure

91
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:05,839
let that support the mind to be present here now

92
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:13,700
in some ways the mind is attracted to what is Pleasant

93
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:22,139
allow it to feel the pleasantness of the moment as a way of supporting you to be here

94
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,860
and now

95
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:42,779
to help you settle down and relax to help the Mind Trust

96
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:47,000
being present here and now

97
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,340
to no Pleasant present moment pleasure

98
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,020
we have to be aware

99
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:23,100
allowing awareness to be receptive to receive

100
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:29,880
the pleasure that it knows the simplest pleasure of the moment here

101
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:36,360
and now in breathing and sitting here maybe the pleasure

102
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,919
that comes with meditation

103
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:55,020
if there is unpleasant Sensations experiences

104
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:03,179
is there a way of holding them or relating to them

105
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:08,158
from the places of pleasure pleasantness

106
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,780
maybe taking them both in as you breathe

107
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,980
so that there's not a fixation on what is uncomfortable

108
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,760
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

109
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:08,179
are there people for whom if you think about

110
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:14,100
you feel pleasure that's Pleasant it's enjoyable it's

111
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:20,059
evokes good feelings to think about certain people

112
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,760
let yourself feel the pleasure of

113
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:37,200
recalling people in your life you enjoy your who you love for who you

114
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,700
care for nicely the love the Friendship the good will

115
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:51,080
you feel might be the source of that Pleasant pleasure

116
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,080
the Delight

117
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:04,640
and to relax into that pleasure of knowing them thinking of them

118
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:14,419
feeling the pleasantness if it's there

119
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:24,980
and then imagine that from that Pleasant pleasure you can gaze out upon all people

120
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:32,279
the people you love care for the people you are neutral to

121
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:38,960
even the people you're troubled by you can look upon them

122
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,620
with kind Pleasant gaze

123
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,600
and wish them well is there a way that coming out of

124
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:01,620
meditation that you have access to a different kind of well-wishing

125
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:08,059
than you usually have one that's more spacious open

126
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,658
less reactive

127
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:19,799
may all beings be happy

128
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:28,380
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

129
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,659
and may all beings be free

130
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,740
[Music]

131
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:44,299
[Music]

132
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,520
thank you

133
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,279
so good morning or today hello and

134
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:15,600
here to give the second talk on the mindfulness check-in

135
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,539
and how to uh use mindfulness the classic mindfulness

136
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:27,679
teaching on the three foundations as a way of freeing ourselves from

137
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,940
unhealthy unuseful preoccupations with the challenges difficulties we have in

138
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:38,520
our life it's not a denial that we have challenges

139
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:46,200
but it's possible all too easy for us to become fixated on them in a unuseful way

140
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,480
we can get preoccupied we can ruminate we can repeat the same kind of

141
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,720
uh [Music] fear-based thoughts about what will

142
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:05,820
happen what it all means what's going to happen to us we can possible to steam in in anger and

143
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:13,980
just kind of be cut up in the endless story of blame and who did what and just angry and about someone

144
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:19,919
of course there might be reasons to be afraid reasons to be angry

145
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:26,820
but to ruminate with it to persist in it and spin in it is uh

146
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:32,640
is one way an unhealthy way of placing Our Life Energy placing our

147
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,039
attention and it limits it Narrows the scope of a way how we can be present for

148
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:44,460
what is here and so and even just spending a lot of time thinking about things

149
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,860
it limits Our Lives thinking has a role but to be lost in

150
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:56,159
thought so when the Buddha taught the four foundations of mindfulness

151
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,500
there is no obvious place in there to be mindful of thinking we often will teach

152
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,960
mindfulness of thinking this is how there is a place but in that teachings of the Buddha there's no

153
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,840
obvious way and I think he knew very well that people think a lot in fact he gives

154
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:19,440
instructions elsewhere of how to work with destructive thoughts but I think in the in the classic

155
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,140
teachings of mindfulness um he offers a different way of being

156
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:30,240
present for our direct experience that's not mediated so much through our

157
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,700
thinking and that is rather than see things

158
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:41,100
through the lens of what we're thinking and how we're thinking and is to drop into these four different

159
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:47,580
areas through kind of tease apart these four areas of the totality of our experience

160
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:52,980
and that is to be aware of how things are experienced physically

161
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:59,880
in the body how things are either Pleasant or unpleasant

162
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,100
the pleasure and or the discomfort of things

163
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:12,360
the Mind States and then the mental processes today the topic is the second

164
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:19,080
they What's called the feeling tone of experience and when we go through the checklist and

165
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:26,159
say I'm having some difficulty and um and it didn't happen today but it almost

166
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,380
happened uh coming down here at the IMC to teach a little bit late later than

167
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:37,500
usual and so I could be could have been preoccupied about no I need to get here

168
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:43,919
I'll be late what will happen and uh how am I going to be efficient when I get there to set everything up and and I

169
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:50,159
could be spinning that way so that would be the challenge the challenge of being late in my preoccupation and

170
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:57,480
and and worry around that once I notice that's happening then I

171
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:04,140
give myself a checklist no it's happening in the body I'm agitated what's happening to feeling tones it's

172
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:10,440
unpleasant what's happening in mind State it's gotten narrow

173
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:16,040
and tight and what's happened in the mental processes

174
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,480
I'm caught up in a certain degree of worry a certain degree of of

175
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,358
um of a little bit aversion to feeling the way I'm feeling

176
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,060
and then if I look at that checklist I say well the most interesting place maybe the

177
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:39,000
strongest place is actually it feels uncomfortable the whole thing let me look at the discomfort let me

178
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,240
that that's the important place to bring attention to and sometimes that's enough

179
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:50,760
because that's enough to me to recognize that I'm tense and so then I can relax

180
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,800
I can soften around this how I'm feeling and that kind of opens the field and

181
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,080
relaxes the whole thing without having to figure it all out in

182
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:07,020
my thoughts and ideas and be stuck there so that's a simple way that mindfulness

183
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:12,780
can work but for the Buddha the attention to the feeling tone can be

184
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:20,040
revolutionary and it was for the Buddha because when he discovered some of the pleasures and

185
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,440
joy of meditation he asked himself do I need to be afraid of this

186
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:33,119
and he said no it's okay to experience this pleasure and this kind of in a very you know

187
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:40,200
distant way is a little bit a little bit mimics my experience of meditation over these years I've meditated

188
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:47,520
that in the first 10 years of meditation or so I had no idea

189
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:54,060
exactly it was discouraged from feeling any pleasure if you talk went to the meditation teacher and talked about

190
00:35:54,060 --> 00:36:00,720
you're feeling Pleasant or pleasure you were told let go of that just kind of stay present be with the emptiness of

191
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,720
things be with just the just sit and not focus on anything just let go of it let go

192
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,839
and there was no way of acknowledging and even though I would sit in meditation in that tradition and have

193
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:19,079
sometimes really good feelings of being present they were never validated or given a place

194
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:25,140
and when I started studying vipassana I eventually discovered there's actually

195
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:31,619
a very important place and it's okay to experience pleasure it's part of what it means to be human

196
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:39,180
being is to have pleasure but in fact don't be attached to it don't strive and struggle to have it

197
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:44,460
don't expect it but do allow yourself to feel it

198
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:51,140
and it can be revolutionary when the mind is

199
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:56,760
preoccupied with what's uncomfortable if the Mind spins out in fear or in

200
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:03,540
anger or distress or grief or sadness all those emotions are part of human

201
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:10,500
life and certainly don't want to deny them or or cut them off directly

202
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:17,460
but but the preoccupation rhythm and the preoccupation with these kinds

203
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:25,140
of difficulties and challenges becomes the fuel for the challenge to be bigger and persists longer

204
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:32,040
and so we have to somehow be able to moderate or monitor how we're what we're

205
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:38,820
fueling and what we're feeding and growing and in person and

206
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:45,000
maintaining and so uh it isn't that we're not

207
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,940
supposed to feel some discomfort but maybe it's not necessary to feed it

208
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:58,320
and there's something powerful that happens if we start tuning into the pleasure the pleasantness of the moment

209
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:07,740
that isn't doesn't not meant to be a denial of what's unpleasant but it's a way of of uh moderating or finding our

210
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:14,460
way with what's unpleasant there's a different reference point there's a different way in which our

211
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:20,940
attention is being fed or attentions being conditioned it's been conditioned by what's Pleasant

212
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:26,280
rather than persisting with what's unpleasant so some people might protest around this

213
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:34,619
kind of idea and that's you know maybe reasonable to some degree but if you're pay careful attention

214
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:40,500
to our mind's reactivity and what we what we're feeding what we're influence

215
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:47,099
the ruminations the spinning of the mind is having and you find out that a persistent way

216
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:53,460
of thinking a persists in the way of kind of being caught and is fueling your

217
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:59,579
feelings fueling the distress fueling the sense of emotional challenge that's going on

218
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:06,359
that also is not very useful it can actually spin out and you know if you really spin out in a

219
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:13,980
panic attack or really spiral downward it's really good to uh to go do

220
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:19,880
something different that's enjoyable go find a kitten to play with

221
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:27,599
many years ago I used to take long showers when I was really spinning out with with fear and that was somehow

222
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,760
settle anything the pleasure of the shower go for a walk where you can enjoy trees

223
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,880
and skies or something and

224
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,079
finding something pleasant to do when we're in danger of spinning out with our

225
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:49,740
preoccupation is a very good intervention and to settle the nervous system to

226
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:55,079
quiet things down and and then we'll be in a better place

227
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:02,520
to come back and address the issue not a few people have found that taking a hey a pleasure break

228
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,680
to going off and doing something enjoyable playing with a kitten

229
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,220
and then coming back later to address the challenges we have they're in such a better place to reflect on and think

230
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:19,800
about it wisely or do what needs to be done so that's a common kind of everyday kind

231
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:26,339
of thing that people can do but we also learned to do that in meditation and through mindfulness

232
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:32,400
we learn to not prioritize the unpleasant not prioritize the negativity

233
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:39,960
bias that we might have in all kinds of ways it plays out and when but for many people starting to

234
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:47,339
feel more pleasure and the pleasantness of life and here now is is just bringing things into balance

235
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:55,320
when we're in balance in the direction of what's uncomfortable and as we start feeling the pleasant the

236
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,680
pleasure of what's comfortable and give ourselves more time for that that

237
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:06,079
begins having a different conditioning on our emotional life our mental state

238
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,820
it tends to um change the energy level of what's being

239
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:18,599
energized and being you know spinning out and it tends to energize healing

240
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:25,500
States Pleasant States per year it's a lot easier to be with our challenges emotional challenges mental

241
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:31,140
challenges worldly challenges if we can hold it in a place of being

242
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:38,119
calm open Pleasant kind of at ease in the world and enjoying it

243
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:46,260
so to to go through the mindfulness checklist and when you get to the you know is this

244
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:52,619
Pleasant or unpleasant The Experience there's two things you that are important you can say you

245
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:58,079
notice that that's where the pleasant Enterprise that's where the Salient aspect that's the big that seems to be

246
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,780
the significant thing I want to bring my attention to so of those four things in the checklist

247
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:09,000
you might spend sometimes more time with the second

248
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,160
and sometimes all that's necessary is to know it well and be present for how it is

249
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:21,180
present for the unpleasant that just that can change things but sometimes you want to bring a

250
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:27,380
balance into the whole system by intentionally focusing more on what's Pleasant

251
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:32,940
not manufacturing it not going out and getting alcohol to make it Pleasant not

252
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:38,880
doing something that's too artificial or too contrived or something which doesn't have a good influence on you

253
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,520
but healthy forms of pleasure may be forms of pleasure that don't require

254
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:51,300
doing anything but rather you know different than what you're doing but rather availing

255
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:57,420
yourself of the pleasure that's already here and that's what we can do in meditation

256
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:03,599
what's already here and can that be a support for being with even the difficulties

257
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:11,460
can I let that meditation pleasure can I take it in fully and don't be and if in the course of

258
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:17,520
meditation pleasure arises even the pleasure of being a bit calmer than you were before

259
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:24,900
let that register receive that let that be don't be in this old school uh dismissing you know

260
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:32,220
can't be attached to that yeah don't be attached if you can but you're allowed to feel it and take it in

261
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:37,440
be nourished there's a way healthy wholesome

262
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,700
pleasures of meditation of mindfulness of being and learning how to be with ourselves

263
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:51,020
have a healing force on us so in this way hopefully I've conveyed

264
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:58,020
that the Buddha's emphasis on feelings feeling tones and the pleasure is a

265
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:03,780
revolutionary thing for some people to focus on and it's a game changer

266
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:11,579
so maybe at least for this next 24 hours it can be the game that you play explore

267
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:17,339
the certainly explore the world of how you've experienced Pleasant and unpleasant

268
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:22,619
how do you react how do you what's your reactivity way of

269
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:28,380
being with things that feel unpleasant and what's your belief in reaction and

270
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:36,560
comfort level with what is Pleasant and can you allow yourself to notice

271
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:42,380
more of the pleasures that are already here

272
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:48,720
can you switch the maybe the negativity bias that some people have

273
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,880
to what's unpleasant to begin to give a richer Fuller

274
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:59,520
experience of what is Pleasant and may that be really beneficial and

275
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,040
support this Dharma practice we're on and support your ability to have a

276
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:12,799
realistic and useful way of being with challenges so thank you
