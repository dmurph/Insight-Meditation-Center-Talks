1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,799
so hello it's nice to see all of you coming on

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:14,000
joining from so many places in the world and we'll be continuing with this

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,240
theme of mindfulness as protection looking at different aspects of that

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,000
every day so why don't we go ahead and get right

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,078
into the meditation today so finding a

6
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,680
posture where you'll be able to sit for a little while

7
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,800
just tuning in to the sensations of the body sitting

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,320
you can close your eyes if that's comfortable for you

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:05,280
it's often helpful at the beginning of the sit to just check in with the posture

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,960
so you know feeling the the body is upright and balanced

11
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,400
where it's sitting [Music] or even if you're lying down there can

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,000
still be a sense of straightness in the spine

13
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,240
and often we can feel the energy associated with the

14
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:42,479
straightness or uprightness of the body and balance that against uh relaxation

15
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,840
so it's not a tense or bolt upright straightness but

16
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:56,240
a relaxed [Music] almost raising up of the body as if it were being pulled from above

17
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,240
and then we just settle in to that

18
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,920
we can take a longer deeper breath than usual

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,680
and on the out breath just soften around that

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,200
straight central part of the body so softening the face

21
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:37,080
the jaw the shoulders the arms

22
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,000
the

23
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,440
legs and then inside the body

24
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,040
softening the heart area

25
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,840
and the belly

26
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,480
and then tuning in to the sensations of the breathing

27
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,640
when the body is at least somewhat relaxed there can be a sense of the

28
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:46,519
breath washing through the tissues of the body

29
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:55,599
it's a bit of an imagination but we don't have to think of the breath as just being in the lungs

30
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,159
it can be helpful to feel it throughout the body

31
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,759
and just as we had a sense of alertness and also

32
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,800
ease or relaxation in the body in the mind we can also

33
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,360
sense the alertness but it's a relaxed alertness

34
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:55,479
perhaps fueled by a an interest in our experience

35
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,000
so often we don't take the time or sometimes even have the

36
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,199
time to tune in deeply to our experience

37
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,759
we're busy with something in the outer world and now is a chance to really listen

38
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,560
really tune in

39
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,759
so again we consider we can consider the sensations of the breath

40
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:53,360
to be like a home base to which the mind can

41
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,880
return or wake up to at any time

42
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,919
but the sensations of the breath are not the only thing happening of course there may be

43
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,960
other body sensations and there's sound

44
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,560
there may be a dominant emotion or mood

45
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,919
and there may be various thoughts so it's okay that these other things are

46
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:54,400
happening we could just think of them as being on

47
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,080
the back burner while the breath is more on the front burner

48
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,160
or that these other things happen and we breathe through them kind of

49
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,039
favoring the ex feeling of the breath but these other things are there

50
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,280
more softly

51
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:32,000
so this kind of meditation allows there to be multiple experiences

52
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:39,440
and it can be that the mind will switch the positions of the breath and

53
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,279
something else and go off into thinking or

54
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:54,519
listening and if that's the case when we notice

55
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,680
we can just bring the breath back into the foreground

56
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,399
and if you'd like for this meditation you could also just note

57
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:18,080
what it was that the mind was doing when it was caught up in something

58
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,760
like hearing or thinking

59
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,040
or a body sensation and we just note that

60
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:37,360
so that we know and then continue on in a simple way with the meditation it's kind of an easy

61
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,360
investigation

62
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,760
one of the most common things that the mind will get caught up in

63
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,519
is a thought trail very normal

64
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:00,480
because the mind thinks that's that's what it does so there's certainly nothing

65
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:08,000
to criticize in that but it can be interesting

66
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,959
if you'd like if this doesn't feel too busy

67
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:20,160
to make a little bit further investigation of thought in particular

68
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:28,560
when the mind is on a long thought trail it's called pancha

69
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,839
which means proliferation [Music] and the

70
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:43,200
the main three things going on during proliferation of thought

71
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,279
are either craving or conceit

72
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,760
or views so there's no judgment of these things

73
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,079
but it's it's often that we're wanting something or that would include not wanting

74
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,600
something or we're explaining something about

75
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,800
ourselves how we are how we compare to someone else

76
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,880
or we're stating our position on something

77
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,720
explaining it figuring it out

78
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,519
so craving concedes and views so we could on the

79
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,600
noting of the thought we could also if it's simple enough just

80
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,480
note which of these three seems prominent and if it's not obvious then then it's

81
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,959
just thinking it doesn't matter so much

82
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,519
sometimes it's interesting to know what we're trading our piece for

83
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:17,760
when we investigate in this way we may come to realize that there's a

84
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,039
certain grace to the return of mindfulness

85
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:32,080
since we weren't present we didn't do that

86
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:39,480
so it's something of a gift that mindfulness reappears

87
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:47,039
when the mind has been wandering we can be happy for that

88
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:55,200
although we didn't do it in that moment there is some momentum generated from

89
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,840
earlier practice so we can enjoy that

90
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:10,080
return of mindfulness that sense of brightness and presence returning

91
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,679
i appreciate the gift

92
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,369
so in the last few minutes of this sitting [Music]

93
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:52,400
we might bring to mind just how much of the suffering in the

94
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,679
world comes from

95
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,200
these three things craving conceits and views

96
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:10,480
first of all internally for the person who is

97
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,559
wrapped up in that because we can see that in ourselves

98
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:22,880
and then also actions that are taken

99
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,760
based on these things

100
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:40,000
it's just part of how it is to be human that we have these streams in our mind

101
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
and it's mindfulness that helps us see that and

102
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,840
be disentangled from it

103
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,799
so mindfulness is our natural protection from

104
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,080
into these streams or

105
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:15,080
domains of unwholesome tendencies in the mind

106
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,440
so for today we could be happy for the moments of

107
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:30,880
mindfulness the stretches of mindfulness during which we know we won't be

108
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:38,640
acting on these forces that aren't so helpful

109
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:51,039
and it may even be that our mindfulness or our presence could help someone else not to act

110
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:59,279
on such things we can't assume that or try to make it that way

111
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,039
but it may be that way

112
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:14,240
so this wonderful gift of presence that arrives on its own in a sense

113
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,440
it's a great protection for ourselves and others

114
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,980
[Music]

115
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:11,109
[Music]

116
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:26,970
[Music]

117
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:39,120
so we'll be continuing with this theme of mindfulness as a protection

118
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,679
and we'll be using various different images to build up maybe a bigger picture

119
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,799
of the multifaceted way that mindfulness operates

120
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:58,559
and a lot of that has to do with protection in various forms so we started out with the fundamental

121
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:05,440
idea that mindfulness is a good protection for us and then today

122
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:12,080
we're actually going to talk about the flip side of that which is the danger of not being mindful

123
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:19,519
and the buddha gave a number of images that are about this seems that he was quite willing to

124
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:26,640
approach from the side of of danger maybe for some minds that works well

125
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:33,919
and um and then we'll talk about ways to address that danger including something that the buddha himself did

126
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:40,399
in his practice so the reason that we would need

127
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:45,679
protection such as through mindfulness is because there is genuine danger in

128
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,799
our situation as humans i don't want to over dramatize that but

129
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,840
we can certainly see i think in our own mind that there are a lot of

130
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,000
long-standing habits not all of which are beneficial you know

131
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,720
you know we may not be acting on these various things going on in our mind but we can't deny that they're there when we

132
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:16,080
have mindfulness so again not to worry that's normal for humans everyone who's born as human

133
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,679
has various kinds of greed hatred and delusion that comes with the territory

134
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:29,360
they're actually not very personal even though they have their specific manifestations for us

135
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,120
so as i was reviewing various images about mindfulness i couldn't help

136
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:42,640
but notice that there really are quite a few that relate to the danger of non-mindfulness so i thought we'd look

137
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:50,320
at just a few of them today so one of them is about a a beauty queen

138
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:57,279
and i'm sorry for the gendered imagery in this suta you're you're very welcome to alter it in your mind

139
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,960
however it's appropriate so the buddha is telling the monks

140
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,159
a story about a beauty queen who is

141
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,519
walking through a city and singing and dancing as a large crowd of

142
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:19,440
people gathers around and so then he goes on to say

143
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,880
then a person would come along wishing to live not wishing to die

144
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:32,799
wishing for happiness averse to suffering and someone would say you must carry around this bowl of oil

145
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:39,760
filled to the brim between the crowd and the beauty queen and a man with a drawn sword will be

146
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,200
following right behind you and wherever you spill even a little bit of it

147
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,240
right there he will fell your head so what do you think would that person

148
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:59,200
stop attending to that bowl of oil and out of negligence turn their attention outwards and amongst say no

149
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,399
so the buddha goes on to say i have made up this simile in order to convey a

150
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:10,240
meaning and here is the meaning the bowl of oil filled to the brim is a

151
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,679
designation for mindfulness directed to the body so

152
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,720
there you have it the sense that we could walk

153
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:27,760
with a bowl of oil filled to the brim in the midst of a jostling excited crowd

154
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,118
and not spill any of it so it's pointing toward the importance of

155
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,320
precision i don't know that we need the anxiety that might go along with an image like

156
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,240
that but it does you know it does convey the importance i think the buddha was trying

157
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,560
to relate in that case then there are also two images given

158
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:58,240
that relate to an idea of a homeland or a domain where it is safe for us to dwell

159
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:06,560
and then outside of that it's dangerous so i'll just we'll take a look at those

160
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:13,839
there's another suta where the buddha is talking about places where hunters set up traps of

161
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:19,839
pitch in order to catch monkeys and so it says those monkeys who are not

162
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:25,119
foolish and frivolous when they see the pitch avoided from afar

163
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:32,079
but a monkey who is foolish approaches the pitch and seizes it with his hand and he gets caught

164
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,920
and then thinking i will free my hand he seizes it with the other hand and gets caught

165
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,200
and then thinking i will free both hands he seizes it with a foot and then the other foot

166
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:49,520
and then the muzzle and so he gets caught in five different places and so

167
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,640
the buddha goes on to say please do not stray outside your own

168
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,960
resort into the domain of others mara will gain access to those who stray

169
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,440
outside mara being the in this case the forces of distraction in the mind

170
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,680
and what is the resort you know what is the place where we should remain safe

171
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,680
it is the four establishments of mindfulness so

172
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:27,920
i i can relate to this monkey image and that there can be times where i know the mind is caught up and my my attempts to

173
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,160
free it i say oh i shouldn't think about that i'm going to try to think about something else then the mind is actually just

174
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,480
continuing to think in some way and so then there's this sort of ongoing

175
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,839
finally there's a realization oh i just need to i need to drop this effort it's not

176
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:51,119
going in the right direction oh and i said there were two of these

177
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:57,760
images about the homeland or the safety so the second one is about a quail that is

178
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,320
um living in a field and it's being attacked by a hawk when it uh leaves

179
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:11,599
leaves the field it's a similar kind of image as the monkey and in both of these sutas the the

180
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:18,000
dangerous place is specifically said to be the five chords of sensual pleasure

181
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,599
you know meaning eye ear tongue knows body so the usual ways where we would want to seek comfort or pleasure the

182
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:32,480
things that occupy the mind and then the safe place is the four establishments of mindfulness

183
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:39,520
so it's important to note that although the similes are about

184
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:47,040
physical places because that's easy to imagine what the buddha names as safety is not

185
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:54,240
actually a physical place but a stance of our mind so we're safe when the mind is mindful

186
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:02,480
so he's not saying that we need to be locked up in our house with the door bolted in order to be safe

187
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,320
he's saying instead that there's something to do with how our mind is

188
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:14,560
so we begin maybe with we begin with this practice of guarding the sense doors

189
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,000
that's what we talked about yesterday and usually when people start they find it

190
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:27,520
useful to actually avoid situations that are particularly triggering and that is totally fine when

191
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,119
we do actually have that choice it can be skillful to do that and for instance

192
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:39,119
people who are in recovery should definitely choose not to go to bars

193
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:47,280
or we may choose not to go to a big noisy party if we don't have to go or maybe we would

194
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:54,079
simply be more subtle and just choose to have fewer conversations with our neighbor whose political views are very

195
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,200
different from ours so that's fine to do

196
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:06,079
but in the end the buddha is pointing toward the real danger being from within it's our own

197
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,760
lack of mindfulness or our own lack of capacity with mindfulness

198
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,520
so like strengthening muscles we have to exercise mindfulness in order

199
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:24,240
to grow our capacity and you may have already seen in your practice that there once you started

200
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:31,119
cultivating mindfulness there came to be situations where in the past it would have been very difficult

201
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,240
to stay mindful or to be skillful and then one day

202
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,800
you're you're present for it and you realize oh i didn't i didn't automatically lash out when i i

203
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,320
think i would have a couple of months ago and so we realized oh my capacity has

204
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,680
grown a little bit and so it so this is nice to when we notice it

205
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,359
spontaneously but i want to talk a little bit about deliberately

206
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:05,599
cultivating our capacity so at some point just like we would have to increase the

207
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,800
weight stack at the gym we'll probably have to venture into more

208
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,640
challenging situations and try to remain mindful in them kind of

209
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,839
move into new domains expand the domain of safety for our mind

210
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:29,200
so we're not you know we're not seeking out difficulty willy-nilly but it is really a kind of a fun point

211
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:36,800
in practice when we start doing little experiments to see if we can be mindful in more challenging situations

212
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:43,119
so we're trying to stay in the safe domain of mindfulness but gradually develop what is needed so

213
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:49,359
that that domain gets larger and the buddha talks about doing this in

214
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,119
his own practice at one point this is before he was awakened so there is a

215
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:01,760
suta entitled fear and dread where the buddha deliberately went to

216
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,079
scary forests scary forest places to practice in order to remain mindful

217
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,359
during the experience of fear and dread so there's a lot in the suta and i'm

218
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:20,560
just singling out one point for today but one of the key points is that he

219
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,920
consciously considered ahead of time before he went into the situation he

220
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,119
consciously considered that he possesses certain good qualities

221
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,040
including mindfulness so he actively reminded himself before

222
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,160
going into the woods that he is ethical he's mindful he's

223
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:48,880
caring and even has some degree of wisdom and this sort of buoyed up his mind and

224
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:56,480
heart so that he could stay aware even during experiences that were bringing up fear

225
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,880
so we can do this also in our own lives there was a time when i

226
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,920
did a program in uh chaplaincy training and

227
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:15,599
when i this is a while ago and when i started the program i didn't really have i didn't have any experience with

228
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,839
going into hospitals and meeting people there and talking with them and part of the

229
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:29,280
training in this program is that we needed to do volunteer work and i i chose to go into a hospital

230
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:35,599
and i joined the spiritual care volunteer team and i would have to go into rooms with

231
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:42,400
very little information about you know i didn't know anything about what was wrong with the person or anything about

232
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:49,839
their background or very much at all i think you get their name and their religion listed on the sheet

233
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:55,200
and um i would go in and i would offer myself you know how can i be helpful

234
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:01,920
here would you like to talk and at the beginning i was i didn't know how to do that and i felt quite

235
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,800
uh nervous of course i had some you know i was going to the training program so i had some ideas of where to start but it

236
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,440
took the practice of doing it to be able to be present and mindful in situations

237
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,440
like that that were very unclear or uncertain and just lead from the heart and

238
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:29,359
see what i could do so that was very good training and it did expand the domain in which i was

239
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:34,480
more comfortable with being with with challenging situations

240
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:41,839
so you can try this as you approach a challenging situation is to bolster the confidence ahead of time by

241
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:47,119
bringing to mind some kind of inspiration from our practice we could

242
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:53,280
recollect our own good qualities as the buddha did and it's also recommended that we can

243
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,359
recollect the buddha the dharma the sangha you know other inspiring themes for us

244
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:07,359
and then and then you can let those go and just go into the situation intending to be mindful and see what comes up

245
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:13,680
so we're working with this idea of danger and protection

246
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,440
and with the protection of mindfulness more and more of the world looks safe to

247
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,960
us we're safe from things that are essentially alluring or things that

248
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,160
bring up aversion or cause agitation in some way

249
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,720
and when we have that through the establishments of mindfulness it's a kind of safety that we can carry around

250
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:44,400
with us so we become free in our own awareness no matter what the situation

251
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:50,160
of course it's it takes a while it's a long process to to expand that so i want

252
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:58,000
to respect that process very much but we can maybe be inspired that awakened people can go anywhere in peace

253
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:06,319
and safety everywhere safe for them so may your range of mindfulness and safety

254
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:11,920
keep expanding as you continue to practice you might consider

255
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:20,920
if there are conscious ways that you could do that so thank you we'll continue tomorrow
