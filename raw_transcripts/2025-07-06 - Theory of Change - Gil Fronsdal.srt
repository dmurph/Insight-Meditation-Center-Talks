1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:09,120
So good morning everyone and welcome and uh for today's talk I'd like to

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,880
bring up a topic uh and the purpose of bringing up this

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:22,240
topic is not to offer some definitive teachings on it that comes to a nice

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,119
great conclusion but rather to um inspire you

5
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:35,520
maybe I don't know if provoke you is the right word but evoke in you uh

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,719
uh reflection that you would think more deeply about this topic and how it works

7
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:50,000
for you personally and I think it's a very important topic for us as individuals in our own

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,039
individual life in our interpersonal life in our societal life to really

9
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:04,799
reflect deeply about this and uh and understand uh how this works for us because this

10
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,720
topic I'm going to bring up I'll name it shortly

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,119
is um uh we probably all have all

12
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,439
operating with it with it but it's often unexamined and unconsidered

13
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:28,400
and so what I'm encouraging here is to take this topic and really consider it how it is for you.

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,840
So the topic is what is your theory of change?

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,200
What is your theory of change? And so if you're involved in changing

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,320
yourself, changing your family, your community, your your society, your

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,520
world, you are you operating under some theory,

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,240
some hypothesis, some assumptions about how change happens.

19
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,600
And I encounter a lot of people who want to see change but uh they've never examined their

20
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,040
theory of change. They have a gut reaction and they have some idea of

21
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,920
course this is how it should be you know which and uh so sometimes it's very aggressive. Some people want something

22
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,040
to be different and their idea is to bark or worse and uh be hostile to get

23
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,239
what they want to be happen. Other people's theory of change is to fawn and

24
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:39,840
to kind of just be very gentle and kind and they're trying to get something but

25
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,440
they think this is how you get things is to make something happen.

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,319
So when we're involved in Buddhist practice uh are you involved in any process of

27
00:02:52,319 --> 00:03:00,160
change? Are you looking for a change when you're practicing? And if so, what is your theory of

28
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,239
change? How is that change supposed to happen? And um and what is the

29
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,159
understanding of how it happens? What needs to be done to be happen? And uh or

30
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,879
do you just take it take some the word of some poor teacher

31
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:25,200
who says uh yes, it's really good to meditate. You should everyone should meditate. Oh, okay.

32
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,599
You'll feel so much better if you meditate. Okay. Well, okay. That's the my theory of change is I'll just follow

33
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:38,000
this teacher's word. Um uh that so that you have a theory

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,879
unexamined theory that believing in someone else is what's going to help you find your way.

35
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,959
So often it's unexamined and to ask yourself the question, what

36
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,879
theory do you have? What beliefs do you have around how change happens and is it

37
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,319
really been examined and can it be examined more deeply? Can it be

38
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,599
reconsidered? Are there better theories of how change happens?

39
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:14,080
And um and so there's a few things um but I thought in this regard I I came

40
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:21,280
across this quote by EB White from his book um from the book Charlotte's Web

41
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,320
that uh says something like um every morning I awake

42
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,759
wanting to change the world.

43
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,280
uh or every morning I wake up uh torn

44
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,720
torn between the desire to change the world

45
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:54,039
and the inclination to savor it. This makes it very difficult to plan.

46
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,560
So you know how do we live in this world? Is this world a world that is

47
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,039
dire need of us to change? is about to fall apart and or is this a world where it's okay

48
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,720
to enjoy the holiday or enjoy the Sunday and go to the park and just enjoy the

49
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:20,080
natural wonder of this world and um and how do we manage these two views to say

50
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,479
it in other terms um do we um

51
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:33,919
do we care for our life or do we enjoy our life.

52
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:41,199
Do we change our life or do we enjoy the life we have? So there's a whole series of things to

53
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,039
examine in these questions of change and theories of change. And one of the first

54
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:54,240
uh things to examine is so I'll offer some of these ideas of theories of change and then I'll offer a

55
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,800
Buddhist theory of change at the end. So you'll get the Buddhist part if you want

56
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,319
and um so the f the first thing is we have to

57
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:12,960
begin with is with what we see. How do we understand the current circumstances?

58
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,440
What do we see in the current circumstances? Do we see that the sky is falling

59
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,800
and we have to run? Do we see that the world is burning

60
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,880
and there's nowhere to run? Is what we see hopeless

61
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:43,840
and all you can do is kind of give up or do we see that um

62
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,319
fires that we can put out and no one else is going to do it so we should? Do

63
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:58,240
we see a world where goodness prevails? Do we see a world where evil prevails?

64
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,199
Do we see what do we how do we interpret the world? How do what do we see? How do we see ourselves?

65
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,880
Some people see themselves in very negative ways. See themselves as somehow

66
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,280
wrong in all the different ways that could be. Some people see themselves as wrong and that's this is how it is.

67
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:24,720
They're stuck that way. Some people see themselves as being way too right.

68
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,599
Everything is right about me and everyone else needs to understand that too. And uh and I should be praised and

69
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:39,840
I everything everything I say must be true. And um well how do we see?

70
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:47,759
And so the question is what are we seeing? And are we seeing accurately? Are we seeing in a useful way? And some

71
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:55,840
people have this belief that if I see it, it must be true. I'll if I see it, I'll believe it. But

72
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,160
that is kind of naive because often how we see is through the lens of

73
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:09,360
interpretation, through the lens of of desires, through the lens of aversions.

74
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,759
And um and sometimes uh how we see has been shaped by culture, shaped by

75
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,800
family, shaped by religion, shaped by politicians.

76
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,039
And so the way we see is not so always so accurate. So that makes this whole

77
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:34,640
question of a theory of a change difficult from the very beginning. It requires really a careful consideration

78
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,680
of what is it that I'm what's up here? What's going on here with me? What's

79
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:47,440
going on here with my family? What's going on here in my place of work? What's going up here in this nation, in

80
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,800
this world? And um and of course there are many

81
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,959
things to see. And so part of that what we see has to do with the se the choice

82
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:06,160
of our selection, what we choose to see and what we choose to ignore.

83
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:15,839
And uh and so that also makes it very comp complicated because there's already a preference that goes into how we see.

84
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,839
The way that this practice of ours can assist with this is that by calming

85
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:29,680
down, by quieting the discursive mind, we begin to let go of some of the

86
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,959
overlays, the projections, the preferences, the selectivity we have

87
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,720
that we we bring to whatever situation we're in. So, we're seeing it very

88
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:48,000
partially. We're seeing it through the lens of our desires. And it's remarkable to quiet the mind

89
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,880
down, to quiet the thinking mind down, to quiet the desiring mind down, and to be

90
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:03,040
able to see with fresh eyes. And I have not a few times been somehow

91
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:11,440
uh disturbed by how I saw a person through a filter that was not accurate.

92
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:19,040
uh maybe I had old information about the person and I hadn't seen how the person had changed. I wasn't ready to see the

93
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:26,560
something was a person that was showing up in a very different state than how I had known them. And so I operated under

94
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,399
assumptions that I knew the person and actually I didn't know what was salient

95
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,680
and important at the moment because I was operating on the story, the stories,

96
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,160
ideas, memories and all that. And I've had the wonderful experience of

97
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,399
being quiet and calm, settled, cleared that my mind has become clear and seeing

98
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,160
someone that I've known for a long time with fresh eyes.

99
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,720
Really kind of just kind of allowing them to be completely as they are without needing anything from them,

100
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,440
without wanting anything from them, without projecting it anything. I shouldn't be so absolute in my language

101
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,000
but all that go get gets reduced dramatically and so I see the person in a more whole

102
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,120
way. All this has been true with myself as

103
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,920
well. We do the same thing with ourselves. We see ourselves very partially. We see ourselves through the

104
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:34,000
lens of what our society expects of a person or doesn't expect of a person or

105
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,480
what society tells us what's important. I was um there was a a little story I've

106
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,240
told sometimes of so I moved to the I used to live in San

107
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,760
Francisco for quite a bit of time in uh one of the poor neighbors of San

108
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:58,079
Francisco and I was kind of a poor hippie and before before that and so I

109
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:05,040
had uh an old car and I was very happy with this old car. I had no no questions about it, no

110
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,440
issues around it. It was just my car. It was very simple and straightforward.

111
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:18,000
But then I moved uh down here to the peninsula and uh and and at first I was living up

112
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,399
on skyline this time was way up there in the woods kind of but I would come down

113
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,160
periodically to Palo Alto. The main reason to be in Palo Alto was to teach this group when we were in Palo Alto

114
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,959
days but I come down to Palo Alto and I have dinner. We taught I taught most first Monday nights had dinners and then

115
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:43,040
I would go and teach. And after a few years of this, I don't know when it was, it might have taken

116
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,360
four or five years where I I started to notice that I had

117
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,480
one of the oldest cars in Palo Alto because even back then a lot of people

118
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:05,440
had relatively new cars. And then one day there arose in my mind

119
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,920
I should get a new car. And there and it was really clear that

120
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:19,920
that desire was not because my car was falling apart and was on its last legs or was inadequate but because now I was

121
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,760
comparing myself to what was going on in my society around me. And somehow that

122
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,360
comparison generated this desire for a new car.

123
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,959
And um so that that's one thing about a car. What

124
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,399
about a new you? How are you comparing yourself to the people around you? Does

125
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,480
it change who how you understand yourself based on the community that you're with and what's around you all

126
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,760
the time? And I suspect some of you have lived in different communities in your life, growing up different places and

127
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:02,160
being here. Most of you, I assume, are kind of local. And I can imagine that your shifting

128
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,560
understanding of yourself and what it means to be a

129
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,639
right person is shaped by who you compare yourself to and what goes on. So

130
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:23,680
in that comparison, are you seeing yourself accurately? So you know my theory of change in 1995

131
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,680
I think was um uh I was involved the

132
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,839
change I wanted was to have a new car and what was the theory of change I

133
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,040
don't know but somehow change needed to be in response to what I saw around me

134
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,240
change need to be about maybe my status or how people saw me and that was part

135
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:54,000
of went into my idea of why change was necessary and how was and then how uh

136
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,760
was that uh to make that change. So I went I remember I went driving

137
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,639
around. I went to a few car dealers thinking I would get a new car and so I

138
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:13,120
think it was here in Paul in Redwood City then I think it was a Honda dealership that was here and so I was

139
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,040
driving like a little Honda Civic, a new Honda Civic

140
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:26,959
and um with windows you had to use your arms to turn. Remember that?

141
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:32,079
And uh and uh so I went for a drive and I guess I was driving the car and the

142
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,920
dealer was in the passenger seat and the dealer just over here near here I think

143
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:46,320
on Brewster. Remember coming up to light in El Camino and he was telling me

144
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:54,240
you deserve an air conditioner. [Laughter]

145
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,360
Wow, that idea had never crossed my mind that

146
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,000
I would just what did I do to deserve an air conditioner.

147
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,199
So, he was there to kind of create a whole idea about myself that um you know

148
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:19,199
I guess you know he was hoping I'd buy into. So, what do we see? Do we see is we're

149
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,920
not so innocent in seeing ourselves, seeing everything else. What is the lens through which we see it see things? What

150
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,160
is the emotion through which we see our life? Do we see it through fear? Do we see it

151
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,320
through inadequacy and insecurity? Do we see it through love? Do we see it

152
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,759
through generosity? Do we see it through uh the idea that

153
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:51,120
things are perfect? Is that terrible thing to say given how imperfect the world is? There are some

154
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:59,600
people whose spirituality is very much centered on seeing the perfection of this moment here how it is

155
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,880
that teacher Suzuki Roshi the Zen master in San Francisco um he made a big impact on a lot of

156
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:15,600
people when he he said you're perfect just as you are

157
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:22,400
and there's room for improvement. So he was holding both of them together.

158
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,600
There's something about just perfect and we can change.

159
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:34,480
So then the theory of change also involves what vision do you have for what's possible.

160
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,320
And um there are some people who believe who are in this field of change that's

161
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,640
called something called helotrop tropism. helotropic which means it literally means something like turning

162
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:54,160
with the sun following the sun that um uh the vision we have is what one of the

163
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,600
things that we follow. So if the vision we have is that as danger, fear about

164
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,080
terrible people, immigrants coming to do all kinds of horrible things to you. And

165
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:16,400
if that's the vision we have and we embibe this v vision, then what we see

166
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:23,520
is what needs to be done is affect affected by this future that we see coming. the vision of what's going to

167
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,280
happen. If we have a vision of peace, a vision

168
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,640
of a world where people are generous to each other, kind to each other, if we

169
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,760
see a vision of a family or a community or a sa like this, where we care for

170
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,600
each other, where we respect each other, where we allow each other to be exactly

171
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:52,559
who we are in some spacious kind of way. Um, accepting people

172
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:59,760
Uh that's that that vision then the theory is that um just having a vision

173
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:07,360
even subconsciously things begin orienting themselves in that direction just like a sunflower moves with the sun

174
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,880
and changes according to where the sun is. So something inside of us u can

175
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,320
start shifting and changing in profound subconscious unconscious ways depending

176
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:25,440
on the vision that we live by. So what vision do you live by? What sense of a future do you live by? What

177
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,039
sense of possibility do you have that is it one that inspires you or is it one

178
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:38,160
that deflates you? Is it one that's realistic or is it too much uh a

179
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:45,039
fantasy? But so a theory of change also involves a vision of what's possible.

180
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:52,480
And then the question is how does that change? If you have an idea of a change, how does it come about?

181
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,080
And um this the idea of theory of change I've thought about a fair amount in the last

182
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,520
year or so having to do with uh what's happening more broadly in this country

183
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:09,120
with politics and all that. And I see a lot of people including myself wanting

184
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,240
to react without ever considering the theory of change.

185
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,559
uh getting angry and yelling and making big protests as if that's going to cause

186
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:28,000
a change. Is that how change happens? How does change happen?

187
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,400
Some people believe that um change often happens with vision.

188
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,000
And if you have a great wonderful vision and one that you really stand behind

189
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,679
inspiring, that's more likely to happen. if you have in politics seemingly if you

190
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:52,960
have a real bad vision, a frightening vision, that what makes for some people to vote for you.

191
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,679
Um, but imagine if Martin Luther King instead of standing

192
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:05,919
in Washington and giving that wonderful speech, I have a dream,

193
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:14,039
imagine instead he gave a talk that was titled, I have a nightmare.

194
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:21,120
What a different world we'd be living in. So,

195
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:29,520
so one theory of change is that actually change happens begins happening with the vision we hold the sense of possibility

196
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:36,799
and another is that change happens by um the stories we tell and many of us are

197
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:43,120
telling personal stories that are undermining ourselves. Some people, some psychologists say that one of the

198
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:50,159
leading causes of depression is rumination. Ruminating means repeatedly chewing over

199
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,760
the same story, ideas about oneself, the same dire situation, same undermining,

200
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,240
deflating kind of story that we start to drain ourselves

201
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,480
of our vitality and we get depressed. And stories make a big difference. And

202
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,480
so when politicians say the same story all the time over and over again, uh it

203
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,960
can have a big huge effect if that's where we get our conditioning for how we're going to see the world and have a

204
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:28,320
vision. So stories the stories we tell and sometimes it's said that uh in in the

205
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,360
world of the academic study of religion

206
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,039
that religions mostly exist because of their stories not their doctrines

207
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:45,679
because we're telling stories about founders and different parts of religion

208
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:51,120
and um and then you know what does make change

209
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,799
I I have a wonder I have a term called the acupuncture point of change that was

210
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:03,280
inspired by a person who inspire has inspired me a lot is Mahatma Gandhi

211
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,799
that um so he was in he the British arrested him he was in jail in India in

212
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:16,159
his independence movement and he spent his time in jail considering what to do next what strategy how how he was going

213
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:22,559
to bring independence to to India so apparently spent I don't know how fair

214
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:28,880
amount of time in jail thinking about this. Finally, he was released and um

215
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,000
and he began to implement his strategy, his

216
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,520
strategy for change. He started the salt march.

217
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:47,039
He marched to the sea. The British had a uh a a tax or had a monopoly on salt,

218
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:53,919
salt production. So no one was allowed to collect salt except they had to buy it from the British and everyone had to

219
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,960
have salt. So um he marched to the sea and he went

220
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:06,240
into the water and somehow he picked up a little piece of salt

221
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,320
and that was enough to be arrested again. And that was and that brought the

222
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:20,080
British Empire down. That was the acupuncture point of change. That little thing made a huge

223
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:26,880
difference in kind of the the transition to moving in the direction. A lot more had to happen of course. But where's the

224
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,360
occupure change for us? If we look at the whole big

225
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,279
scenario of our life, our situation, how dire it is. Uh it's can be so

226
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:46,000
overwhelming and we think we have to take a sledgehammer to whatever is going on. Maybe.

227
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But is there an acupuncture of change? Is there a story? Is a particular act?

228
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,039
Is there something we can do? Where's that point that'll make a difference?

229
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:05,039
So, um, so do we have an acupuncture point

230
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:11,760
theory of change? Do we have a sledgehammer idea of change? Do we have a theory of change that someone else is

231
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:19,360
responsible? We outsource all change. If we want peace in this world, other

232
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,919
people are supposed to do it. Do we or do we insource it?

233
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:32,640
Do we always understand that we have a role?

234
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,400
I don't want to use necessarily the word responsibility, but we always begin what's my role? What can be my

235
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,880
contribution? what way can I in a generous way make the change that I want to see in the

236
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,799
world and uh and are you in the distress you

237
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:57,360
have about your family yourself politics anything are you a little bit

238
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,080
outsourcing the problem that the someone else is supposed to be involved in change

239
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,760
a theory of change that I've had is that um if I feel like I really need

240
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:16,000
something from some some people um and I feel strong need

241
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,559
rather than demanding it or rather than expecting it or doing something uh uh in

242
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,080
certain circumstances uh is if I if I have a need I offer it

243
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:36,320
to the others. So for example, if you have a need to be heard by someone and this is an a theory

244
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,320
of change. I was on the ethics committee. I did a lot of um mediating

245
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,440
ethics problems and my theory of change around

246
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:54,080
social conflict like this is that uh uh change doesn't happen until people fe

247
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,080
people people feel heard. So that I was operating under this assumption.

248
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:07,520
And so um then I lost track of what I was saying. I went on a little tangent. Can somebody

249
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,039
remind me? Offer to people. Oh yeah. Thank you. Offer to people what I like.

250
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:20,320
So sometimes I've wanted to be heard and so I will um uh I will make an effort to

251
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:27,520
really understand them and hear them and make sure they feel heard. And little bit the theory is that once they feel

252
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,279
settled and feel heard then they'll be interested in me. It doesn't always work

253
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:40,799
but it's kind of a better effort than the alternative but to offer to others and I've known wonderful stories uh

254
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:48,960
where people have had challenge in a relationship. A number of people told me this had to do with their in-laws

255
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:56,320
and uh and uh they started giving simple gifts very not expensive gifts this is

256
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,480
cheap small but starting giving gifts and that began to change the relationship

257
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,240
and so rather than getting a mediator with my in-laws and let's sit down and talk about our challenges

258
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:15,039
but you know these acts of kindness. So there's all these ideas of how do we

259
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:21,840
how do we institute change? How does change best happen? So in Buddhism also has a theory of

260
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,360
change. So um

261
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,039
one of the core principles of Buddhism is everything is changing all the time.

262
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:39,360
And it's the teachings on ana poly word for impermanence or inconstancy

263
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,960
that everything is changing. But change in uh the change that we live in, the

264
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:52,679
change in the world, change in ourselves, change in society is not random

265
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,720
and we have a role in that change

266
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:06,240
and that we our our contribution to the change is to either have the change move in a

267
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,520
wholesome direction or an unh wholesome direction. And that's kind of the two

268
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:17,120
different choices. I suppose sometimes it's neither, but either wholesome or

269
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,480
unh wholesome. And um and so it's a little bit like or

270
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,520
very much like uh going down a river

271
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:34,880
in a canoe with a rudder and um and the river is doing most of

272
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,399
the work of if you're in the current flowing down. But you see the sandbank,

273
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:46,320
you see the rapids on the side, one side of the river. And if you have enough

274
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,360
warning, you just adjust the rudder a little bit to avoid the danger and to

275
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,720
stay in the good current. So

276
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,720
uh here, uh the direction of the rudder makes a huge difference.

277
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,120
So the idea that we're living in a river of life is kind of a deep kind of

278
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,159
metaphor that Buddhism uses. And so we want to stay in the current is the

279
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,440
Buddhist metaphor to avoid the sandbanks, avoid the edges where the

280
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,039
tigers are waiting. Uh we we're trying to avoid the rapids.

281
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:30,960
And um and so it's what's what's wonderful here in this metaphor is that

282
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,960
um at the same time as avoiding the dangers, we're putting ourselves in the

283
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,960
good place. It's the same movement just switching the rudder. You have enough warning just

284
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:49,520
adjusting the rudder a little bit. So the way that theory of change works

285
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:57,200
in Buddhism is there is change. Buddhism is about instituting a change. Buddhism has a a

286
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,320
vision of change and and having that

287
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:09,120
vision is some in some places in Buddhism considered um uh a whole new

288
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:15,039
stage of practice. Uh the stage of having a vision before for a beginner

289
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,640
they don't they quite yet have the personal vision of what's possible. But

290
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,880
once we see it or have a sense of it or personal vision of how much peace our

291
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:34,159
hearts can have, how much freedom our hearts can have, how much ease and happiness and well-being that's possible

292
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:41,519
in our deep inner life. Wow, this is possible. Not only is it possible, but why should

293
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:48,240
I sacrifice it for these other purposes? This feels wholesome.

294
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:55,760
This feels whole. This feels now I feel whole with this sense of peace and well-being. This is possible. We might

295
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,799
not always feel this way. We might just have a hint of this possibility, but at

296
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:08,159
some point we in Buddhism that he has to have a vision of what's possible. And um and maybe it's mostly some

297
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:14,320
people's in more of a negative vision which is I don't have to suffer that

298
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:20,159
this way anymore. I've suffered a lot. I've wasted much of my life suffering

299
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:27,039
unnecessarily. This is no longer necessary. For some people, that's very motivating.

300
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:32,880
For some people, it's the other side of the hand of that that when we don't suffer, there's peace, there's

301
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:39,279
happiness. So there's a vision of what's possible.

302
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:46,799
And what's possible that vision is at the end of the river the ocean at the end in Buddhism there's a big ocean of

303
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,720
freedom that we can the river will take us to but we're adjusting the rudder all

304
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,840
the time and why this is an important metaphor

305
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:05,919
is that in in uh in the dharma we have a very important role so we can't we can't

306
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:12,399
outsource our peace we can't outsource they inner freedom we have to do it ourselves

307
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:18,880
we have to step up to the plate they say maybe on the other hand we have to realize

308
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,760
that it's not only up to us just like

309
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:32,640
it's not it you don't cause the the canoe to go down the river you just

310
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,679
create the conditions that allows the current to carry it

311
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,840
in Buddhism We don't create the change, the personal change we're looking for.

312
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,360
We create the conditions that allow the inner growth to happen.

313
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,679
The metaphor for change, personal change in Buddhism is a metaphor of growth.

314
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:03,200
That we're growing something. We're allowing something, some natural processes inside of us to grow and

315
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,200
develop. We're cultivating something. We're not creating something.

316
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,358
And so, uh, and how do we cultivate and create the conditions that allows

317
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:25,440
something positive and useful to grow? And the the the um and that is um it

318
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:32,079
turns out we don't have to choose between changing the world and savoring

319
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:40,079
the world. We can savor changing the world.

320
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,599
They can be the one and the same thing to use the quote. But to say it in a

321
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:53,358
different way, we can care for ourselves. We can care for our life and enjoy our life at the

322
00:34:53,359 --> 00:35:00,480
same time. And how? When the efforts we make

323
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:07,839
to change are done wholesomely are done in a way that feels good, that

324
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:14,880
feels healthy, that feels heartwarming, that feels inspiring, feels nice to do

325
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,960
something rather than involve in change with greed, rather than being changed

326
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,720
with making change through hostility and animosity. rather than changing it uh

327
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:33,040
with a very heavy critical self- view like yeah I know I have to change I'm supposed to be more generous but I'm

328
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:40,400
such a lousy person and you know so I'll do my best but this is you know I'm pretty lousy and you know okay I'll do

329
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,079
it but that's not inspiring. So the idea is to

330
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:53,760
find ways in Buddhism to make changes to whatever change

331
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,839
you're going to do it in beautiful ways

332
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:07,680
and the word beautiful in the poly word kalana also means ethical.

333
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:14,720
So ethical and beauty are the same in Buddhism. wholesome. The word wholesome is also

334
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,800
kind of means ethical and beautiful or kind of synonyms for this. So how we do

335
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,640
the change is as in Buddhism is as important as the change we're going to

336
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:33,119
make. Don't give up the wholesome. always find what is the wholesome what is the

337
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:40,640
beautiful what's the ethical way to institute to instigate change

338
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:48,079
and what is the vision that we have in Buddhism the vision is also wholesome the vision

339
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:55,280
is also a vision that is beautiful that is ethical and that is uh really feels like it's

340
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,800
integrally part of the whole that's what wholesome means means in my

341
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:07,839
mind and how do we do all this? How do we have a theory of change in

342
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:14,320
Buddhism? How do we see what's going on clearly and and realistically? How do we have a

343
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:21,119
vision that's inspiring? And how do we go about doing knowing what is wholesome and beautiful?

344
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:29,119
This is one of the purposes of meditation is to uh is to practice regularly and

345
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:36,160
seriously enough that there starts to be a shift inside where the distractions of the mind, the

346
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,680
preoccupations of the mind, the judgments of the mind, the fears of the

347
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,920
mind, the greed and greeds of the mind, hostilities of the mind have all had a

348
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,599
chance to settle enough. They don't have to go away, but subtle enough that we

349
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,599
begin feeling and sensing there's much more here than this than the narrow

350
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,800
selective way in which we've seen our life up until that point. Too many

351
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,960
people live in a too narrow world through the lens of particular interpretations, ideas of who they are

352
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,400
and what the world is and what needs to happen. The function of meditation is to

353
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:23,440
relax that narrowness. So we start opening up wide the vision, the wider

354
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:31,040
sense of wholeness, the wider sense of what's possible with a vision that's cleared out of its selectivity, cleared

355
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:38,720
out of its bias, cleared out of its um preconceived ideas enough that we start

356
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,240
seeing and feeling and experiencing for ourselves

357
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:52,480
what's possible. So we clear the space so the sun of

358
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:59,599
awareness, the sun of life can shine on what is it that wants to

359
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:06,240
grow inside. And that's the in Buddhism is to really

360
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,079
do what's wholesome so the wholesome can grow. What is wholesome is waiting for

361
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:19,760
us. That's what there's deep inside there. The seed Buddhist idea is there's seeds inside that want to sprout and

362
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:26,640
want to grow and the right conditions what will grow are wholesome seeds.

363
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,480
If you're not careful you have also unh wholesome seeds inside.

364
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,560
And if you're not careful those are the seeds that you might sprout and might might grow.

365
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:45,200
And when that those grow sometimes in Buddhism, uh they're called uh vines.

366
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:52,160
And they have this idea that a vi a vine can take over and cover a tree to kill it.

367
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:59,440
So be careful what you grow. So a theory of change. What is your

368
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:07,040
theory of change? Do you have one? Is it a good one? Is it a helpful one? Is it

369
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,480
and and From the from the perspective of this talk today, does your theory of

370
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,400
change inspire you? Does it nourish you? Does it give you a

371
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,800
sense of inspiration to live a beautiful, ethical, and wholesome life?

372
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:31,119
And maybe as important, is your theory of change

373
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:38,640
one that's going to make this world that we live in a better place?

374
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:46,000
bringing peace and happiness, care, compassion to this world. And wouldn't it be

375
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,839
wonderful if these two visions, the vision you have for yourself, the vision you have for the world,

376
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:58,519
that uh are one and the same. They don't have to be any different.

377
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:07,440
So, theory of change. So, did I give you something to think about? That was my goal.

378
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,839
So uh so I'd encourage you to u talk to people about it and uh find friends and

379
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,960
strangers and say I'm supposed to talk about theory of change and my theory of

380
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,079
change would can we talk about this? I'd like to hear yours first

381
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:31,359
or something. So may you reflect on theory of change and in doing so I hope

382
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:37,720
all of us will change the world for a better place. Thank you.
