1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,860
okay welcome welcome folks

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,800
yeah good to see names streaming over there

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:22,939
um okay so we'll do what we do

4
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,880
um

5
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:38,880
so please uh settle into a posture that balances

6
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,899
relaxation alertness

7
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,640
and sometimes we try to establish mindfulness through

8
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,460
attention to an object a breath or sound or something

9
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,438
and sometimes it can be useful even before

10
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:58,079
identifying an object to establish mindfulness first what does

11
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,720
that mean for you

12
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:13,099
what needs to unwind in you to establish mindfulness

13
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,680
what do you need to make peace with to establish mindfulness

14
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:44,060
what images or words Inspire your heart

15
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,000
support the establishment of mindfulness

16
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,920
what ruminations do you have to have one more time

17
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:19,760
before you sense their dead end nature

18
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:39,680
what inspires your impulse to to know to understand

19
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,099
to be awake

20
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,740
and then as we establish some sense of presence

21
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:35,720
maybe the attention naturally can

22
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:41,240
embrace the object it doesn't feel like

23
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,900
squeezing the mind into some narrow slot

24
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,800
doesn't feel like putting toothpaste back in the

25
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,500
the tube

26
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,800
this natural

27
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,879
perhaps to sense the

28
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:15,020
sensations of your breathing

29
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:27,060
natural to notice the beginning [Music]

30
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,680
ending of the inhale

31
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,800
in the beginning ending of the exhale

32
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,740
and the release at the bottom of the exhale

33
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,839
kind of suspension in time okay

34
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,260
open

35
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,779
receptive

36
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,899
there's the way we direct our attention but then there's so much happening in

37
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:16,459
the meditating mind

38
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:24,019
ideas and Frameworks in the background

39
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:35,399
and sometimes we need gentleness gentle

40
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,300
thee in this forgiveness

41
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,519
that is mindfulness

42
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,660
we're giving samsara forgiving ourselves

43
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:11,060
and sometimes we need firmness

44
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:21,240
a reminder this thing I keep trying to do that I've tried to do

45
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:27,980
forever doesn't work foreign

46
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:41,779
ER into the breath

47
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,720
maybe it feels uh natural to

48
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,880
stay with the breathing or some uh

49
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,120
very defined object of attention

50
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,640
or maybe feel skillful to

51
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:12,080
open up to the entirety of the field of your experience

52
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,659
everything belonging

53
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,440
but nothing ownable

54
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:14,940
Maybe we

55
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:24,740
hallucinate the sense of the self

56
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:36,658
in order to govern Anita uncertainty

57
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:55,700
but it feels so good to let go

58
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,880
it feels so good to stop trying to make what

59
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,658
is uncertain certain

60
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,840
ungovernable in my control

61
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:53,539
to appreciate the centerlessness

62
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:03,260
of all phenomena foreign

63
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:11,539
what gets called me

64
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:18,799
my life my

65
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,200
foreign

66
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,898
foreign

67
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,220
okay

68
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,080
I see uh maybe uh Bell volume no volume

69
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:03,480
up my bell game is off um okay folks good to sit with you

70
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,820
um so

71
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:19,320
the the uh the the relaxation of Faith the

72
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:26,220
willingness of of Viria mindfulness this um

73
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:31,980
quiet uh impulse to know

74
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,799
certain kind of quiet hunger to know

75
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:43,500
faith effort mindfulness samadhi

76
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,980
the gathered mind unified mind

77
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:56,460
what's the the relationship between mindfulness and and samadhi

78
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:04,200
so it's often um distinguish by referencing the the uh

79
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:10,380
that kind of aperture of attention concentration is narrow just the tip of

80
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:18,679
the nose or something mindfulness is Broad but samadhi doesn't refer to

81
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:25,559
aperture it can be narrow or Broad tennis aerobic who says many people tell

82
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:32,039
us the Buddha taught two different types of meditation mindfulness meditation and concentration

83
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:38,760
meditation mindfulness meditation they say is the direct path concentration is the scenic route you take

84
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:45,240
at your own risk because it's easy to get caught there and you may never get out but when you actually look at what

85
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,960
the Buddha taught he never separates these two practices

86
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,600
mindfulness we could say

87
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,880
requires some measure of of concentration

88
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,940
mindfulness itself requires some measure of concentration otherwise we're getting

89
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:17,460
pinged around from memory to imaged you know to Future Body

90
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,500
Sensations we're glancing off the objects of

91
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,799
attention rather than the sustained soaking aiming and soaking aiming

92
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:35,460
penetrating in the the mahasi lineage

93
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,820
ajin sajito puts it uh differently of um

94
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:46,919
rather than than aiming and penetrating the object with attention

95
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:53,720
uh as pointing and then opening the hand

96
00:33:54,179 --> 00:34:01,740
and the opening of the hand is a kind of samadhi this sort of poised

97
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,840
receptivity even when we're doing quote unquote

98
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,158
mindfulness practice

99
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:20,520
shinzhen young defines mindfulness um as a three-fold skill set

100
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,740
working together sensory Clarity the sense of of uh

101
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:32,960
making discriminating a high level uh resolution on sensory phenomena

102
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,480
Equanimity this this non-contention with phenomena and concentration

103
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:46,280
somebody uh

104
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,520
attention attention is um is this spotlighting function

105
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:02,400
bringing something to mind Mata sikara and then we kind of brighten the object

106
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,160
with attentional light use that metaphor

107
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,740
and generally concentration samadhi deepens when the spotlight becomes

108
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:19,859
brighter and brighter steadier and steadier

109
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:27,660
there's less and less light escaping in other words the rest of phenomena are

110
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:36,380
unlit and we come to live in a much

111
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,900
smaller world a very pleasant world

112
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:49,980
much smaller and it's a

113
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:56,220
it's a capacity that supports the other Realms of of practice so

114
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:04,140
maybe we say samadhi is the the object of attention is fully satiating for the

115
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:12,920
mind there's no residual hunger for other stimulation

116
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,480
ordinarily we we think about samadhi as involving attention and it does

117
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:27,420
but a curious note that uh agencyto makes is uh that

118
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:33,380
in samadhi all the intentions are aligned

119
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:39,960
all the energies of the heart mind are moving in a single

120
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,020
direction that captures Something Beautiful about it

121
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:50,420
there's not a different impulses

122
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:55,700
banging into each other it's a state of non

123
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:03,960
ambivalence maybe we say and all the impulses to grasp and push

124
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:10,020
away all the ways we cope we just don't need to cope anymore we're not in

125
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:16,800
samadhi we're not coping with samsara in the same way

126
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:24,680
we're not Enchanted by samsara by phenomena in the same way

127
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:33,260
in so many of our efforts to so much of our thinking the kind of stories

128
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:40,440
narrativizing our life are these kind of thin attempts to cope

129
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:49,400
to Grapple the intensity of The Human Condition with the ungoverned ability of samsara

130
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:58,560
and uh this this settles out as the mind

131
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,820
gets very comfortable and so the hunger for sensory pleasure has faded away and

132
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:15,200
there's sort of like nothing to do but offer or attention

133
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,920
and this is uh revitalizing gives

134
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:28,260
yeah it gives us it's revitalizing in the sense that that it uh

135
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:34,859
we're secluded the heart can actually rest and Revitalize to meet the

136
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:42,119
intensity of life samadhi it has many functions in our

137
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:51,180
practice but one of them to my mind is Faith the first of the of the the five faculties it builds our faith

138
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:57,420
and it's this sense of as we start to maybe for the first time in our practice

139
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:03,660
get really settled it's like okay something's happening here

140
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:09,660
before it's like I don't know yeah I'm mindful yeah I'm trying to be careful

141
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:15,300
with my Sila my ethics yeah I'm maybe have learned some things but

142
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:21,420
Somalia like okay wow there's something this is not usual this is not ordinary

143
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:27,119
and that is um uh in invites us into a deeper kind

144
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,420
of Faith like the Buddha was talking about you you are not the exception to the

145
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:40,740
Buddha's rule and uh that's important because some part of us

146
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:46,500
pretty I think maybe deep into the past sometimes thinks that maybe this whole

147
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:53,160
Buddhist thing is another con of some kind

148
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:58,700
or it is promising way too much

149
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:05,640
and then as the Mind settles in it's like wow I don't know what this is but this is different and this path is

150
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:12,859
definitely something and I can do it I can do it

151
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,760
this is the the fruit really of of letting go of Letting Go not of

152
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,300
engineering um

153
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:33,780
and so we we can't really cling our way into Stillness

154
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:40,680
and if we try to cling our way back to Stillness it doesn't work

155
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:47,400
and there are stories Tales of people suffering enormously trying to uh

156
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:54,480
get concentrated or these things but um uh

157
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,599
this is a pleasure born of letting go

158
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:06,780
and so samadhi is kind of protected in the

159
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:11,420
sense that we cannot cling our way into it

160
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:19,338
so it's um reinforces and letting go

161
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:29,280
when we really gather when there's strong sense of of samadhi there's there's not a lot of learning happening

162
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,740
there are many other wholesome things happening but there's not a lot of learning happening

163
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:41,000
in the same way you you wouldn't learn about architecture by staring

164
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,380
unwaveringly at a small patch of concrete

165
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:53,220
yeah the image just came the Getty you know

166
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:59,160
the Getty and Los Angeles or something uh

167
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:04,320
the Grandeur of that but uh if we were just looking at a

168
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:09,680
patch of the foundation we wouldn't learn so much

169
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:17,720
and insight unfolds when the stability of samadhi is directed to

170
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:24,480
to understanding to understanding how experience is put together the

171
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:31,280
architecture of experience the architecture of self

172
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:41,700
savadi is um is the the quivering quality of mind I

173
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:49,200
associate it with a kind of yeah usually we use the word quivering for compassion but this is a different species of

174
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:56,660
quivering but very very receptive very porous very

175
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:01,740
impressionable very in other words fertile for learning

176
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:07,619
and so in the penumbra of samadhi where maybe there's very little

177
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:14,520
learning we start to become more attentive to a Nietzsche to

178
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:22,020
the architecture of experience and in that stability

179
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:29,640
the the learning the the the kind of mind is very fertile for learning and

180
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:36,900
the Dharma lessons that we uh we experience they make deeper

181
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:42,300
Impressions on the mind they make deeper Impressions on the mind

182
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:48,180
and so sometimes we have some some kind of insight or

183
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:54,720
excuse me understanding but what kind of legs does that Insight have

184
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:02,819
what kind of legs does it have how long does it last how long does it stay in our bones how long does the retreat we

185
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:09,359
sat stay in our bones how long does our understanding about

186
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:15,780
self love stay in our bones how long does our understanding about letting go

187
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:23,099
stay in our bones there's some evidence that exercise for

188
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:29,940
example enhances neuroplasticity the kind of the learning that happens in the

189
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:34,338
wake of cardiovascular exercise

190
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:44,040
may be the altered the kind of deeper learning more learning that happens

191
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:51,960
and if I had to guess I would say the same for samadhi samadhi

192
00:44:51,960 --> 00:45:00,540
um makes our mind brain more malleable what we've learned leaves

193
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:07,818
a deeper Mark has more legs when we learn it on somebody

194
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:16,640
so um offer this for your consideration and

195
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:24,599
pick up what CS Fall leave the rest behind and please know if this causes more

196
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,780
suffering for you uh

197
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:34,980
that's not what I meant to do yeah people have their own predilections

198
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:40,500
around samadhi some people they're just Glide path for them

199
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:49,140
and uh and most people have to uh grapple yeah self-included

200
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:56,520
um and so uh we keep going you know let me see what

201
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:03,960
the path offers us okay see you uh see you tomorrow wish you a

202
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,380
good day
