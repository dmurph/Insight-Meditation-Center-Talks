1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,240
good morning everybody um had a little uh glitches this morning I tried like

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:11,120
six times to go live on YouTube and every time I got a message saying this

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:18,600
message is PRI this this broadcast is private so so Kevin had to had to open a

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,000
kind of a third- party way of of uh accessing the the stream so I'm very

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,239
happy to be with you and I'm sorry you had to wait um and let's uh let's just let's sit

6
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,840
together you each of us in our separate places

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,000
all around the world but uh but together in this sa in

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,680
this sa that has become meaningful to so many people over the

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,920
years do I assuming you can hear me

10
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:06,000
you and

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:15,600
uh and see me I think uh I can see in the chat that things are going

12
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,640
okay

13
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,320
so once again you can

14
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:34,438
uh just uh pay attention a little bit of attention to the posture that ear

15
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,079
in let there be ease and

16
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,680
alertness looking around the body

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:59,200
for areas of tension that can be eased up opened relaxed a little bit

18
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,840
softened

19
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:24,080
let there be ease and this morning I invite you to uh

20
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,239
to begin with with this hearing again with hearing sounds and sounds

21
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:37,760
that that are present in where you are and any sounds

22
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:46,159
that that arise from from your device related to my voice

23
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:52,040
or maybe there are some notification beeps or rings coming through

24
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,120
from other programs that are want your

25
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,000
attention and uh knowing you can just hear

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,560
them without effort if you're if your ears and your your sensory apparatus is

27
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,920
working they're audible you don't have to reach out in

28
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,200
any way in order to hear the sounds they come to

29
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:31,319
you so to welcome them

30
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,439
and then notice that they they go they pass

31
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:47,120
away they can be received in our awareness it

32
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:57,079
sounds I can hear the sound of the the fan of my

33
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:05,000
computer it's a very fing it's pretty

34
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,519
constant occasional sounds from

35
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:21,959
outside other appliances making their little thingss they come and they

36
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:31,600
go sometimes they persist and sometimes they're just momentary and all of them can just be

37
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,199
received just received

38
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,759
and the same is true for the sensations of breathing

39
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,400
often when we're meditating there there can be a sense that breathing is an

40
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,319
intentional action that we're causing it to happen

41
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,440
and and you know I think quite a few meditators have a a habit of controlling

42
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:58,800
the breath often even unconsciously when we when we meditate

43
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:08,360
but you know the breath will continue if we leave it alone when we leave it

44
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,400
alone it's not going to

45
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:22,400
stop we don't have to do anything in order for breathing to happen the

46
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,919
body breathes every minute of every day that we're alive

47
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:43,479
and we can just let it happen we can be receptive to the sensations knowing it's

48
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,400
happening without interfering just as we don't need to interfere with the sounds

49
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,759
that we hear

50
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,160
there's no need to reach out with a

51
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,919
mind just allow whatever is arising in you the sensations of

52
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,560
breathing any sounds that might be

53
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:57,280
arising any thoughts emotions whatever is arising within you

54
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:10,440
just let it be known as it arises and as it persists if it

55
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,520
does and then noticing as it goes

56
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:32,520
away each sensation each breath each sound that has its little

57
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,800
life and then it's gone

58
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:26,480
and if we can be receptive like this open to all that's arising

59
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,120
then all that's making up our life right now and just come to

60
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,040
us come to us in its fullness

61
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:16,120
all the experience that makes up our life and it can it can be known there as

62
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,360
a flow just a moving flow and we we can

63
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,000
come to know it very simply not interfering not trying to fix anything

64
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,440
just sitting and receiving all the things that make up our

65
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:43,920
life each moment can be fresh new and still very

66
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
simple

67
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

68
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240

e e

78
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:17,798
and you might just uh just check your inner State the state of your mind

79
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:24,400
heart is there a leaning forward a a trying to

80
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,480
catch experience catch the breath or sounds or

81
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:38,200
whatever is arising you can let go if there's anything like that any kind

82
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,799
of um grasping

83
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,679
or trying to get hold of experience and just allow it to come to

84
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:53,679
you

85
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:09,120
your awareness can receive what arises can be known without any leaning

86
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,520
forward just

87
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760

[Music]

102
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
for e

103
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:10,880
oh I remembered to unmute after I had my sip of

104
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,799
tea um today is uh is is day four now of

105
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:23,399
our investigation of this list of six qualities of the

106
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:29,600
Dharma um this list uh you know it occurs in quite a number of sutas in uh

107
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:36,000
in several of the of the collections of the nikayas of the early

108
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:43,399
discourses it's not a it's not a teaching that only only occurs once or

109
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:49,519
twice so we've looked at four of these six qualities the first is that the

110
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,600
Dharma is well proclaimed it's a useful body of

111
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:00,519
teachings it's able to guide us from the beginning of our practice all the way to

112
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:07,679
full Awakening and the second uh quality is that it's visible here and now we see

113
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:14,159
it in our experience as it happens in the moment isn't theoretical it's not

114
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,919
found in books and Dharma talks but in our practice as we walk the

115
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:26,399
path and the third is that the Dharma is immediately

116
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:33,159
effective when we practice practice in a dhic way we can see that it works and

117
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:40,799
the fourth is that it's inviting inspections aaso we're invited to come to the Dharma

118
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:47,039
to practice it to see for ourselves whether it works how it works and to

119
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:53,159
keep looking keep exploring and then the fifth quality uh

120
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:59,039
the one I'll talk about today is uh opao on W

121
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:06,000
leading and uh I think this really follows uh logically from the previous

122
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,200
ones when we've come to see for ourselves how the Dharma works to see

123
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,960
its effective it's its Effectiveness in us you know here and now

124
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:24,279
immediately then we can then we see that we can uh we can trust the direction in

125
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:29,640
which it's leading us onward toward Freedom toward the end of greed and

126
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:37,200
hatred and delusion and when we see these qualities of the Dharma for ourselves see them

127
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:44,320
playing out in our own experience we know empirically that the path works and

128
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:51,039
I believe that uh as a result of that we practice it more

129
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,880
diligently we're inspired perhaps I know certainly I am

130
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:05,840
and uh to use the pebble in the shoe analogy that I once heard Gil use once

131
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,880
we've seen the effect of taking a pebble out of our shoe then we're likely uh

132
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:19,320
probably to to take it out more quickly the next time there's one in there um and after a while it kind of

133
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:25,640
becomes automatic you know we might even Shake our shoes out um if we've been walking around outside in fly areas

134
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,919
before we put them on again we might walk in a way that's less likely to

135
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:37,240
result in Pebbles getting into our shoes we might avoid pebbly areas not wear

136
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,039
sandals perhaps in pebbly areas there are a lot of ways to uh skillful ways to

137
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:49,440
avoid Pebbles and when we see that our Dharma practice is effective when our

138
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,840
inspection shows us that we we have more peace in our hearts and Minds that we

139
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:02,360
are Kinder wiser less reactive Ive we are LED onward we naturally begin to act

140
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:09,720
in ways that avoid putting uh Pebbles into our hearts and and

141
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:16,440
minds I think uh our understanding of the ways that

142
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:23,960
our mind works um uh deepens and we begin to have uh to

143
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:30,519
bring more discernment into uh decisions about how we we spend our time our free

144
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:35,760
time our work time even how where we spend our money how we interact with

145
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,919
with others the quality of our interactions we develop more wisdom

146
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:47,200
about avoiding activities like pebbles you know or people that lead us into uh

147
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,880
into more Dua our hearts get bigger they get more

148
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,919
welcoming more and more we make choices that are based on Discerning what is SK

149
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:04,120
skillful what's beneficial what's kind as opposed to what leads to harm both

150
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:10,440
harm for ourselves and harm for others we keep using the tools of the Dharma

151
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:16,039
mindfulness compassion Good Will ethical Behavior

152
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:22,039
generosity and we experience the results and that keeps us leading uh going

153
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:29,840
onward it's leading us onward ultimately ultimately to uh to

154
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,279
freedom and there's a slightly different translation of this Pow

155
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:43,120
opo with it and it's inward leading as opposed to onward leading and uh and I I

156
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,840
appreciate that I appreciate these the both of them my sense is that this inward movement points to the Dharma

157
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:57,440
being found within us you know there is something within us that recognizes and

158
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:05,039
responds responds to our practice and our study of the Dharma also by aligning with the Dharma in an

159
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:11,519
intuitive way there's something within us it is the Dharma I think our inner

160
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,720
life uh comes to express the Dharma more and more as we continue to practice the

161
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,799
Dharma has become visible to us we see it we see it we begin to see it

162
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:30,320
everywhere think you know sometimes we talk about us uh looking at life through a Dharma

163
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:37,000
lens um but my sense is that the Dharma lens is not something that we put on

164
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,600
like a pair of glasses it's the actual way we see the world Looking Through The Eyes of our

165
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:50,519
heart maybe our our our whole being through a mind that's developed Clarity

166
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:57,840
and discernment and care for others we're in the Dharma stream in the

167
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,158
D Dharma stream is in us and we see the world through

168
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,919
that and uh there's a capacity listed in in the essay that I've been referencing

169
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:19,000
about performative literacy and I'll put a link to um to uh where that essay can

170
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,839
be found on the web in the chat uh at some point because someone asked about it yesterday and there might be some of

171
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:33,839
you who are interested in it um I think this uh uh I think all these

172
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:42,118
are really they're really relevant uh to you know our Dharma practice and this one I think really um really uh goes

173
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:48,720
along with h with the uh aspect of the Dharma being onward leading and it is a

174
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,560
tolerance for ambiguity for Paradox for

175
00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:00,839
uncertainty I love this suggestion because I think sometimes Dharma teachings are ambiguous

176
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:06,200
they are kind of paradoxical for example the middle way

177
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:12,040
you know the M often we talk about the middle way is being uh neither driven by

178
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:18,960
sense desires nor driven by aestheticism you know somewhere somewhere in the middle and that's one way of defining it

179
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:27,839
and it that's not ambiguous or paradoxical that's just balanced but the middle way can also refer to ideas and

180
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,680
concepts related to being you know to identifying with a self and as you're

181
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:40,079
probably aware the Buddha wouldn't answer when people asked him is there a

182
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:47,000
self he argued against those who were uh eternalists claiming a permanent

183
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,839
existence for self or for anything else that exists and those who were

184
00:35:52,839 --> 00:36:01,800
annihilationist who claimed that nothing really exists the alternative to the these extremes that that everything

185
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,040
exists eternally or that and there's a self that exists eternally and that or

186
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,560
that nothing exists at all was said to be teaching by

187
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,920
the middle teaching by the middle things arise due to conditions and they cease

188
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:25,560
when those conditions no longer exist the Buddha said for those who see

189
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:32,680
arising there can't be a aism and for those who see passing there can't be

190
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:41,160
eternalism neither one nor the other does the self exist it depends the teaching the Buddha

191
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,760
teaches by the middle so you know being willing to not

192
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:52,359
come down on one side or the other we rest in a kind of uncertainty you know

193
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:59,839
it depends things depend when we solidly identify around a when we solidify kind

194
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:05,760
of around a a concept like the existence or non-existence of a self then we we

195
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,680
put a block in that natural flow of the Dharma the flow that is leading us

196
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:18,960
onward it's the flow of life you know we aren't seeing the onward leading nature of the Dharma when we're trying to pin

197
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:25,680
it down to fix it in place the quality of inviting inspection also plays its

198
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,880
part in this you know we come we come again and again we come and see for ourselves we don't need to come to a

199
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,480
conclusion we keep looking wisdom comes as a result of

200
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,560
keeping looking so this quality of mind being tolerant of uncertainty it allows us to

201
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:51,079
let go of a desire for final truths you know for some ultimate description of

202
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:56,560
reality or of the purpose of human existence and some definitive answer to

203
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:04,400
the question who am I and uh you know I think uh as far as

204
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:12,400
I've been able to tell um this the humans have always had a desire for firm

205
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,839
answers to questions like this like you know what is the purpose of life you

206
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:25,599
know what's uh what when did the universe begin you know

207
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:32,000
there if we can't hand questions like that I think it it's

208
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,200
um you know it leaves us in a state that where we want the answers but it's

209
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:44,119
really s it's really simple uh excuse me it's not simple it's really it's similar

210
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:49,960
it's really similar to um the the uh the

211
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:55,880
situation I brought up yesterday um talking about how um Sheridan Blau

212
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:05,480
actually was the other day a couple days ago there were shared and Blau said that students who aren't able to um uh

213
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:11,200
understand a te a difficult text the first time they read it they think that they're not Advanced enough to to know

214
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,800
the answer they think they they can't uh they can't read but actually it's it's

215
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:24,599
not because of that it's just because sometimes there aren't answers to uh to

216
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:31,280
these questions I'm times we think because we can't figure out what's the purpose of

217
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:38,560
life that it's because we're not philosophically sophisticated enough um

218
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:44,079
but the Buddha often refus to answer philosophical questions you know does

219
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:52,119
does does having an answer lead to the end of suffering you know is it practical to have an

220
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:59,599
answer what's useful is knowing the answers to the questions that lead to the end is

221
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:08,319
suffering sometimes things need to stay mysterious you know when the when the

222
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:14,240
Zen monk who was sweeping the courtyard um was asked uh who are

223
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:21,640
you he replied that he was sweeping sweeping humans like certainty

224
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:28,599
you know it makes us feel safe but the Dharma is pointing towards becoming comfortable with un uncertainty

225
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:36,599
comfortable with uh with Paradox with inconsistency with inconstancy with

226
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:42,000
change there's that fourth quality of the Dharma the one I talked about yesterday

227
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,359
aaso inviting inspection come and see for yourself keeping the door open

228
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:55,240
keeping looking and connected to this tolerance for ambiguity is a willingness to change

229
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:00,280
our minds to engage with different visions of the Dharma and to keep our

230
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:08,160
interest and uh and uh our curiosity fresh to not come to conclusions it's

231
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,599
really essential I think uh to be willing to change our minds as a result of what we're coming to see in our

232
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:19,680
practice to accept that we might be wrong about something and to see that

233
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,800
it's not really a problem it's just part of walking the path discovering more as

234
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,280
we go we uh we can engage with uh people who

235
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:38,000
have different views you know and come to appreciate those views come to see the logic and the usefulness of them

236
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:45,359
without necessarily even taking them on just keeping our minds open to other

237
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:52,400
possibilities in uh in his essay uh Blau mentions methodological believing and

238
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,079
doubting these are two ways of engaging with ideas that we come in contact with

239
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,000
we can try an idea on for size you know for many of us probably early early in

240
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,960
our practice we were just kind of giving it a chance seeing where it might lead having a kind of tentative Faith

241
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,240
practicing believing as an experiment and then on the other side

242
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,520
there's methodological doubting we can ask ourselves what if my views about

243
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:29,400
this are wrong being willing to question our own views and perceptions to ask what if I'm

244
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,839
wrong about this what are the implications of that just looking deeper

245
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:40,359
for me um I think of this in terms of rebirth you know at at present I don't

246
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:46,240
subscribe to the idea of rebirth I don't have direct experience of it for sure in

247
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:53,400
this lifetime and I sort of subscribe to the idea that you know it's probably just a

248
00:42:53,400 --> 00:43:01,400
a hold over from views that that were prevalent in India during the Buddhist time it doesn't seem useful to me in the

249
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:07,720
context of ending suffering in this lifetime but you know many teachers who

250
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,839
I respect who I respect a lot they do subscribe to it you know and maybe I'm

251
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:17,920
wrong maybe I'm completely wrong maybe it's true and what would that mean to

252
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,079
investigate that what are ways that trying on that belief would be useful in

253
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:27,400
ending ending my suffering

254
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,720
an open mind a mind that is still curious and tolerant of not

255
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:40,240
knowing um maybe even uh really enjoying not knowing keeping ourselves ready to

256
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:46,000
learn something new from our lives as each day unfolds you know while

257
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,240
following the compass of our hearts and Minds that are more and more clearly uh

258
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,200
keeping us in the current of the Dharma there's that onward leading stream or

259
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:05,880
just moving into the stream that's how I want to practice that's how I want to live my life keeping beginners mind

260
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:13,079
don't know mind along with the faith in the Dharma that uh that grows as our

261
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:18,440
minds you know gradually incline more and more in the direction of actions and

262
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:28,920
mind States and attitudes that arise out of goodwi and wisdom opo onward

263
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:36,800
leading so I went a little over today and uh I thank you very much for

264
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,240
your attention and tomorrow we'll talk about the last of these qualities of the

265
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,200
Dharma and I hope uh I think I'll try to get on YouTube way early and

266
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:55,119
see hopefully it'll work uh without uh having to get Kevin to help me but I'm

267
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:01,640
very grateful for his help so thank oh I'm going to put the I'm going to put the uh the link in the chat right now

268
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:08,359
it's a let's see if I can copy and paste

269
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:27,359
it yes it went in so

270
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:36,280
hopefully you'll be able to use that it's a really I think it's a really useful essay so um blessings to all of

271
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,839
you and I'll see you tomorrow
