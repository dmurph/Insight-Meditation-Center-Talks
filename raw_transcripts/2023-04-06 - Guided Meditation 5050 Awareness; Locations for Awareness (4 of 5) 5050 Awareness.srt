1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:08,278
so hello everyone welcome and

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,519
sometimes I think of mindfulness practice as having adventures with

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,539
awareness and that uh

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,039
life is very different when we're aware so much so that sometimes I think of we

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:33,360
have you know many bodies the body we have and we're not aware and then the bodies we have

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:41,399
when we're aware just all these different ways of experiencing the body and um the mind that's when we're not

7
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,660
aware and the mind that's aware which is so fascinating and the the emotions and what we're aware

8
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,000
and when we're not aware our social life when we're aware and

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,360
when we're not mindful it's so varied and become so rich when the mindfulness

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,019
is there the awareness is there and it becomes so variable

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,479
um it becomes almost like three-dimensionalers four-dimensional or something

12
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,659
um when there's a clear sense of mindfulness and without clear mindfulness and

13
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,720
kind of uh almost intentional mindfulness or awareness

14
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,900
life can start becoming two-dimensional or one-dimensional

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,500
so the um one of their great skills that I've

16
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,560
found very useful for me is being able to sometimes almost

17
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,259
simultaneously be aware of others and myself if I'm in conversation

18
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,780
with people and I like to have this general idea that I'm 50 of my attention is with the

19
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,860
others and 50 attention is here with this person with myself and um and that's why there's a

20
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:10,800
wonderful balance and there's a check and balance system and so this ability to shift where we

21
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,140
bring our attention to be able to get a richer uh experience

22
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,900
of what's actually happening here uh it can can be involved in any given

23
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,300
moment of mindfulness that we can be aware of an object of

24
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,540
attention and we can be aware of How It's what it's like to be aware of the object of

25
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:40,200
attention so I can be aware of my breathing and I can be aware of how I am being

26
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,440
aware of the breathing that I'm that I'm straining or pushing or lackadaisical or

27
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:55,379
lazy or resistant I can be aware that of how uh I'm aware

28
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:00,480
of it you know that I'm aware of an emotion and I can be aware of where I'm

29
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,280
aware from where I'm aware of it am I aware of it in my head my way with my body uh which of these two is a useful

30
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,739
way of taking in and registering the emotion and um so sometimes I'm with the

31
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:19,680
emotions sometimes I'm with how I am taking it in oh it's in that place in my body my

32
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,280
place and body feels this way and this is my reaction to it my response to it

33
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,140
and so for this meditation I'd like to suggest that there'd be a very simple alternation for you

34
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:40,260
maybe almost with the alternation of breathing between being aware of something

35
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,680
and then being aware of how it is for you to be aware of it what's it what's a subjective experience

36
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:53,400
like for you to be engaged in the mindfulness of something so to clearly see something in its own

37
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:00,360
right and how then then how is it like to be aware of it and this adventure of kind

38
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:07,500
of going back and forth not one or the other if it's only how you are about it the

39
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,860
subjective experience which is one extreme that some people take then it's all living inside of this kind of

40
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,560
Labyrinth of self and me and the the impact and what I should do and

41
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,919
you know and judgments about it but if it's all about the object then

42
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,820
there can be losing touch with oneself there can be a strain there can be

43
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:39,000
attitudes about the object that go unseen but to go back and forth to see both

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,940
sometimes to be seemingly simultaneously sometimes by kind of back and forth

45
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:51,000
so to begin

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,759
with the meditation posture

47
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,319
and then gently closing the eyes

48
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:27,080
and mindfulness awareness practice begins with doing so intentionally

49
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,639
doing so knowingly

50
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,539
consciously

51
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:46,740
choosing to be aware and to begin by choosing to be aware of

52
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,220
your body

53
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,979
and taking some time to feel your body familiarize yourself with your

54
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,160
body

55
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:21,199
and then how are you being aware of your body are the judgments fears

56
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,199
resistance ideas

57
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,819
might it be possible to

58
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,759
simplify how you are being aware just aware of

59
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,120
the body

60
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,380
and then to become aware of your body breathing

61
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:12,560
familiarize yourself with how breathing is at this time

62
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,460
and then how are you in being aware of breathing

63
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:04,280
do you have judgments ideas of what should be and shouldn't be

64
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,880
do you have expectations and things you're trying to do with your breathing

65
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,080
is there fear is there

66
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,800
concerns about breathing is there enthusiasm

67
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,719
how is it how are you about your breathing

68
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:44,219
and can you simplify how you are

69
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:49,680
with mindfulness of breathing so it's simply being aware of the body

70
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,220
breathing

71
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,019
and then gently

72
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:29,100
going back and forth between how you are in being aware of breathing

73
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:36,860
and the breathing take a few long slow deep breaths

74
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:41,300
relaxing as you exhale

75
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,540
and then letting your breathing return to normal

76
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,920
and then continuing quietly with the meditation

77
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,320
but in some relaxed rhythm

78
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:18,019
move back and forth between what you're clearly mindful of

79
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,519
a sense of choice to be aware and

80
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,880
intentional about it and then

81
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:36,180
becoming aware of the subjective experience of what it's like to be aware

82
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,560
how are you being aware

83
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,200
it may be moving back and forth with these two modes

84
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,600
can be done in a way that's quieting

85
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:02,240
stealing calming here

86
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,860
and as we come to the end of the sitting

87
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,880
who first check in with how you are

88
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:49,760
how are you and your body and how my things have shifted for you

89
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,580
how are you in your mind

90
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:04,700
and how my things have shifted for you

91
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,778
how are you emotionally

92
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,919
now how might that have shifted from the beginning of the meditation

93
00:26:51,059 --> 00:27:00,059
and then with how you are what if what's available inside of you

94
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:05,360
for kindness for Goodwill

95
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,019
for compassion

96
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:17,880
and how Now to turn your attention to the people of your lives the people you

97
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,860
might see today encounter today

98
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,779
and to consider them to think of them

99
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:41,240
kindly with friendship Goodwill

100
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:48,440
have thoughts of appreciation for them

101
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,039
maybe being aware of

102
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:05,880
appreciating that you can have this ability to appreciate others

103
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:12,020
to enjoy others to care for others

104
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:21,740
and then in whatever way that you have benefited from this meditation

105
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,059
Maybe you can

106
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:35,640
want to use that benefit

107
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:43,260
to benefit others use that benefit of meditation

108
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:51,179
to enter into the world caringly kindly

109
00:28:51,840 --> 00:29:00,500
with warmth and friendship for others even if they are not that in return

110
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:12,600
may we go forth from meditation for the welfare and happiness of others

111
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:21,799
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

112
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,820
may all beings

113
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:35,480
be peaceful and may all beings be free

114
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:48,260
and may we contribute even in small ways to that possibility

115
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,119
[Music]

116
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,600
thank you

117
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,679
so hello and uh

118
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:23,100
welcome to this fourth talk on on the shifting perspectives for

119
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:30,360
awareness or locations for awareness we could ask you know different places

120
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,620
for from which we're aware we could also ask

121
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:41,640
different locations for what where awareness lands what the focus of

122
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:47,220
awareness is and we have some Choice around that and

123
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:53,399
a lot of what the emphasis this week is they use your capacity to for choice and discernment

124
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:58,860
to become wise about how to use attention

125
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:05,100
and to begin feeling you have some agency and engagement with how you're

126
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:10,740
aware so you're aware and effective in a useful way

127
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:17,520
and this is becomes you know the overall overarching kind of theme since the beginning of the year has been how to

128
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:24,840
work with challenges and um and the um

129
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:30,600
and this is an actually an important part challenges of all kinds are challenging

130
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:36,059
and because of that we tend to be swept into them or focused on them or

131
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:42,260
but it could also we can we can be very impacted by them and they can be difficult emotionally

132
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:47,580
physically psychologically and we get wrapped up in that in our

133
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:55,320
reactivity to them and the impact it has on them but these uh challenges we have

134
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:02,220
will have uh will be less vulnerable or more or less kind of um

135
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:09,720
impacted in a negative way if we are engaged in being aware if we

136
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,240
are kind of navigating swimming in the waters rather than just floating and

137
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,299
letting whatever waves come kind of wash over us we're also swimming in the ocean

138
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:27,240
of change and the world and we're kind of adjusting ourselves according to the

139
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,460
situation so we have some agency some engagement and just the very engagement

140
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:39,240
of being a whip of exploring how to be mindful is a kind of a protection

141
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:45,720
from just being too open and too receptive to be impacted by everything

142
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:52,740
we're still feeling things deeply but we're not uh as vulnerable for it

143
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:59,940
all if we have some sense of Engagement we have something to do we're

144
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:08,339
not a helpless and hopeless in a situation so um so one of the things that's uh

145
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:16,618
very useful to do with awareness practice or with awareness is um when we're in social situations or

146
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:24,300
in the world especially is to have 50 of the attention on

147
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:30,780
the people we're with the social situation we're in and 50 of the tension on oneself

148
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:36,240
this is not an exact number 50 50 but just kind of like approximately half and half

149
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:43,440
and uh and the idea is to go back and forth or to be aware of both at the same time

150
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:50,398
and um and if we do only aware of the other person then we're not aware of the impact the

151
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:56,700
situation has we're not aware of our attitudes and judgments that are coming up we're not aware of

152
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:03,380
um uh our responses and our intuitions and all these things

153
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,180
and but if we're only aware of ourselves then we're not really taking in all the

154
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:16,680
information of the other person about listening really well we're not you know a lot of communication is non-verbal and

155
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:22,380
so if we're not really there to pay attention we don't pick up the non-verbal cues of what's going on in

156
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,960
the conversation and um so to go back and forth and be

157
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,619
aware of both brings us into a nice balance uh if we're paying attention to ourselves we might notice something like

158
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:41,460
we're not paying attention we're not listening and that's pretty you know dramatic we might also notice that we're

159
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:48,119
having judgments so we're starting to plan what we're going to say next we might also see that we are impacted

160
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:53,700
by what's being said and now we're swimming in the in the our the impact

161
00:35:53,700 --> 00:36:00,720
and uh maybe we're crumbling under it or getting tense around it or or getting

162
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,240
assertive and you know and feeling angry all this information is useful

163
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:13,320
because that comes into play but in the act of communication the act of kind of exchange with people and it's good to be

164
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:20,640
a knowledge about it to know it also by being aware of ourselves in some

165
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:26,700
higher quality way we have access to a much greater set of information about

166
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:32,099
what's happening in the exchange with other people are are psychophysical I'd like to think

167
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:38,220
of our psychophysical body as being an antenna or many antennas

168
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:44,280
we have amazing capacities for sensing and feeling and receiving information

169
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,800
from the world around us much of it which people don't Avail themselves to

170
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,500
and uh and so to really begin taking that in by being present to oneself

171
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:01,920
we're not just aware of ourselves it's not like self-focused we're aware of uh

172
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,680
we're much more present for all the sense apparati all the ways in which

173
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,619
we're taking information and responding and and mirroring the person and all kinds of things

174
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:18,720
so it's not so much that we're paying attention to ourselves with emphasis on self

175
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,260
we're paying we're here 50 percent here in this body in this

176
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:30,480
psychophysical system that we happen to be in in order to really take in what's

177
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,300
happening in some deeper way so we're actually better able to pay

178
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:42,540
attention to others and know people through this kind of being grounded in oneself

179
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:49,020
by being grounded in other people though we we start we are able to take in more information and we understand them

180
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:56,820
better and and we offer our kindness I mean paying attention well to other people is a kind thing

181
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,859
the 50 50 division of of attention actually can

182
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:09,599
make us better listeners the people being listened to might think that you're really present in a full way

183
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,180
uh but uh and they feel it because you are the heightened awareness the

184
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:22,680
heightened listening I can heightened attentiveness when you can also be present for 50 here in your experience

185
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:28,380
as I said because of all these different ways that we're attending we're aware of

186
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:33,839
our posture and posture says a lot about how we're with some other people and if you're

187
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:39,359
aware of your posture then maybe you would adjust it in a way that you're more connected to what's happening

188
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:46,200
rather than turning towards the door or ready to leave so one of the choices then we have about

189
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:53,940
mindfulness and awareness is where is our attention and to be attract

190
00:38:53,940 --> 00:39:01,500
that oh it's mostly with a person of being pulled in and um and one of the places to kind of

191
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:08,460
start experimenting with with this is if someone's telling a wonderful story or a wonderful joke or or you're listening to

192
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:14,280
a wonderfully engaging speaker and you're getting pulled into the story of the idea

193
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:22,500
uh to be to then to kind of how does that feel to lose touch with yourself and be absorbed in what's going on

194
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:28,680
um if you're really angry with someone are you absorbed in them as the object

195
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:36,240
of your of blame and are you losing touch with yourself and how to come back into balance is 50

196
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,420
50. and how to take care of yourself so that you can be a better companion a

197
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:49,680
better listener better participant in whatever situation you're in so we have some choice

198
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,380
about where we put our attention and then how we're aware

199
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:01,260
and when we're bringing the attention to ourselves we can Are we more

200
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:06,839
experiencing all this in the body and feeling the feelings we're centered in

201
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:13,500
the feelings of how it feels to be with the other person hear what's being said and they're internally we're reacting to

202
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,720
our feelings that's one way it's a it's a good way at times

203
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,380
and or am I more in my thoughts and planning what I'm going to say and reacting and reflecting what the

204
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:32,460
person's saying that's good sometimes but both of these ways sometimes has their their weaknesses to them and is

205
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:38,880
this really the best way to be with the situation and maybe we should shift or back and

206
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,400
forth and these kinds of kind of Engagement with it

207
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:51,480
um is a kind of protection from getting uh overwhelmed or being

208
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:58,500
too impacted by what the situation they're going on uh there's no not as much room in us to

209
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:05,700
be overwhelmed if we're engaged in a you know in a intentional clear way we

210
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:11,099
um what's what's going on and um

211
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:18,119
so this attention 50 to 50 back and forth and um

212
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:25,200
and um the beautiful thing that can happen is that uh

213
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,420
um it's possible to be very aware of what's happening in the body what's

214
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:37,320
happening in thoughts what's happening in feelings and all this and very aware of the other person

215
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:44,240
and somehow The self-concern Falls away the

216
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,220
self-preoccupation the the self-definition the self kind of self

217
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:55,800
thing that we're so often caught in can fall away so that it's almost like we're

218
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:03,180
not there but for a very pre but there's a lot of presence we're not there but we're not checked

219
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:09,060
out we're acutely sensitive to what's happening in this psychophysical body so

220
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:16,619
we're responsible and caring and and involved but this ego and and uh and

221
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:22,320
self kind of coagulation around self can relax and Fall Away

222
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:28,079
as we engage in this kind of full attention and this whole attention is partly

223
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:34,800
defined by this this half with the other person or the situation and half for ourselves

224
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,619
so I would encourage you to today to look for situations where it might not

225
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:51,359
be too complicated or difficult to do this kind of work back and forth and um and uh maybe uh

226
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:57,540
you're listening to some you know a lecture being talk talked or something maybe you're even listening to this one

227
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:02,760
the YouTube or maybe to me or maybe you

228
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:08,160
listening to a podcast or something so it's kind of a safe place and then kind

229
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:15,380
of have a nice rhythm of going back and forth listening and then how does it feel what's how are you as a listener

230
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:21,720
listening and how are you um or maybe there are certain friends that you can make sense to do this

231
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:27,800
you're going for a walk with them and that's a great place to kind of do do both

232
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:34,859
so um um you have an amazing capacity to be

233
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:40,200
aware and awareness is multifaceted many ways of being aware

234
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:47,760
and uh that's a very rich life to be able to kind of find your way and

235
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:54,300
have choice and navigate the different ways that we're aware for the benefit of ourselves and the

236
00:43:54,300 --> 00:44:00,060
benefit of others so thank you and um I look forward to

237
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:03,680
the last talk in the series tomorrow
