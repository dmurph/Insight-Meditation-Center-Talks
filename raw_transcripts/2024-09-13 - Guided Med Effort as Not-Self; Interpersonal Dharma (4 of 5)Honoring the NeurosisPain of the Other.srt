1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:06,759
so welcome uh welcome all uh good morning

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:13,719
to most but I know Switzerland is in the house

3
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:19,080
so late afternoon I think

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:28,960
um yeah lovely to see uh See the names all right uh that's uh that's

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
it

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,960
e e

7
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:40,439
maybe uh for this first minute uh just uh

8
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,119
don't don't do

9
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:58,439
anything in a sense see how many things you might stop doing how many things you

10
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,520
think meditation asked you to start

11
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:22,000
doing whatever consciously can be stopped just

12
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,840
stop

13
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,840
e e

14
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:41,959
it's a certain kind of confidence that

15
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:56,120
uh freedom is on offer that there's already goodness

16
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,360
here that it's not the self self and the self

17
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,159
efforting that uh claws its way to

18
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Freedom for

19
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,800
sometimes our doing our effort Our intention our

20
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,280
direction of

21
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,240
attention all of this actually crystallizes the sense of

22
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,240
self

23
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,080
sense of the meditator pulling the strings behind the

24
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,080
scene

25
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,560
and so we experiment with that

26
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:26,680
relaxing relaxing all the conscious impulses to do

27
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,360
something rather than to trust

28
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
something

29
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
e

30
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

31
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

32
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

33
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
e e

34
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:19,360
if there's something you can't stop doing that's okay don't double down and

35
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,760
try to stop what you cannot stop

36
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:48,560
just practice relaxing the Deep

37
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,120
impulse of doing

38
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
performing

39
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

40
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

41
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
e e

42
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:36,600
now that let us uh practice doing something but almost like with the

43
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:44,000
spirit of non-doing doing something but somehow

44
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,000
doing it in a different way than we've tended to do

45
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,959
it somehow

46
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:10,639
not repeating that kind of subtly desperate

47
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,800
energy of uh doing

48
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:24,569
this but instead very [Music]

49
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:32,079
openly receiving your breathing e

50
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:29,759
don't congeal sense of you the meditator

51
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,120
behind that receptivity just

52
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:48,440
receive this beautiful rhythmic flow of our

53
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
breathing

54
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

55
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

56
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

57
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

58
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

59
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

60
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

61
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
e e

62
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,480
we're care careful not to Source our meditation

63
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,039
instructions from

64
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:16,039
places voices within us that are impatient

65
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:19,039
unwise

66
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:30,120
moralistic we're not letting the super ego do our meditation

67
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:39,039
that's not the headquarters but we instead Source our

68
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,400
counsel and motivation from something deeper in us

69
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,760
more intuitive and

70
00:21:53,679 --> 00:22:00,520
embodied and so it's safe to ignore every voice

71
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:08,120
place that's harshly

72
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,679
critical or full of

73
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:21,120
self or full of compulsivity doing

74
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,559
this we just find the threat of our practice

75
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
elsewhere

76
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

77
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

78
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

79
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

80
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

81
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

82
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

83
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

84
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

85
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

86
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
e e

87
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
for e

88
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,919
okay so we'll uh continue on with this uh interpersonal

89
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:22,679
theme and today is something like honoring

90
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:29,960
honoring Neurosis the Neurosis of the other honoring Duca

91
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,919
suffering so sometimes I've I've had the thought

92
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:42,720
just did a a retreat on the four noble truths with uh friend and colleague uh

93
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,840
inz Freedman IRC and we did the four noble truths but

94
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:55,559
sometimes I've thought the first Noble Truth sort of contains the other

95
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:01,679
three you know the truth of of suffering cause you know that there's a cessation

96
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,480
of the cause and there's a path but the first truth you know the

97
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,600
truth of of uh dukka uh usually rendered a

98
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,720
suffering that is no joke like and we

99
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:24,480
may say uh yeah I get I know suffering everyone

100
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:31,960
knows suffering that's why we're here it's why we're practicing and I've suffered and you've suffered

101
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:39,440
and yeah we know it but do we comprehend it the Buddha said comprehend dukka do

102
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,559
we realize it realize it as an

103
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:51,360
insight and this is not a process that is for the faint of heart and we

104
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:58,399
actually really have to stop fighting it at least moment

105
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:05,440
arily to comprehend it and yet most everything in

106
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,240
US rallies the troops to

107
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:20,600
fight and so it's actually a major project to open to one's

108
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:29,840
suffering but sometimes the suffering of of the other is even more

109
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:37,480
evocative and it can be evocative in a way that opens us to kind of very deep

110
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:43,639
compassion something in just seeing you know a loved one suffering

111
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:51,000
it's like oh yeah may may you be free but sometimes

112
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,919
our our care gets tangled up with um

113
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,799
with with uh with a sense of control with some strand of our own

114
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,159
clinging and so the question what would it be to follow the Buddha's instruction

115
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:16,159
of comprehending suffering for another's

116
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:26,200
life and we've um entrusted entrusted our heart

117
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,639
to uh to another either by choice or by

118
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:37,039
birth and that essentially means that all of their suffering feels like

119
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:43,360
our business right when you're a child right

120
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:50,320
the suffering of a parent has huge implications for your own safety it's

121
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,519
not really a cause for compassion their pain is

122
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:03,639
destabilizing it's a threat you know I I I don't know an

123
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:09,320
exact moment but I kind of remember the sense of

124
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,520
being you know a little bit shattered when I had the the kind of fantasy of my

125
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,000
parents omnipotence you know was um

126
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,679
dashed and it was like okay that fantasy crumbles and then

127
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:32,760
the recognition of like we're all this vulnerable

128
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,720
right and there's something like the echo of that

129
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:46,440
destabilization still haunt my love for adults now and their suffering does

130
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,520
something of that sort to my

131
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,400
heart and so there can be this deep wobble when we see loved ones in pain

132
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:05,040
when we see their Neurosis when we see them acting out their greed hate

133
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,680
delusion and just like goodness can kind of resonate with goodness we feel that

134
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:18,320
often we feel that in the Dharma field it's like oh okay yeah our hearts resonate we see somebody see the beauty

135
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,960
of someone's heart and it just does something to us and reverberates

136
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:33,880
and in the same way like two Bells resonating suffering can resonate with

137
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:40,760
suffering Neurosis can resonate with Neurosis something about what they're

138
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:49,839
doing uh lands in a certain way in my heart that spins me even more deeply

139
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,200
than if that suffering were purely my

140
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:02,280
own and researchers have done um you know brain Imaging when when you

141
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:09,880
know seeing uh a loved one suffer with some kind of pain task you know some modest

142
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,800
amount of of pain but partner's in the scanner you're sort of somehow

143
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,960
seeing uh a uh a loved one

144
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,400
suffer and a lot of the brain lights up regions

145
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:33,160
associate with with um understanding you know the the inner

146
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:39,760
states of others mentalization with emotional resonance some of the same parts of the brain that

147
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,760
would happen if if we were getting the

148
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,400
pain kisoro and um tanisa the the monastics for for many years many of you

149
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,720
may know them sat with them but uh I heard this this response of what what

150
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:06,480
you know what is it like to you know what is it like to be in relationship you're both uh these darma people what's

151
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,480
it like to be in relationship having been you know monks and nun you know for

152
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:20,280
a long time and I think Kitty soro's response was it's like relationship is like two

153
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,040
people under one robe two people under one robe they're

154
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:32,640
like very potent answer you know to recognize like okay

155
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,920
what what as a monastic was the okay I was working with this system it's now

156
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,720
working with two two people under one

157
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:52,640
robe and we know that seeing suffering in our own life can get us scrambling to

158
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:58,359
reorder circumstances and

159
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:04,359
when we see the suffering of of someone we care about deeply it's the same we

160
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:12,400
often have to like yeah we work with the impulse to like reorder them who they

161
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:19,200
are you know and compassion devolves in something like this desperation to

162
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,760
change them to make them grow this is not this is not actually compassion this

163
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:32,960
is a certain kind of compulsivity uh because I can see oh it's my aversion

164
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,440
or fear or worry or something is driving the show are they are they going to be

165
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,359
okay or or sometimes it's even more basic is like it's like is this who I

166
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:50,560
love you know we love other imperfect

167
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:57,480
beings right but at some level I think what I want in all of my relationships I

168
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,960
want them to be fully enlightened orats you know that's what I want from

169
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,280
everyone in my life me I can be just like a basket of defilements but you I

170
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,520
need you actually to be free from GRE hate and delusion then maybe I would not

171
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,920
be triggered you know that's kind of the

172
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:27,640
fantasy so we know we know when we respond to our own suffering

173
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,359
with that kind of desperate you know scramble it's often

174
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:43,680
unproductive and somehow it's harder to resist that when it's interpersonal

175
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:50,800
suffering and it maybe takes a kind of balance of of melting and freezing

176
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,800
melting and freezing what I was talking about I

177
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:04,359
think yesterday yday so we melt in the sense that we become clearly aware of their pain we

178
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:11,359
almost inhabit their mind this is empathic

179
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:18,520
connection but uh then we we then there's some freezing too there's some

180
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:25,040
freezing too so in the melting you know this this

181
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:31,200
um line that I I quote offering from a novelist who was ask you know if and how

182
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:38,040
literature changes people and he responded I don't think people change very much to the extent they change at

183
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,079
all it's because of some encounter that has love in

184
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:49,359
it people change at all it's because of some encounter that has love in

185
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,040
it we know it's hard to change we know that well it's hard to change it's hard

186
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,200
to grow at depth and if we're going to do it love will be

187
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:09,160
involved and the kind of cruel perverse irony is that the people we most want to

188
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:17,240
change are often the ones we're most enraged by even though we know anger is the

189
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:24,960
single worst way to get someone to deeply change we

190
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:32,240
might shape them moment but that's not a good behavioral modification program to run them on

191
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,960
anger and our judgment and harshness so there's love there's

192
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:46,599
melting but then we freeze too if their pain freeze in a good sense not you know

193
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:52,480
not in the kind of dissociative sense like freeze in the sense that if their

194
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,560
pain becomes pure emotional contagion it just spins us too

195
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:05,880
much and so there's some sense of boundaries too we care for the other as

196
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:13,319
if their pain were our own but without losing the as if condition Carl Rogers

197
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:20,160
said something something like that and so this is the equinity side of

198
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,760
relating to their pain to their Neurosis to their habits that they can't shake

199
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:34,319
out of This is Love in the face of helplessness I cannot rescue you from

200
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:42,839
this suffering I desperately want to I would even be angry if I could do it if the

201
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:49,359
anger would work but I know that's a dead end I

202
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:54,599
can't and so the equinity needs to counterbalance The

203
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:00,599
Compassion otherwise The Compassion can devolve into an insistence that someone

204
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:06,520
else change that's not what's called

205
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:12,400
for deep buing

206
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:19,480
acceptance we forgive which really means just

207
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:27,960
to understand to understand their inner life to open to our own ambiv that we

208
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:36,920
must tolerate uh the mixed feelings we have about any other person we must tolerate

209
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,480
that maybe there's some sense of loss of

210
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:50,319
grief and we open to that rather than the anger and the kind of pseudo

211
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:55,559
compassion which is often some attempt just to discharge the energy that feels

212
00:43:55,559 --> 00:44:01,240
like too much for our system them can we soothe our own heart it's not

213
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:07,040
self-indulgent to move into some measure of self-compassion when you see the

214
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:14,319
other suffering because if we're spun our interventions

215
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:19,640
will always be misdirected and

216
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:25,280
so we tend to our own heart the deeply

217
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:32,800
evocative pain you know of witnessing a loved one

218
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:38,680
suffer and that love is soothing it uh

219
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:46,559
it weakens the kind of compulsive pseudo compassion compulsive interventionist

220
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:51,599
Spirit of our love lives with Partners

221
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:57,200
or parents or children or other loved ones

222
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:06,520
so again uh L Cohen uh I wish there were a treaty we

223
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:13,880
could sign I do not care who takes this bloody Hill I'm angry and I'm tired all the

224
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:20,559
time I wish there was a treaty I wish there was a treaty

225
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,760
between your love and

226
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:40,599
mine what would that be a treaty between your love and

227
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:47,480
mine in the realm of relationship uh that's a deep

228
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,280
question so I offer this for your uh consideration and

229
00:45:54,280 --> 00:46:02,720
um we'll uh gather back to tomorrow uh tomorrow okay
