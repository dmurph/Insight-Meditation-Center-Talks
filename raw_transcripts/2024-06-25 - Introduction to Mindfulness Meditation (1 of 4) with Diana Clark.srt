1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:08,599
okay so I think we'll get started so welcome welcome everybody Welcome to

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:16,039
IMC for those of you who don't know me I'm Diana clerk I uh teach here regularly on uh Monday

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:22,640
nights except sometimes I'm off teaching Retreats and I just got back yesterday

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,080
from a teaching a beautiful Retreat down at uh IRC it's our sister Center we have

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,320
a retreat center down in Santa Cruz and uh it's a beautiful thing to be able to

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,680
offer um it was a 7-Day silent residential Retreat maybe I'll just say

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,520
a few words about me

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,760
um I found meditation in a time in my life when I

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,480
felt like you know from the outside kind of like look at my life and you would think like oh it's you know

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:05,280
she has everything that she needs I felt like I had everything I needed but somehow I didn't feel

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,439
happy I felt like there's got to be something more as it happens I had a

12
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:19,320
certain amount of professional success I have a PhD in Biochemistry and I don't know I just had

13
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,560
achieved all these things and somehow felt like my life was missing something

14
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,759
and that I was like disconnected from my life in some way and disconnected from

15
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:37,200
the people that I was close to that were close to me I just felt like somehow I

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,479
had followed all the rules but yet my life I don't know just

17
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,600
wasn't turning out the way that I expected or wanted and it was just

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,119
uh I don't know it wasn't like I actually intended to become a meditator

19
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,920
it uh just something that grew out of a a yoga class and a casual comment by

20
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,560
somebody I knew in this yoga class so quite something and I hate to say this but I'm going to ask you to not sit

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:14,120
right there because you're underneath the camera there you go thank you Nicole

22
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,000
yeah so let's see if there's anything else I

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,160
need to say about me um I've done a lot of retreat practice I have spent

24
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:35,840
cumulatively a couple of years years on Retreat silently meditating all day

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,120
long and it's changed my life completely changed my life in such a beautiful way

26
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,040
and I'm very happy to be here to be sharing with you some of what I've discovered what

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,879
I've learned from others and provide an opportunity for you to practice a little and to ask some

28
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:05,080
questions so maybe I'll just say a little bit of about uh meditation so here we're we're doing mindfulness

29
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,519
meditation where the Insight Meditation Center Insight Meditation is often

30
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:16,280
associated with mindfulness meditation sometimes uh similar to what

31
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,599
mbsr John kittson who um started nbsr

32
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:28,720
actually trained at some of the same place I trained and uh Gil frall the founder of this Center trained so

33
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,120
there's you'll find a lot lot of overlap a little bit of difference of course and I do want to just say that so

34
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,239
this practice is comes out of Buddhism more specifically tervada Buddhism but

35
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,400
and I'm not going to talk about Buddhism here I have zero interest in converting anybody to Buddhism you're perfectly

36
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:57,519
welcome to follow whatever spiritual path you have and that's meaningful for you and I'll also say a little bit that

37
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:04,480
um tervada Buddhism and Insight Meditation mindfulness meditation I'm just going to

38
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,879
say it's distinct from Zen and Tibetan Buddhism and I'm not going to go

39
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,320
into the more like exactly how it is I mean I could give a whole Dharma talk on that but we're here to learn how to

40
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,240
meditate so just to bring some clarity like what is it that we're doing here so

41
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,880
just to say explicitly what it is and I would say maybe more generally

42
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,960
we're just taking this natural human

43
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,120
capacity to pay attention we all have this it's not

44
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,680
anything that uh is new and we're just directing it a certain way and

45
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,120
cultivating it so it's something that we're maybe

46
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,720
developing and there's a way in which um in this context that uh we teach it and

47
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,880
practice it here this cultivating this um ability this capacity to pay

48
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,000
attention not only does it lead in general to Greater understanding

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,240
understanding ourselves and in some ways I would say certainly from myself as I started to

50
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,520
understand myself more I started to see oh that's why everybody else does this

51
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:28,960
thing too you know so I just started to have greater understanding of everybody else the more I started to understand

52
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,479
myself I could recognize people's behaviors or things that they would say which I had just

53
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:41,880
kind of like explored or noticed like oh I feel like I understand The Human

54
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,720
Condition much better now but not only does it un create this

55
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,840
more um self- understanding but it also helps create the conditions just for

56
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,199
more stability without knowing it I'll say

57
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:05,479
before I was like pushed around around by my emotions a lot and just kind of like get the felt a little bit of the

58
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:12,120
mercy of you know if I had a bad day I just felt bad or if you know one of my co-workers said something I spent some

59
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,440
time in Corporate America in management uh positions and you know there's a lot

60
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:26,160
of stress I'm sure many of you know this maybe you have Corporate America jobs right now but I discovered um yeah that I

61
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,479
could just get pushed around a little bit by feeling bad or feeling good or

62
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:36,560
just feeling disconnected so this noticing practice is a way that helps us

63
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,720
have some stability and some uprightness no matter what is happening no matter

64
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,960
what is happening this turns out to be such a great gift it just uh makes one's life

65
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:57,960
unfold with so much more ease and openness and I would even say joy and

66
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:04,840
happiness so and maybe I could even enter that and say love and peace all this starts to

67
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:11,240
become more and more available as the body and the mind start to settle down

68
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,240
it's just we don't have to make love and peace arise that's just what arises when

69
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:25,440
settling down happens it's just a natural consequence that occurs and I invite you to discover

70
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,479
that for yourself you don't have to believe me about this

71
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,319
so this is a 4-week uh course um it has been taught as a

72
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,000
five-week course it has been taught as a six- week course but right now it's going to be four

73
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,680
weeks today I'm going to focus on teaching uh mindfulness of the breath

74
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,960
and a little bit about posture and it turns out like these are like foundational

75
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,400
fundamental meditation practices upon which all the others buil build upon so

76
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,199
this is like kind of the the basics which actually could be enough to just

77
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:14,440
take you wherever you wanted to go with meditation practice but it can be helpful to learn more so today will be

78
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,240
the breath next week will be the body third week will be about emotions and

79
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,280
the fourth week will be about thoughts and thinking and they are all build on

80
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,319
the preceding week so it's uh meant to be you know it's sequential

81
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,880
so it's a very intentional the order in which I'm teaching this it doesn't have

82
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,159
to be in this order it could be taught in other ways but uh I'm choosing to do

83
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,279
this uh in this way and in this time

84
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:56,200
frame maybe um something else that I'll say is that I'll be talking about you

85
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:03,720
know meditation usually like formal sitting meditation but so much about what we

86
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,880
learn in sitting meditation will apply to our daily life as well

87
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:16,600
meditating while waiting at the bank this afternoon as I did while I went from one person who told me I had to go

88
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,279
talk to a second person who then told me I had to go talk to a third person and the third person wasn't available and I

89
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:28,120
found like I'm just going to sit here and just rather than getting irritated by how long I'm having to wait at the

90
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:36,600
bank for something I thought was pretty straightforward I'm just going to sit here and calmly do standing

91
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:43,720
meditation what I I I could feel a little bit of irritation arising like oh I don't actually have to go there and

92
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:51,720
just kind of like get settled again you know life unfolds differently if you recognize you have that uh

93
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:59,079
capacity this capability so I'll say a few words about

94
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:07,160
I MC just uh maybe if you don't know everything

95
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:14,480
everything is offered freely here just offered freely IMC runs

96
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:24,360
on uh generosity and so the and people feel inspired and

97
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:31,240
feel appreciate what they discover here and they may choose to make a donation

98
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:38,440
it's not required it's all appreciated but not required there's a donation box near the

99
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,600
door and there's a little kiosk that's uh right around the corner here if you want to use your credit

100
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:52,440
card not required so like I could talk nonstop

101
00:10:52,440 --> 00:11:00,000
for hours about meditation but that's you didn't come here to hear that let's just do a very quick little

102
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,959
meditation get in any posture this is just going to be for 5 minutes so get in any posture that feels comfortable

103
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,920
enough for you

104
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,800
and we'll

105
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:26,920
just feel feel into this moments

106
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:33,279
experience in particular feel the pressure of the chair or the

107
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,880
cushion against your

108
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,720
body feel the contact with the sitting surface

109
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,120
if you're sitting in a chair using the back rest maybe with the

110
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,240
back with the

111
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,639
buttocks the back side of the

112
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,839
legs the feet

113
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,440
we are here in this

114
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,600
location specifically your chair your

115
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,199
cushion and it's

116
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:54,639
now nothing in particular needs to be happening we're just noticing the

117
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,199
pressure against the body

118
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:14,279
and then we can open up the

119
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,000
meditation and hear

120
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:29,639
sounds letting go of the pressure in the body and now turning towards sounds

121
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:36,079
my voice the

122
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:44,399
fan that little rattling noise that shows up when the fan is

123
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,680
going the traffic

124
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,019
[Music]

125
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,759
so just a brief exercise of like intentionally

126
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:06,000
placing our attention on an

127
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,120
experience feeling the pressure against the body and then intentionally moving from

128
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,839
that experience and in some ways kind of like opening up to sounds and

129
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:24,440
just be able to receive whatever sounds are

130
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,880
there I'd love to hear from some of you how was that was that uh like yeah yeah

131
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:38,759
yeah I know how to do this or was it h seems too simple or have some just it

132
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:44,120
was this short thing was there anything that you noticed was it

133
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:51,639
easy was it uh turned out not to be so easy to keep the mind just on the pressure of the body or the sounds or

134
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:59,040
did you find yourself making comments anybody have something they'd like to share

135
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,560
yes Jim can we thank you Jim I should say thank you so much Jim he has been

136
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:16,000
meditating longer than I have and just out of the generosity of his Spirit he's uh helping me out tonight

137
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,279
he's hi there um my what observant I

138
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:28,440
found is that when you were talking about the body and the pressure on my like on my legs and my seat then when

139
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:34,120
you switch said give that up and go with the sounds I I kept finding that I was

140
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:41,720
back on on that all the time it was like it kept pulling me pulling me back so it was hard to move on to something else

141
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:48,040
and was that like this um was it Pleasant or was it unpleasant this both

142
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,440
the pressure against the body and the uh this would think like oh yeah I'm

143
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:01,279
supposed to be on the sounds but I'm here instead just that trying to be on the sounds

144
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:09,600
but really quickly jumping right back to the body every second so I just noticed that

145
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,199
great great this is a noticing practice you noticed I love it thank

146
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,640
you anybody else have a comment

147
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,480
okay I'm going to spend a little time about posture because when you're

148
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:47,240
uncomfortable in meditation right that's like the only thing that happens in meditation often is this you know when

149
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,760
is the Bell going to ring kind of

150
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:59,840
experience so I'll talk about um both with uh on the cushion and on the

151
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:07,039
chair and on a bench when I'm sitting I have one leg in

152
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:13,480
front of the other as often as the most comfortable as opposed to uh there you

153
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:21,679
could you could do quarter Lotus or half Lotus if you know that then go ahead and do that of course but it's this way that

154
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:30,760
um it feels very stable to have two knees and the buttocks right it's just like this tripod it's very stable

155
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,400
the first time I meditated I could do this maybe for 30

156
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,880
seconds and I remember going to a like a meditation center and just being amazed that people

157
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,240
could sit there for you know 30 minutes or 45 minutes I didn't even know it was humanly

158
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,000
possible it's you know so this is definitely something that uh most of us

159
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,360
will have to practice with if we choose to sit on the on the on a

160
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,440
cushion maybe I'll say a few things about this that um I'm sitting on the

161
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,559
very edge of the cushion like maybe the quarter the first I don't have a cushion

162
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:21,520
here to show you but um I'm like on the first quarter of it so 3/4 of the cushion is behind me and I'm just on the

163
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,559
edge of it and part of the reason is so that my

164
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:33,000
hips are are higher than knees this makes a big difference so

165
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,400
higher than are the same level as if the knees end up being higher than the hips

166
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:46,120
then there's this way that kind of like our femur kind of goes down into the hip joint it can be comfortable enough for a

167
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,440
few minutes but uh for extended times it's not so comfortable so it can be

168
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,240
really helpful to have your hips higher than your knees but then you might say but my knee

169
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:06,480
I'm not that flexible I can't do it and so often what we would do we have these

170
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,320
cushions so you can put maybe a cushion here because we don't want the knees to

171
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:19,840
be uh just dangling we want to have a sense of stability so if your flexibility only allows something like

172
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,440
this then I would get a second zuu the

173
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,559
round ones and then yeah would get up

174
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:37,360
higher and or do something like this under the under the knees so that you

175
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:44,799
really have this contact with the ground so we want to feel

176
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:54,400
stable maybe while I'm still on the not not in a chair I'll say also an

177
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,520
alternative is to sit in a bench I'm going to talk about the chair in a moment so sitting in a chair is

178
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:06,960
perfectly legitimate perfectly legitimate just cuz I'm not so tall actually chairs are not that comfortable

179
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,200
for me so I always sit like this when I'm teaching or meditating or this so

180
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,279
that's just you know this Anatomy uh prefers to sit on the floor but that's not true for everybody of

181
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:23,320
course um these uh benches can be a way if you

182
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:30,840
don't have the flexibility to do something like this you can do something like this put

183
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:38,039
this back here and you just put this behind you maybe I should go this

184
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,080
way oh is it

185
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,279
here and so my uh my knees aren't like this so my hips don't have to be as

186
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:56,520
flexible and the spine is can be straight up just as it can elsewhere

187
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:03,279
this can be really comfortable and when I was first beginning I would uh alternate between the cushion and this

188
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:09,440
and a chair like all three sometimes if the um yeah maybe

189
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,640
I'll just keep this this simple so there's these benches a whole slew of benches

190
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:22,840
underneath the stage there right at the end of the stage there and then I'll say a few things

191
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:30,480
about the chair and if you're like you're welcome to go get some cushions but first I want to say a few things about the chair

192
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:38,320
same principle holds with the chair about hips higher than knees or the same

193
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:45,000
level as knees so if you have really long legs this mean you want to put a cushion on

194
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,679
the chair and sit on the cushion that's on the chair if you're like me and your legs are not very long then uh you put your

195
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:59,400
feet uh you put a cushion underneath your feet so as it would kind of like bring the ground up want to have both

196
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,520
feet uh firmly on the ground the body and the mind are so

197
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,520
connected much more than we might realize so when there's a sense of stability in the body it really helps

198
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:18,080
having a sense of H stability in the mind

199
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,799
too what you do with your hands you can do whatever you like um

200
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:35,000
but we recommend that you like be uh have some symmetry so whatever is happening on one hand is the same with

201
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,080
the other I tend to put my hands here because I like to have a neutral wrist

202
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,120
but some people will put it on like put their hands here a little bit of a Bend

203
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:51,520
here the only thing to notice is whether your hands are a little bit here and there's a little bit of pulling on the

204
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:58,919
shoulders because then there's this rounding of the shoulders and instead what we want is this straight spine and

205
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:04,799
the arms just hang from it and then they can be however they

206
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,760
want to think about having the ears over the shoulders so maybe the chin goes

207
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,840
back just a little bit just a tiny bit to make sure that there's this uh that

208
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:23,039
we're not leaning forward these days with computers right so or cellones

209
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:30,360
right there's this way in which the head is not um over the shoulders very often

210
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,360
if some of you would like to get up and go get some uh cushions you're welcome to or a bench you're welcome to do that

211
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:46,440
no requirement of course and uh we'll do a a meditation another meditation here in a few minutes

212
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,679
maybe I'll sit on this I'm a little bit

213
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:30,320
taller maybe there's one one more thing I could say about hands

214
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,399
is that sometimes it's helpful to have something like this in your hands

215
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:44,399
because it takes the pressure off of the shoulder which takes the pressure off of the spine so it can be helpful to just

216
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:50,320
have a cushion here a lot of people practice this

217
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:58,919
way again there's absolutely no requirement to um be on the floor I I

218
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:04,159
once taught a retreat there was five of us meditation teachers six of us

219
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:11,120
meditation teachers and I was the only one on the cushion and five of them were uh in a chair so it's perfectly fine to

220
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:17,000
be in a chair but unless you grew up kind of like sitting on the floor it will be

221
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,279
uncomfortable at the beginning it's not uncomfortable for me now right so it's

222
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:30,240
just something that um the more you do it the easier it gets just like everything else right

223
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,120
I'm looking at my notes to see if I've forgot

224
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,360
anything this is not as stable as I would like it on this uh so I'm going

225
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,240
to use a cushion here

226
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,679
does anybody have any uh questions about

227
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:22,559
posture can I make a few comments about what I see you might want to move up so

228
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:29,320
move a little bit forward on your off yeah just so that your knees are on the ground a little bit little bit more yeah

229
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:36,790
there you go that's a little bit easier y Le like

230
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:43,240
[Laughter] beautiful Yan Le is she'll be giving instructions soon and same with Lydia

231
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,679
who's sitting next to her so great

232
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:55,080
great okay I don't I see how do you want to

233
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:00,200
put a cushion under your knees here's some cushions here if you want to just up here

234
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:06,840
and can we can you maybe you can hand these back to him or then we can like do a a group

235
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:14,679
a that might be a little high the red one there and you can fold you can fold

236
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,080
these right you can fold this in half to make

237
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,559
it there we

238
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:31,399
go so as I

239
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:39,120
mentioned so mindfulness practice is a noticing

240
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:46,279
practice and if we set up this idea that um actually this meditation practice is

241
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:52,000
to get rid of our thoughts or to Bliss

242
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,240
out [Music] or discover the truth of some

243
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:05,519
question we have that's a different goal than

244
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:11,159
noticing doesn't mean those things don't happen but we really are orienting

245
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:17,799
towards we just want to notice what's

246
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:24,679
happening and so it doesn't require that we're in complete Comfort or that the

247
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:33,360
mind is completely settled or something like that we're just noticing what happens and if

248
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:40,360
you notice that your mind wanders then you're you're practicing in the

249
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:48,399
right way because so often in our days our mind is just wandering and we have no idea it's wandering it's just uh

250
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:56,080
doing what Minds do so it's pretty common that with the

251
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,799
meditation if we set a an object I'll guide us in a moment with

252
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:09,279
the breath it's kind of like if you come

253
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,880
to and this happened to me not so long ago where you're let's say you're out

254
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:21,559
hiking and there's this uh this some water and you're not sure like is this

255
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:28,240
just a swampy area or is this like a very slow moving Creek

256
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:34,120
maybe it's not clear so uh you take a stick and you put the stick in the water

257
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:40,960
and then you could see oh there's this very little wake next to the stick like oh yeah okay this is a creek it's is

258
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,159
moving and it's going this direction in the same way in the exact

259
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:54,399
same way we choose to put our mind on one thing and then we notice how much it's

260
00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:01,080
not on that one thing and that's part of what this practice is

261
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:07,159
we start to notice what takes us away what are our patterns of mind what are

262
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:14,760
habits what ises the mind like to do we would never notice that unless we were trying to put it here on the

263
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:20,440
object and then of course the more we do it more we keep it on the object the

264
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:26,919
anchor the breath I'm going to lead us in the breath then it becomes easier and

265
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:35,039
easier but in the beginning we're like here on the breath and then the Mind goes and then gee I have to remember to

266
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:41,120
stop at the grocery store when I get home what time does that place close and it's so nice that the light is blah blah

267
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,080
blah blah blah blah right oh right I'm supposed to do that meditation thing and then come

268
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,399
back and then off you'll go I can't believe my boss said that to me today

269
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:59,519
what should I have to you know these are just the things that happen and then you'll wake up at of it and just come

270
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:07,679
back so when you find yourself like you wake up you realize I'm using the word wake up to like when you notice oh yeah

271
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,440
I'm supposed to be medita I was off planning

272
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,679
worrying fantasizing remembering doing all these

273
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:26,399
things we don't have to make it be a problem in the sense that we don't have

274
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:33,080
to create a narrative such as my mind wandered I noticed I'm a

275
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,919
terrible meditator I can't do it everybody else can do it look at them they're sitting still and you know we

276
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:44,720
often will like build this little story on top of when we realize that the we're

277
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,080
no longer on the breath you just notice oh yeah the mind was thinking and come

278
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:58,240
back to the breath we don't have to say we don't have to make a a value judgment out of

279
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,279
this cuz it's very often that people will have this goal or they think that

280
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:08,760
there should be no thinking or that they should be completely

281
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:15,960
relaxed this does happen but it doesn't happen um and you know at the very

282
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,799
beginning of a meditation practice we're just

283
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,320
noticing we're going to like choose an anchor and then when you have an anchor

284
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:35,200
then as we go in these further weeks we'll turn towards things that are compelling things that are like really

285
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,720
drawing our attention it turns out sooner or later

286
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,880
everything in your life will show up is being compelling you don't have to go find it

287
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,840
you don't have to chase it everything will just Bubble Up When It's the time for it to Bubble

288
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,399
Up so we'll just stay here with the anchor and when we discover that we've

289
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:07,600
been lost in thought we're like oh lost in thought and come back so I'm using the word anchor an object as synonyms

290
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,800
and as these weeks go we're going to change what they are but for this guided meditation we're going to use the breath

291
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:19,520
and I would say that's the foundational practice for the

292
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,760
breath okay so let's take a

293
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:32,599
posture have some upright brightness in the posture that expresses your

294
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:39,960
intention to meditate so has this maybe a sense of

295
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:48,280
uh the word that comes to mind maybe a little bit of [Music]

296
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,679
nobility as this uprightness and some

297
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:02,839
ease and this might take take a little time to get the hang of how to have this

298
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:06,520
uprightness and

299
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:17,599
ease we'll start the same way we started the other

300
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,160
meditation just feeling the pressure against the

301
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:31,119
body feeling the contact with the sitting

302
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,838
surface again it might be the back if you're in a

303
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:58,640
chair the buttocks

304
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,800
the back of the

305
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:21,280
legs the feet feeling what the feet are

306
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:29,559
touching feeling grounded connected we're here

307
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,720
maybe you can just scan your body see if there's some obvious places of tension

308
00:36:51,720 --> 00:37:00,240
or holding common places are around the

309
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,200
eyes or around the

310
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:15,720
jaw the shoulders letting the shoulder blades

311
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:21,119
slide down the back away from the ears

312
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:39,880
and then rest the attention on the

313
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:47,000
experience of breathing that might be the belly moving

314
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,599
in and out might be the chest or rib cage

315
00:37:53,599 --> 00:38:01,040
expanding Contracting or it might be the feeling of air going

316
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:09,359
in and out of the nose whichever one of those three areas

317
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:15,960
feels the most comfortable most accessible just rest your attention

318
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,960
there

319
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:55,400
feeling from the inside so to speak what does it feel like to have an

320
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:04,400
in breath feeling the stretch or the movement

321
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:38,200
feeling this stretch I'm sorry feeling the experience

322
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:44,920
of an exhale how does that feel

323
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:33,160
and when the mind wanders as it's apt to do we just very simply gently begin again

324
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,520
with the sensations of breathing

325
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,359
nothing in particular needs to be happening we're just noticing this

326
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,200
sensations of

327
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:39,760
breathing it doesn't need to be any words or just

328
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:56,240
feeling but if there were words there would be more like

329
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,160
adjectives e

330
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:34,920
there's nothing to figure out we're just noticing the sensations

331
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,160
of breathing

332
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:27,400
doesn't matter how many times you have to begin again

333
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:37,319
just when we wake up out of thinking just very simply begin again

334
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:40,520
with the sensations of

335
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,040
breathing

336
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,079
for for

337
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:11,160
can you give yourself over to the sensations of

338
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:18,558
breathing letting the thoughts go they can take care of

339
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,960
themselves for

340
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:14,000
if you find yourself really tired wanted dozing off you can straighten up your

341
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,119
posture that often can make a

342
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,880
difference for

343
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:13,280
just tuning into being sensitive to the experience of

344
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,960
breathing feeling the

345
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,839
Rhythm

346
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,800
e for

347
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:38,000
if you notice that you're thinking can you choose to be with the

348
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,400
sensations of breathing letting the thinking just be

349
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:49,480
in the background of the experience of breathing in the

350
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,720
foreground

351
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,680
for for

352
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:23,680
maybe you can run a little experiment here and just see if you can notice what

353
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:31,200
is happening whatever is happening in a

354
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:38,040
nonjudgmental a very ordinary way just notice what's happening in your

355
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,040
experience

356
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:08,960
what's it like to have non-judgmental noticing oh it's like this right

357
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:16,880
now it's just like this we don't have to add anything extra

358
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:59,589
[Music]

359
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:15,240
when I was first learning to meditate I would be like ring the bell ring the bell ring the bell when are you going to ring the

360
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:19,920
bell maybe some of you had that experience

361
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,920
too so in that meditation I started by directing you to feel the pressure

362
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:35,040
against the body I like to do this as a way to start because it's a way to feel

363
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:41,480
really connected with this uh with the location of where I am present

364
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:47,960
moment and then maybe to do a little bit just a general body scan just to see if there are some areas of the body which

365
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:55,160
are really tense and that it can be that bringing awareness to them bringing attention to them allows a certain

366
00:52:55,160 --> 00:53:00,359
amount of softening not always but

367
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:05,720
sometimes and then to rest the attention on the sensations of

368
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:13,440
breathing sometimes we can think about breathing and think that we're meditating on the breath so that's

369
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,559
partly why I suggested like just to feel how an inhale is like to break up the

370
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:24,720
breath into more than you know into its parts and just notice the inhales and

371
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:31,119
then the exhales and then when you notice that you're

372
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:37,079
lost in thought just begin again on the breath that it can be that simple it's

373
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:42,119
very simple I'm not saying this is super easy and you can get it right away this

374
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:49,280
is definitely a practice but it doesn't have to be complicated and part of its power and I

375
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:55,000
would say its transformative power is the Simplicity of it the things that we

376
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,240
kind let go of in that shed when we kind of like stay with the Simplicity of the

377
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:06,720
experience just enables us to be in the Simplicity of other experiences instead

378
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:11,960
of filling our minds with a you know kind like getting disconnected from our

379
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:18,240
experience and planning or not listening to what somebody's telling us instead we're

380
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:25,319
trying to plan what we're going to tell them or something like this so I'd love to hear some comments

381
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:31,760
or questions how was that was that easy peasy or was it like oh my gosh I can

382
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:37,799
wait for you to ring the bell or was it uh feel like really Diana aren't we

383
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:43,079
going to do something more complicated or I don't know anything you'd like to

384
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:50,119
add or ask yeah I noticed that as soon as I put my attention on my

385
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:55,520
breathing my breathing went from automatic to manual so it was sort of

386
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:00,599
like as soon as I paid attention to it I was like how do I

387
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:06,119
breathe am I breathing too big like I kind of you know it's not really

388
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:14,760
observing it was more like I was doing it intentionally but kind of forgetting how I normally breathe yeah yeah um can

389
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:21,280
you turn down the volume just a little bit I think we're getting some feedback that little feedback thank

390
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:28,359
you is that what's supposed to happen or it's so common it's very very common

391
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:34,640
that we feel like oh actually I'm going to control the breath a little bit it's part of noticing and controlling go

392
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:41,480
together it's perfectly okay it's something that uh will just work itself out it'll just uh eventually you won't

393
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:47,119
feel like so much you have to control but then I will say that sometimes we feel like we need to control the

394
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:52,920
controlling and then we have the control the control of the controlling right and then we just get wrapped up so it can be

395
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:59,359
helpful if you feel like in some ways you're kind of like getting wrapped up in this uh not wanting to control the

396
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:05,559
breath and you didn't say this I'm just maybe offering this for anybody else as well then it can be helpful sometimes to

397
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:11,520
open up to sounds and then come back to the breath kind of like you know interrupt the

398
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:18,480
momentum of the that we might get into a little tessle with that trying to control the breath or

399
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:27,039
something was that was that helpful yes thank you anybody else uh have a comment

400
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:32,599
we'd like you to use the microphone just so everybody can hear okay thank

401
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:37,640
you just uh two questions if you're in the chair should you not rest on the

402
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:42,760
back you should be actually forward yeah so thank you for asking that the

403
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:49,760
question you know should we use the back rest if you can if your back allows you it's much turns out to be much easier to

404
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,839
not use the back rest but a lot of people do and often what happens if

405
00:56:54,839 --> 00:57:01,640
you're just a beginner meditator you don't have the strength to like sit without a back rest and so uh sometimes

406
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:07,599
we'll people will start without a back rest and then maybe uh lean back for a little bit and then come forward but to

407
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:13,839
do it in an easy Gentle Way and it can be really worthwhile to work up those uh

408
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:19,720
muscles to be able to sit without a back rest and the second question is um when

409
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:27,000
you're exhaling should you open your mouth like you you know should you ex like deeply open your mouth and

410
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:34,319
no we're not doing any the question was with the exhale should you uh open your mouth and deeply exhale no we're keeping

411
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:42,680
the breath completely natural for this practice we're not doing anything intentional with it okay thank

412
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:54,960
you hello um I'm just wondering it was really hard for me to not focus on my

413
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:01,920
body and how that my knees were feeling um so any tips for especially when your

414
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:09,079
foot's falling asleep how do we focus on the breath when our knees are killing us yeah I I I

415
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:15,799
was waiting for somebody to ask this question because of course this happens in the beginning or something like this

416
00:58:15,799 --> 00:58:21,559
and I'm assuming that it was uh uncomfortable the sensation in your knee is that right yeah

417
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:28,240
yeah next week we'll talk a lot about the body and how to be with the body I'll say a few things here to uh talk

418
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:36,240
about some of the discomfort um one is that you can zoom

419
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:44,400
in in one kind of way so what I mean by this is to bring some curiosity to it to

420
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:50,960
like okay this is uncomfortable but is it a stabing or a tingling or a

421
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:59,359
throbbing and so we're just resting our attention and you know bringing some cous osity to it and then we can ask so

422
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:06,440
not only the particulars about the sensation and then we can also ask about the location is it very specific or is

423
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:12,200
it broad is it moving or is it in one place the point is not to find the

424
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:18,319
answer so much as it's to shift our relationship to it because we're

425
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:25,280
probably like dang it I wish this wouldn't be happening there's often like this aversion and sometimes I can turn

426
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:32,119
into anger and you know all these types of things but you know the truth is right there's a lot of discomfort in

427
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:39,839
this Human Experience so there's something about uh being able to build our capacity to be with discomfort and

428
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:46,039
one way is to shift our relationship away from aversion towards

429
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:51,440
curiosity so that's one way is to maybe like to dive in and to just bring some

430
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:59,280
curiosity there a second way is maybe to as best you can go to something neutral

431
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:06,000
so it might not be easy to do right if it's really calling your you know if it's really painful then uh you might

432
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,440
not be able to do that but if it's just like an itch which maybe isn't painful but it's calling your attention you

433
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,839
didn't say this but I'm just saying this in general for everybody um you can go

434
01:00:16,839 --> 01:00:21,960
to a neutral experience pressure against the body something like this just like

435
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:27,359
bring the Mind back and back and back this practice is all about just bringing

436
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:32,559
the Mind back back back and then maybe a third thing that

437
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:42,359
I'll offer also when there's an un maybe there's two more things third thing is um we can instead of zooming in Zoom way

438
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:50,200
out so um as if you're like the birds ey View

439
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:57,240
and maybe like how that uh plays out is yes this comfortable sensation is in my

440
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,280
knee and I feel the pressure in my body and I feel the breath oh discomfort in

441
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:07,839
the knee pressure in the body discomfort in the knee pressure in the body discomfort in the knee sound something

442
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:13,280
like this but there's this way when something's uncomfortable we tend to kind of collapse into it and it becomes

443
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:20,200
our whole experience and we just get in this wrestling match and you know I used

444
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:27,079
to get like so angry when I was like uncomfortable and I would start blaming I would blame anybody and anything like

445
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:33,400
this is wrong this has to be different so that's the Third Way zooming in

446
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:39,079
neutral zoom out the fourth way is to shift your posture but shift your

447
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:46,079
posture while being mindful it's like oh this knee is really

448
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:51,240
uncomfortable my foot is falling asleep I'm going to die if this batt doesn't

449
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:57,039
ring I'm going to move my left leg and we would like say this like in kind of

450
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:02,839
in your mind okay I'm going to move my left leg and then we move the leg feel

451
01:02:02,839 --> 01:02:09,359
it feel how it is in this new posture and then go back to the breath so it's

452
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:17,039
not like we stop meditating shift and then come back to meditating we just fold the shifting of the posture into

453
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:22,200
the meditation that it was a long answer but was that helpful yeah thank you you're

454
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:27,838
welcome I'll talk more about this tomorrow or next week

455
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:35,039
anybody else have a comment or

456
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:46,039
question how many of you usually meditate using an

457
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:55,520
app and so this uh sometimes comes up with a question it's like well what

458
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:01,400
about music like is it okay to have you know like some relaxing music there's

459
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:07,599
nothing wrong with that but what we're doing here is we're learning some

460
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:12,760
selfreliance you might say we're increasing our capacity in so many

461
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:20,160
different ways capacity to um recognize what the mind is doing to notice to come

462
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:26,720
back to gain some self- understanding and so with that

463
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:33,559
it's often better to not have music so it's I mean if you're meditating only to relax that's

464
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:40,440
something different and that you know you can do whatever you like with that too of course right relaxing and stuff but here

465
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:46,000
we're um building as part of a practice to really honestly can transform Our

466
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:53,920
Lives make us having this stability and peace and ease that definitely 100%

467
01:03:53,920 --> 01:04:02,039
translates off of the cushion into your life I mean relaxed is helpful too of

468
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:10,440
course often people ask but I'm falling

469
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:18,440
asleep what can I do there maybe I'll say for some people it

470
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:25,720
might be better to sleep than to meditate honestly because we are such a

471
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:33,000
kind of you know we have this go go go culture and why don't need to you know wake up early early staying up late up

472
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,480
early this type of thing and if you're just physically tired you won't be able

473
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:46,160
to meditate right your body needs to sleep so for some of you maybe you know need to have a a sleeping practice

474
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:52,240
rather than a meditation practice that's okay right of course there are some things if you find

475
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:59,200
yourself really sleepy I mentioned like you know just have some uprightness in the

476
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:05,400
posture I'll say that um if I'm going to fall asleep um it'll while meditating

477
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:12,680
it's only if I'm sitting in a chair leaning with a back rest it's there's something about that that uh you know

478
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:18,000
it's easier to sleep but you know just holding the body up takes just a little

479
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:25,960
bit more energy and that helps keep one awake also there can be a helpful to

480
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:31,359
open one's eyes but to keep the Gaze kind of like just down here so not

481
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:37,880
looking at anything but having light come in because usually when we sleep

482
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:44,559
right we don't have our eyes open of course right so and just notice if the eyes are falling asleep and or closing

483
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,680
and then just open them back

484
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:56,799
up if you really want to meditate and you're really sleepy

485
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:02,119
then people often will do standing meditation you can you know just stand

486
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:09,278
in one place and meditate and that can be way usually you won't fall asleep if you're standing too

487
01:06:11,799 --> 01:06:17,279
so are there any more comments or

488
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:26,319
questions um what about the the time of day like should you do it first thing in the morning then you be

489
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:32,960
sleepy or away yep thank you she was asking like what time of day should we do this and that's where I was going

490
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:39,440
next is um it can be really helpful to have a regular meditation practice of

491
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:44,880
course this is just just like playing the piano or learning to ride a bike learning to drive any of these things

492
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:50,319
right the more you do it the easier it gets right this of course so to meditate

493
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:56,559
regularly and it can be really helpful to actually experiment in the beginning

494
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:02,079
when is it the best for you to meditate for some people it's uh best first thing

495
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:07,200
in the morning because the we haven't yeah it's just the mind isn't cluttered

496
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:13,839
with all the other things that they uh that the Mind happens to do so some people I'll have a cup of coffee first

497
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:20,640
and then uh you know have a cup of um then meditate I find myself uh meditating

498
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:27,079
midm morning but you know my uh schedule allows that to happen I like to do go

499
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:34,119
outside go for a walk or something like this first thing in the morning and then um a little bit later I'll uh meditate

500
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:40,079
some people meditate at the end of the day it just find a way it's just kind of helps

501
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:46,799
to um unwind from the end of the day but it can be really helpful to just explore

502
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:52,799
okay what is it like what's the difference between the end of the day oh I know some people who meditate at lunch

503
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:59,480
actually somebody who go sits in their car from their job and just sits in their car for 10 minutes and meditates

504
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:06,240
right so you know whatever your life allows and I think it's worthwhile

505
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:12,400
experimenting what's it like in the evening what is it like in the morning what is it like at lunch time or

506
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:20,440
something like this so and then the question often shows up is uh well how

507
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:28,000
long as long as you well so you know I'm kind of like I think you should meditate

508
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:36,238
for 2 hours no I'm just kidding I think 20 minutes fantastic if

509
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:43,560
you can do 10 minutes that's great if you can do five minutes that's okay too if you do nothing but just get into the

510
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:49,679
meditation posture take three breaths that can be okay

511
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:57,960
too because often what happens is we have this sense like oh I should meditate but I don't have time I'll do

512
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:04,278
it later and then you know it just doesn't happen or oh I want to meditate but it's painful in my knee so I'm not

513
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:10,640
going to do it or something but there's something about if nothing else just like taking the meditation posture and

514
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:17,318
three breaths just kind of like reminds ourself that oh yeah it doesn't have to

515
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:23,440
be a giant Endeavor it doesn't have to be um something that we have to

516
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:31,120
rearrange our entire life for initially right and then we'll do three breaths and then you know five breaths and then

517
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:37,880
five minutes and you know something like that but start where you are I I if you

518
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:45,640
can I would say 20 minutes but you if that just feels like way too much 10 minutes and then a question often arises

519
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:51,278
about a timer maybe it doesn't arise because there's so many timers on phones now

520
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:54,559
these days

521
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:04,560
I would say some people um ask about well I have my clock like right in front

522
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:11,000
my phone that's counting down like right in front of me and I'm sometimes I just find myself watching it waiting for this

523
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:17,159
it can be helpful to have the phone out of you and just give yourself over that

524
01:10:17,159 --> 01:10:23,560
uh you'll get up when the when the bell rings

525
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:30,920
and then I'd say if you don't meditate at all if you like maybe set the

526
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:39,400
intention okay I'm going to meditate every day and you find yourself just not meditating even once notice why not like

527
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:47,239
notice like what is it that's uh like uh getting in the way that this is a noticing practice

528
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:56,600
right so just notice if you're not doing that what's getting in the way that can be really supportive for one's life too

529
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:02,760
and then I'll offer something else about um practicing at home is of course you

530
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:08,239
know I'm sitting here in a meditation posture I'm giving instructions for a meditation posture but meditation

531
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:15,280
doesn't have to happen in a meditation posture so something that can be really helpful is to

532
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:22,520
choose an activity that you do every day that takes a short amount of time and

533
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:29,640
just notice all the sensations ass associated with that a common one is

534
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:37,520
brushing one's teeth just like okay I'm just going to how does the toothbrush feel in my hand what's the weight of it

535
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:45,400
what does toothpaste really taste like and uh if you have an electric one you know feeling the the vibration or you

536
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:51,360
know and just feel your feet on the ground feel the water in the mouth as you rinse you just be there completely

537
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:58,360
with that experience and as you find the Mind watering just come back to the brushing the teeth and so that can be a

538
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:05,880
real support to just choose something like this to uh bring some mindfulness for yes can we bring that microphone

539
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:09,120
back there thank you

540
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:20,800
Jim uh do you encounter people who sometimes avoid meditation because you

541
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:27,199
are just afraid to be by yourself and encounter where confront yourself your

542
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:36,000
thoughts yes okay so what's the solution for that so I would say now that we're going

543
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,800
to just come back to the breath just come back to the breath so with

544
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:47,880
thoughts well we're going to do a whole week on thoughts um but I think it's

545
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:54,199
tremendous let's see so your question is do people avoid because of the thoughts that arise is that is that you no it's

546
01:12:54,199 --> 01:13:01,120
like almost like being afraid of by being afraid of being by yourself

547
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:07,360
because now you're going to encounter or confront your your all the random thoughts that come into your

548
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:15,080
mind so some are good and some are maybe not so good so yeah then maybe just be

549
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:22,480
in a meditation posture do three breaths and then do three breaths when you're waiting at a stoplight do three breaths

550
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:27,800
when you're wait waiting for the other person on the phone to pick up you know these

551
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:35,080
types of things just sprinkle it throughout the day and it starts to become easier and easier but this is not uncommon right

552
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:43,440
that people don't want to be with their thoughts there's a lot of scary stuff that's happening in here yeah

553
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:51,159
yeah oh so you mentioned not leaning back on

554
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:58,440
the chair so much I mean is there like an energetic thing that's happening by not being supported

555
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:04,239
by a chair or it just turns out that um there's something when the spine when

556
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:09,440
all the vertebrae are stacked like one on the other and the arms are just able

557
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:15,199
to hang then you can sit like this for a very long time probably you don't notice

558
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:21,120
this but when you're sitting in a chair lean back you're adjusting your posture subtly all the time so

559
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:26,600
frequently and so uh it's just a little more stable and steady to just be

560
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:32,639
upright like this so that's one an energetic I don't know this is something

561
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:38,080
you can explore and just feel see how it is okay thank you you're

562
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:44,560
welcome okay so we're at the end of our time together so thank you for coming

563
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:53,280
and you're welcome to come up and ask me some questions afterwards if you have thank you thank you
