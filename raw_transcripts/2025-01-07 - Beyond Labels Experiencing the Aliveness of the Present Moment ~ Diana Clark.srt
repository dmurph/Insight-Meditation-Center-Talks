1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:07,359
good evening welcome welcome especially if this is your first

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:16,000
time here at IMC a warm welcome so I'll just say briefly that uh

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,080
on Thursday nights Tanya Weiser teaches here it's a little bit different style a little bit more

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,279
interactive a little bit more guidance I think with the meditation and then on Sunday mornings

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,480
is skill from stall the founder and on Wednesday mornings often

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,840
is also Gil too so these we and then there's a lot if you look at our

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,760
calendar there's a lot of stuff happening here and you're welcome to all of them there's a few things that are

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,520
happening that are like year-long courses that are we're in the middle of them and I think those aren't on the

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:01,239
calendar so so if it's on the calendar you're welcome to come

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,680
and then I feel like I should say happy new year right happy New Year

11
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,960
everybody it's uh I was thinking about this is it is this whole idea maybe

12
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,640
you've had this thought too of New Year is kind of funny it's a little bit arbitrary like okay Tuesday and then

13
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,360
Wednesday but all of a sudden it's a different year and this you know these Concepts

14
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,560
these ideas that we put on certain things for me today feels like the new

15
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:39,520
year right the first Monday in January kind of feels like oh this is the beginning of the new

16
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:47,680
year but you know calendars are handy having names for years weeks months days

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:55,119
is Handy it's helpful so we use them it's very useful but I think many of us recognize

18
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,520
that these are just Concepts right I mean if you you were

19
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,640
to write 2024 on a date for something the experience is exactly the

20
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,560
same right whether you're writing 225 2025 or 2024 right like the

21
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,640
experience is the same of when you're actually doing it maybe in the same way

22
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,360
that when we have three-day weekends sometimes like Tuesdays feel like Wednesdays or maybe Wednesdays feel like

23
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,840
Tuesdays whatever The Experience doesn't change if all day

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:43,480
long you thought it was Tuesday but it was really Wednesday you still felt hungry at noon you still felt like you

25
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:50,000
should take the dog out for a walk at a certain time or you know whatever the experiences are the

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,680
same but it's just these Concepts that we put on top which are useful and

27
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,840
helpful and and so much about meditation is actually to help us see this

28
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,920
distinction in a particular way maybe in a deeper

29
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,280
way this distinction between experiences and Concepts

30
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,920
and I brought along some props I don't often do this but I don't

31
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,720
know I just felt like somehow doing this okay so here we are we have a very

32
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,680
helpful office supply a binder clip this humble binder clip very

33
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:41,159
helpful it's nice we use these I use these sometimes when I have I still use paper for a lot of things I like paper

34
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:47,480
you know I I grew up using paper so uh I like paper okay this is a modest binder

35
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,680
clip and then here's a pen it's just a

36
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,879
ordinary pen ballpoint pen we could say the pen is bigger than

37
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,439
the binder clip there's no trick question about this this is very straightforward there's

38
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:11,000
nothing uh uh tricky about this this one's bigger the pen the binder clip is

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,959
smaller we're just looking at size just physical size one's big one small big

40
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:24,840
small no nothing tricky here until we do this little magic trick

41
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,919
Tada what was big is no longer big when it's compared we have six scissors here

42
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:39,280
which are bigger so now what we were was calling big is now maybe middle

43
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,759
sized you're like Diana we're not in kindergarten what are you

44
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,759
doing these Concepts that we add they're not inherent to the thing there's

45
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,479
nothing about this pen that is inherently big it's just big when it's compared to

46
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:02,880
something smaller and it's middle ized when it's compared to something

47
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,240
bigger but how often do we think that the concepts that we appli to something

48
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,160
is inherent to this thing to this

49
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,360
person to this group of people them over there those are the

50
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:29,319
people that are bad or good or something like this there's not concepts are something

51
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:37,280
that we adding on top of a red skinny thing that makes a

52
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,400
clicky sound and has a ink on the one end of

53
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,199
it we're calling this a pen it could also be a two toy if a person wear a dog

54
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,960
or or if somebody for a dog I should say if uh it could also if I were to throw

55
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,600
this at somebody maybe it could be a means to get their attention

56
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,599
it's no longer served as a ped right or if um I was trying to describe what the

57
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:14,400
color red was this could just be something else right there's nothing inherent into these labels I was saying

58
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,520
the label big that wasn't inherent the label pen isn't inherent in this there

59
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,479
are so many ways in which we're using words and Concepts which are so useful

60
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,759
we need them and it's not the same the map is not the

61
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:40,080
territory we've heard this expression the words that we're using

62
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,560
the language that we're using isn't the same as the

63
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:53,120
experience isn't the same as what the objects

64
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,759
are so in the simplest terms we can say a concept is maybe like a label

65
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:06,680
that we put on to something and and

66
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:13,080
makes it feel and we might mistake or conflate that label with the actual

67
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,440
object in some places this makes perfect sense like if I were to say like uh for

68
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:25,960
example Insight Meditation Center is a a concept right what is Insight Meditation

69
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:33,240
Center is it uh is it this spell is it this statue is it this uh building

70
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,879
but then what about like the ebels that go out or you know the people that uh

71
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:45,919
practice here or whatever it is like Insight Meditation Center is kind of like a concept very

72
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,680
useful so that in some ways these labels are

73
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,960
extra and we don't realize how we often we're moving

74
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,720
through life with these ideas conceptions preconceptions

75
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:12,240
projections thoughts beliefs and these beliefs about

76
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:20,599
ourselves about life about other people and these are just Concepts and ideas

77
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:27,240
they're not what's they're not real they're they're not the actual

78
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:35,279
experience so for some examples or we might have some ideas about

79
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,680
ourselves that um I can't do

80
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,320
that that that this I'm never angry dang it don't tell me

81
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,120
that which I actually said apparently at one time somebody did say to me Diana

82
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:01,320
you this was a meditation teacher that told me this quite some time ago early in my practice apparently I proclaimed I

83
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,600
was never angry and then a few years later this person saw me and I was really

84
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:15,480
angry right we have ideas about ourselves right and then we try to uh like re

85
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:23,160
interpret our experiences in order to map these ideas but the same ways we might have

86
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,839
ideas about other people because they live in that part of

87
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:36,720
the world that part of the continent whatever it might be that part of the planet that part of the city that part

88
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:44,079
of the county that part of the street whatever it might be we might just have ideas like oh yeah there's those people

89
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:50,120
over there and we might think that they're great we might think that they're

90
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,560
terrible but there's this way that we're kind of like diminishing their humanity and not recognizing maybe maybe they're

91
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:05,560
tremendously generous to their Community to their family maybe they are fantastic

92
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,560
caretakers for their loved ones or for others maybe they're fantastic

93
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:17,880
caretakers for themselves maybe they have a terrible disease but they are meeting it as best they can with taking

94
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,240
good care of themselves instead of you know trying to deny and pretend it's not

95
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:34,640
happening I had this a experience where this was a number of years ago I

96
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,040
had to have some medical test I don't remember what they were testing for so it must have been negative whatever the

97
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,720
results were but um it required that they were going to put some uh something in my

98
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:56,399
veins and stick me in some type of a scanner and um I'm like okay well you

99
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:03,160
know this is what's going to happen and and uh so they hook me up with something

100
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:10,160
I don't like to look so I don't know exactly what it was but you know something in my uh arm so that they could insert whatever it was they were

101
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,680
inserting dye presumably and uh the technician the

102
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,079
person that was doing this uh said okay you're going to feel a warm sensation

103
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:27,440
after um I injected this and it's going to feel like you're peeing your pants

104
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,800
you're not in your head you maybe you've had this I'm like okay

105
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,279
whatever I was all interested like wow there's a big machine and I'm going to go in there and you know all this kind

106
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:43,480
of stuff and um they uh injected it and

107
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,680
said okay you're going to feel like you're pee your pants I felt like I was peeing my pants it was quite something

108
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,360
and there was a reassuring me you are not peeing your pants there's like this warm feeling

109
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:04,040
like it just felt like okay this is what it would feel like if one peed their pants and so can you imagine that if I

110
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:10,880
had had that uh experience and assigned this meaning I'm peeing my pants then

111
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,800
there would have been some maybe some humiliation or embarrassment or shame I

112
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,079
don't know what I would have said or done I don't know what I would have done but it would have been a completely

113
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:30,560
different experience than the one that the concept have been giving me it's going to feel like this

114
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,839
the exact same physical experience could be interpreted as oh they just put

115
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:43,360
something in my veins that makes this sensation arise or oh my gosh I'm supposed to be an adult and uh this is

116
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:50,399
happening here and there's these all these people around here too I don't think I can hide this so right the exact

117
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,760
same experience exact same experience can have different interpretations based

118
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,760
on what concepts we're using how how often does this happen in our

119
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,880
lives I can't believe you're late you're always late it means you don't respect

120
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:16,360
me I've had this experience too where I was thinking like I can't believe she's late and you know why I'm this person is

121
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:22,600
always late and don't they recognize you know that I had to go out of my way to be here on time and now I'm having to

122
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:29,399
wait and you know then to hear like um sorry I'm late I actually got a ticket

123
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:36,120
was I was speeding to get there on time but then I got pulled over and so you know it's not because they were

124
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:43,880
disrespectful I had this whole story right about why this person was late but no it was something completely

125
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:51,680
different so we have these ideas we have these

126
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,839
Notions about our

127
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,160
experiences sometimes they're accurate sometimes they're not how do we

128
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:09,759
know how do we know whether they're accurate or not does it

129
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:17,680
matter whether they're accurate or not is it

130
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:25,639
necessary what if I was feeling a little bit irritated that uh this person

131
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:33,320
was late in meeting me and I just know noticed oh yeah I feel some uh

132
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,360
restlessness uh a little bit of agitation thoughts are going a lot

133
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:45,600
pretty fast and a lot of story making is happening and um I'm feeling agitated in

134
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:53,199
my body a little bit it could have just been that instead of having to attribute a whole story to

135
00:14:53,199 --> 00:15:01,800
my friend I could have just been with my experience and then I would have been present for what is actually happening

136
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:09,720
noticing the agitation maybe I could have just said oh yeah feeling agitated feels like this my for me I I don't know

137
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:17,320
why I feel agitation often in my arms and in my legs maybe like there's a feeling of like movement wants to happen

138
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,240
or something restlessness feels like that and that could have been a moment

139
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:31,160
of just being with my experience and I could have felt grounded in my experience restlessness

140
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:37,560
would be happening but there's a way in which just to be present with that experience

141
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,680
without making stories and attributing meaning to it to my friends who happen

142
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:51,000
to get a speeding ticket on the way to see me to meet

143
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,920
me so in the same way when I'm I'm doing guided meditations when

144
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:02,800
I'm leading the meditation I like to use the Expression

145
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,839
like notice or be with or rest the attention on the sensations of

146
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,720
breathing I like to use this expression the sensations of breathing as opposed

147
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,199
to the breath be mindful of the breath be mindful of the sensations of breathing

148
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:29,720
the breath what is a breath really diaphragm can contracts there's a

149
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,120
little bit more space in the plural cavity the lung cavity and the lungs

150
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:43,440
expand so air goes in that's an inhale but what is the

151
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,639
breath is it the movement of the lungs is it the movement of the diaphragm is

152
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:56,360
it the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide is it the feeling of air going

153
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,240
in like what is it the sensations of breathing is more like

154
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,399
getting out of Concepts and ideas and more to the

155
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,120
experience I'm also ofer often offering three different ways to notice the

156
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,520
sensations you could feel the air going in and out of the nose noticing how

157
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,280
often it's cool when it goes in we don't feel it as much when it goes

158
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,080
out because it's the same temperature as the body or we could feel like the ribs or the

159
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:37,919
chest area expanding a little bit maybe the feeling the chest the stretch and then the release of the

160
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,039
stretch or maybe the movement of the belly areas it kind of like moves uh

161
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:49,640
this direction and then another Direction that's the feeling the actual

162
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,600
Sensations is where mindfulness can really help us to make a distinction

163
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:02,919
between the concepts and ideas that we have and what's actually happening and

164
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:09,400
what's actually happening and so the the Mind likes to

165
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,720
this is part of its job it likes to make stories and as ascribe meaning this is

166
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,960
helpful we need this in our daily life but meditation is a time in which we can

167
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,120
put aside or put on the back burner all those things that uh all the spinning

168
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:35,360
that the Mind likes to do and just be with what is and so mindfulness practice is to

169
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,559
just be with the experience and the way that I described for example with the breath but it's

170
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,559
also to notice how our thoughts about our

171
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:54,440
experience is not the same as the experience or the label is not the same

172
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:03,640
as the experience the breath that word the breath is not the same as has a stretching feeling in the

173
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:09,799
ribs and you might wonder well who cares does it

174
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:15,120
matter that there's a that we notice the difference about

175
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:22,799
this well I could say in some ways maybe it doesn't matter in many ways I would say it m it

176
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,880
can make a giant difference sometimes we hear this

177
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,320
expression that but uh in the in Buddhist uh circles or Buddhist uh

178
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,480
scenes actually I've heard it outside in kind of in the secular um area as well

179
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,320
this idea that uh pain is inevitable suffering is

180
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:52,679
optional they're appointing to this exact thing that I'm talking about that okay there might be this

181
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,720
terrible throbbing in the knee maybe it's like this pounding it

182
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,480
feels uh hot and it's kind of this in this vague area it's in the left knee

183
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:10,799
but there's this sense of throbbing with heat that's different than saying

184
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:19,200
there's pain pain is a label is a concept that we're putting on top of it but wow soon as we hear the word pain I

185
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,760
can't be in pain at this I can't sit like this I have to move my body I'm

186
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:30,640
going to damage myself I need to uh uh go to the doctors

187
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,559
after this and make sure that my knee is okay or maybe we hear this word pain and think like oh this is terrible I can't

188
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:42,880
do this and there was that time that I was in terrible pain when I had that

189
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:50,039
accident when I fell off my bike when I was a kid or F fell skiing when I was an adult or you know whatever it might be

190
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:56,360
whenever this word pain we have so many associations with it of course we do

191
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,919
nobody wants to be in pain but when we talk about a throbbing

192
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:08,039
experience that's not it's kind of in a diffuse area on the left knee near the

193
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:14,000
top of the knee then maybe there's a little bit of curiosity with

194
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,600
it and we can say wow this is uncomfortable but is it is it getting

195
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:27,320
worse is it getting better is it moving or is it just in the same

196
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,360
place can can I shift my posture can I move move my knee like this is it still

197
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,559
there right so then we're when we are describing the experience just being

198
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,840
with experience there may still be pain but there isn't the suffering that

199
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,840
starts to go with oh my gosh this reminds me of this and I have to avoid that and I knew I should have never come

200
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,960
to a meditation center they're going to make me being paid or something like this I don't know

201
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,240
we have all these stories we add to

202
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:08,840
things turns out they're extra turns out the stories are

203
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:16,039
extra and so much about this meditation practice is to help us to kind of like

204
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:21,440
tease apart the experience from the

205
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:30,400
stories often the stories is asso assciated with suffering

206
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,640
not always but often there's a way in which the label the concept the that we

207
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:44,000
slap onto our experience often is constricting it's just pain and then

208
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,159
that just becomes this black box that we don't want to go near and feels like we

209
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,480
have to avoid and I just there's so much stuff let so

210
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:01,960
say like with those types of uh without word in

211
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,159
particular now I lost my train of

212
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,760
thought maybe mindfulness helps us distinguish between these between the

213
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,320
thoughts and oh I know where I was going to go here whereas Sensations

214
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:27,159
are just Sensations some of them are uncomfortable some of them are

215
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:33,600
comfortable most of them are completely neutral but there's a way in which if we

216
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,760
can like Focus or tend to Incline towards the sensations then there can be

217
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,000
some curiosity that comes oh wow what is this what's happening like I was

218
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,840
describing with this knee or is it is are the sensations getting

219
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,320
worse are they getting are they moving around or is it just in one small area

220
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:03,039
is it kind of a diffuse area then there's possibility right when we are um

221
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:10,919
being with the experience the sensation then there's a sense of can be onward leading and um something different

222
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:17,760
arising and something new as opposed to pain I have to avoid it this is

223
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:26,440
terrible so when we're with our experience just with the experience and recog we will we will want to assign uh

224
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,679
meaning and labels to them this is what the mind likes to do can we just notice oh yeah that's a

225
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:37,919
label it's provisional this is my current understanding this is what I'm

226
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:44,919
thinking it is without like putting so I have it maybe be more like a Post-It

227
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:50,799
note more than something that's written in a permanent marker you know the label that we're doing it's just like a

228
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:59,200
Post-It note on it something like this because

229
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,600
there's this way that um when we start to make this distinction

230
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,200
between Concepts and and

231
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:18,399
experiences then there's this way in which we can recognize that there's more freedom

232
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:25,200
is available with Sensations we can be with Sensations Concepts often we can

233
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,960
get stuck in them if we use them to Def Define ourselves or to Define others or

234
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:39,120
there's a way in which things get constricted and we have to um manipulate our experiences in order to cram into

235
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:45,320
the ideas we have like you're a bad person but I just saw you do a kind thing oh well you only did that kind

236
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:51,559
thing because uh you must have some malicious intent or something like that or I'm a good person and actually I was

237
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:56,720
just mean to that customer service agent I was yelling at them because they

238
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,399
couldn't answer my question oh but they deserved it you know we make up some story of why we want to preserve the

239
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:10,520
sense no I'm a nice person well we'll just ignore that I was yelling mean things to that customer service

240
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:18,440
person but here's some other things that can happen if we are with our experiences rather than these

241
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,559
Concepts we can be more generous with our assumptions if we're just using

242
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:31,600
Post-it notes I think I think it's like this it's uncomfortable

243
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:39,240
sensation I'm not quite sure about the people that live over there I don't know anybody who lives over

244
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:47,520
there we can be more generous about our assumptions our assumptions about ourselves what we can and cannot

245
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:54,679
handle whether we are a good person or not whether it's important for us to be right all the time sometimes we have

246
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:02,799
these ideas these Concepts about ourselves but if we hold those more Loosely then

247
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:09,679
we can make we can maybe like shift some of these assumptions we have about how we should be how other people should be

248
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:16,600
what their motives are what they should be doing we can be more generous in our

249
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:22,679
assumptions and wow life just unfolds better if we are generous in our

250
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:29,159
assumptions about others and about ourselves we can have this sense of

251
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:36,360
expansive aliveness if we're tuned into our

252
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:43,000
experience while waiting for a friend who is late just being tuned in like oh wow restlessness is happening and some

253
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,799
agitation and it feels like this that's our sense of aliveness

254
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:56,240
there some there's some vitality and like okay this is what it means to be a human who's experiencing some

255
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,919
irritation as opposed to you I can't believe she doesn't respect me you know

256
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:08,399
that's kind of like a it's a limiting and uh

257
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:14,000
constricting as opposed to wow okay so I guess this is what agitation feels like

258
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:23,720
right now this has possibility and it's a this is it's uh inhabiting our

259
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:29,559
life there's also this way if we are paying attention into our

260
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:36,360
experiences or the sensations that we're having the the sights The Sounds the

261
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,840
what's being touched what we hear and taste if we're tuning into the actual

262
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:49,320
Sensations then there's this way that it's easier to start to embrace

263
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:56,320
uncertainty because we start to see that experiences are changing all the

264
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,360
time that's just their nature they're always changing the things that don't

265
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:08,519
change are our Concepts it's just ideas that don't

266
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:13,640
change experiences are changing all the time all the time right this moment

267
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:19,279
you're having bunch of different sounds or you're experiencing your body is

268
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:25,559
experiencing different things as you're moving adjusting your posture maybe of course your thoughts are having lots of

269
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:32,640
different experiences like lots of things are changing so when we start to pay attention to our

270
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:40,240
Sensations rather than just uh Concepts then we just start to see oh yeah things

271
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:48,080
are not certain they change and turns out to be

272
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,559
okay because we're noticing it in a small um scale like what's happening one

273
00:29:53,559 --> 00:30:00,039
moment to the next moment there's so many different experiences being had

274
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:07,200
and then we start to realize oh things really are not as certain as we think

275
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:14,039
they are they just aren't they never

276
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:21,640
were but we want them to be we want to feel like we can control things of course we do of course we want to feel

277
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:30,279
comfortable of course we want the people that we love and care about to be safe and healthy and happy of course we

278
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:35,480
do but we don't get to control nearly what we think we can

279
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:42,600
control have you noticed trying to control somebody else

280
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:50,480
how did that [Laughter] go I was driving with a friend of

281
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:59,600
mine uh not too long ago uh at her car and uh she has uh a

282
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,919
um like a GPS that's giving instructions you know want the next light turn right

283
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:13,120
but this one is extra I don't know what it is it says at the next uh light you know turn right and notice the feeling

284
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:19,880
of spaciousness as you tune into something like this and I found myself getting angry at this think like what

285
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:26,799
don't tell me what to do I felt like this you know this computer AI thing was trying to control

286
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:33,279
my experience you know it it's kind of funny it doesn't we can't control others

287
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:39,240
they get annoyed I get annoyed when people try to control me even when AI is trying to control

288
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,360
me right it doesn't work it just

289
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:51,919
doesn't we need to guide children of course we do I'm not saying just allow anything and everything to happen I am

290
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,159
saying just notice that we don't control nearly as much as we think we do

291
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:03,559
we don't even control ourselves how many of us are exercising the exact right amount we think we should how many of us

292
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:08,639
are eating precisely what we think we should how many of us are meditating

293
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:14,320
precisely the amount we think we should you know all these things right we don't even control ourselves in the way that

294
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:20,760
we wish that we could or think that we should it just doesn't happen there

295
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,519
might be this idealized I what we have about how things should be but those are just

296
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:33,200
Concepts there's just ideas what we have instead are this

297
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,960
experience these Sensations right

298
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:45,440
now so learning to like distinguish the difference between the concepts and

299
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,639
Sensations and choosing to hang out with Sensations which is what mindfulness practice really is

300
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:57,519
about really can support us really in our lives in some ways that uh maybe

301
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,679
aren't w't obvious initially when we think about it or when maybe we took up

302
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:09,720
meditation just thinking we wanted to have some more ease or some uh a little bit more

303
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:17,720
relaxation but there's maybe something El I'll say that be able

304
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,840
to maybe like separate or recognize the difference between the extra labels and

305
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,000
um Concepts that we're adding on top of our Sensations I'm not saying we don't

306
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,519
need Concepts we do need them sometimes we can completely discard

307
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:41,039
them though but what would it be like to use Post-it notes instead of permanent

308
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,760
marker noticing this helps us to understand how we might

309
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:54,240
unknowingly be creating the conditions for our increased

310
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,720
suffering increased difficulties in our lives

311
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:07,360
saying to ourselves you shouldn't do that all I can't believe you did it you're such a fill in the blank the

312
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,440
inner critic that often arises and it's so mean this inner critic can be so mean

313
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,919
right that's extra that's extra but often we don't even know that's extra we

314
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:25,000
don't even we just think it's the truth we just think that because it's familiar perhaps we've heard it a lot that no

315
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,079
this is the way things are

316
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:38,118
so recognizing the difference between Concepts ideas that we're putting on top

317
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:43,878
of our experiences maybe helps us to understand in some of the ways in

318
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:49,960
which the ideas or the concepts that we are using Create the conditions for our

319
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,960
discomfort or suffering or difficulties and it turns out that

320
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:02,280
learning this and looking at look learning this the difference between Concepts and

321
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:10,440
Sensations and choosing to use posted notes for Concepts and tune into

322
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,800
Sensations turns out to be much more reasonable than trying to get the entire

323
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:21,839
world to behave properly so that you can finally be happy so that you can finally

324
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,200
have what you want has anybody tried to uh get the

325
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,359
world just be different than how it is

326
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:39,920
right it doesn't work in the way that we wish it would doesn't mean that we you know shouldn't behave ethically and take

327
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,319
care of others and take care of ourselves it doesn't mean

328
00:35:51,040 --> 00:36:00,599
that so New Years Happy New Years New Years is a concept it's how helpful

329
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:07,720
useful and meditation is a way in which we can really start to get to know what

330
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:14,079
concepts are we using what labels are we using that are extra and not

331
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:20,000
needed or is there a way that we are just living our life in the mind I

332
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,560
certainly did my early life I was very much disconnected I didn't inhabit the body at

333
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,960
all somehow I thought you know well I got rewarded professionally academically

334
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:37,560
for being in my head right chances are many of you did

335
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,839
too but mindfulness practice this invitation to just explore

336
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:53,040
the difference between these two and to tune into the sensations the

337
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:59,880
experiences I'll end there and I'll open it up to see if there's some questions

338
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,318
or comments thank you

339
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:42,359
um I guess this is more of a comment or personal experience I notice sometimes

340
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:49,440
The more I've noticed my thinking I see patterns where I uh am a little

341
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,079
obsessive about situations I can't control

342
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:01,839
and now that I've noticed this more I I do the thing where I go okay so how how

343
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:07,640
does this feel in my body when I'm doing you know and it's like banging my head

344
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:16,599
against the wall it's not going to change with what I'm doing so that's been helpful to kind of go go

345
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:24,040
into the body nice and um and tell myself it's okay to not

346
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,599
think about you know to put it aside what's here what's here right now in the

347
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:38,119
room with me and my physical experience nice nice it's I hadn't really thought

348
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:43,839
about this until more recently but in some ways it's kind of fascinating how

349
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:49,119
we have this idea if I have some internal experience thoughts like

350
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,960
ruminating or just getting a little bit uh compulsive or I think the obsessive was the word that you used in our

351
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,839
thinking somehow we think that our having some interior inner experience is

352
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:06,960
going to change something that's happening not there it's fascinating right how we have this idea so illogical

353
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,520
it's does it's so illogical right but we do it okay if I just worry enough then

354
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:19,280
they'll be safe right or if I get angry enough then

355
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,520
uh they will change their behavior but you know it's just us that's getting angry or something so thank you very

356
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:31,640
much for pointing that out yeah thank you very human right I think all of us do this

357
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:40,760
yeah anybody else have a comment or question or something they'd like to

358
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:55,480
share okay with that I wish you all a Happy New Year and uh it's nice to see

359
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,920
you all and maybe I'll see you next week thank you
