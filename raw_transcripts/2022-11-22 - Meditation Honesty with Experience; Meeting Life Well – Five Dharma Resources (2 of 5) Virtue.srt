1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,640
okay good morning or day or evening

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:13,559
why don't we go ahead and get started for today so we'll begin uh meditating together

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,619
so please settle into your meditation posture

4
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:28,680
maybe just taking a moment to really feel the body and arrive at this place

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:36,079
front of your computer or phone or tablet Wherever You Are and just have a sense that you're here

6
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:44,700
and you're now joining this we can release whatever we were doing to get here

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,480
if possible letting go of things you're thinking about for later

8
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,300
today or things that happened earlier today

9
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,879
things you need to do or want to say

10
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:11,659
or just having a sense of being here with your mind and body as they are

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,880
if you're comfortable doing so or you can close your eyes

12
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,960
feel into the sense of the body sitting or standing or lying down whatever

13
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:33,119
posture you're in and we want to find some kind of balance

14
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,180
in the body when the body is stable and balanced

15
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,060
then that supports that same thing in the mind

16
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,280
so paying some attention to the position of

17
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,979
the head over the Torso

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:03,420
the shoulders balanced and soft

19
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,159
and poised over the hips

20
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:20,060
the place where you're sitting the body rising up straight from that

21
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,640
and generally softening when we have places of tension then we

22
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:36,440
can't as easily find a Natural Balance because things are being held

23
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,300
so softening the jaw the neck

24
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:50,120
shoulders down through the arms and hands

25
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,959
softening the belly and the low back

26
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,980
down into the legs and feet

27
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:16,260
so allowing the straightness of the central part of the

28
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:23,220
body to just be holding the rest which can

29
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,019
soften around it

30
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:45,500
connecting in with a simple object in the present moment such as the sensations of the breath

31
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,620
over the general sensations of the body

32
00:03:53,159 --> 00:04:00,840
more sounds something simple that we can use as a

33
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,400
home base for attention

34
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,039
just inviting ease

35
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,320
in the body and the mind

36
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:34,440
this is a way of just letting go what's right at the surface and is willing to

37
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,639
let go we're not trying to make anything happen or judge that certain things shouldn't

38
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:50,540
be there we just invite some degree of ease

39
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,940
and then I'd like to suggest a certain form of practice

40
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:22,320
that you could try out or do this morning or whatever time of day it is

41
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,139
and if it doesn't work for you that's okay

42
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:35,039
I'd like to suggest What's called the noting practice or labeling

43
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:41,880
where when we feel or sense something in our

44
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:49,740
body and mind we have a gentle one word note of what it is so it

45
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,780
connects us to experience so for example

46
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,479
we might feel warmth and then the next Movement we notice

47
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,580
that you've heard my voice so the note is hearing

48
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,680
and then there's a thought coming through so it's thinking

49
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,919
notes are very simple just expressions of what's happening and

50
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:24,020
doesn't have to be different every moment you could be noting pressure

51
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,979
if your attention is lingering at the place where you're sitting for example

52
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,979
so it's very meant to be very easy a way of engaging part of the thinking mind

53
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:47,220
such that it's not running off the important thing about notes is not

54
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,680
to get hung up on them you make a note and then you wonder was

55
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,919
that the right note or you puzzle over what was that how

56
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,080
should I note that that's already it's already gone on the moment has

57
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,419
already moved on so make a simple note or if you can't think of one you can

58
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:16,800
just say something is an acceptable note

59
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,979
um the only note that I was not encouraged

60
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:29,360
to use is pain because pain is

61
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,039
abstract it's a concept and so we would look for something more

62
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:44,400
accurate and more visceral like hoeing or tension or heat

63
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,620
were stabbing something that conveys the feeling

64
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,860
Okay so what this does is it helps the mind to be clear

65
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,620
connected simply to what is happening

66
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:18,080
I'll have a little more to say in a moment but just try it out for a few minutes

67
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:28,260
foreign that

68
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,700
you put about 90 percent of your attention on the actual experience

69
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,959
and 10 or maybe even only five percent on the Note

70
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:46,320
so it's very light this is not an exercise in

71
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,880
meaning it's just keeping the Mind connected

72
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,019
as we notice how the mind is doing the noting

73
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:54,600
practice one of the things that we can notice

74
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,240
is the tone of voice with which we are noting

75
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:08,839
so is there some subtle judgment in the note is there some subtle wanting

76
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:15,440
climbing toward favoring things that are peaceful or

77
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,980
pointing out things that shouldn't be there it's interesting to hear which voice is

78
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,200
doing the noting and if so that's one more thing to note about judgment is

79
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,620
happening

80
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,360
it's particularly helpful when we can begin to gain some facility

81
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,600
and noting you know emotions and thoughts

82
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,240
so being able to Simply say sadness anger

83
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,839
or joy helps us to not be so reactive

84
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,899
to those response when they're happening

85
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:00,240
and also forms of thought like planning or remembering

86
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,279
we can just say thinking for all of them but sometimes there's a differentiation

87
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,380
into types of thought and again that makes it

88
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,480
less likely that will get on the train and go along with

89
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,660
them

90
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:28,699
but again keeping 90 to 95 percent of attention on the actual experience

91
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,579
foreign

92
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:12,839
worth noting is just one form of practice but I find that

93
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:20,760
it helps my mind to be deeply honest about what is happening in my own

94
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:27,839
experience and practice evolves

95
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:35,399
I think only when we are deeply honest about what's actually happening

96
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:41,399
when we have that level of honesty with ourselves then we become trustworthy

97
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:49,260
stewards of Our Own Heart and our own practice what's really only safe if we can be

98
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:56,040
really open about everything that's coming in the body and the mind

99
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:03,420
so we'll sit in silence for a while now and I'll invite you to either continue with

100
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:09,660
the noting if that was working or to move on to

101
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:17,459
whatever other practice you have but whatever you do to have a commitment

102
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:23,519
to being very honest about what's going on it's all fine

103
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,000
just as you sit here with the body and mind as they are

104
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,900
foreign

105
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:37,760
that seeing is loving

106
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,340
part of what love is is to really see

107
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:51,960
someone or something as it is to just be with that

108
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,179
so there's a way in which this deep honesty about

109
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:08,039
what's really happening in mind and body is a form of loving and hence healing

110
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:15,480
all the parts of our being so rest for a few minutes in the sense

111
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,299
of care that is present in this kind of

112
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:24,559
clear honesty

113
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,200
foreign

114
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:38,340
you know this simple honesty that we cultivate on the cushion

115
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:46,200
can serve us out in the world also the degree to which we have

116
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:53,640
the inner capacity to know our own feelings and responses and

117
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:03,419
thoughts that are coming up as we go throughout the day those help us to respond well

118
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:10,679
we won't say or act on everything that is coming up in ourselves

119
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,840
you know as we talk with someone else we have all kinds of our own feelings and

120
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,840
responses if we have enough mindfulness we can know those

121
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,059
take them in as data um and then choose

122
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:32,960
how to respond clearly and carefully to this other person

123
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:40,740
but if somehow we aren't willing to see everything that's coming up in us if we're blocking some

124
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:47,539
of our own experience that will distort a little bit how we interact with people

125
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:54,539
of course we all do that to some degree because we're not 100 able to see our

126
00:28:54,539 --> 00:29:01,320
minds usually but we do our best and this is an inner form of ethics

127
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,419
and the more that we can be clear about our own experience then

128
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:13,860
the more straightforward and clearly we can walk through the world and that helps everyone

129
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:19,440
it also models for other people a direct and simple

130
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,179
and virtuous way of being

131
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,200
so may our practice support over more inner Clarity and

132
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,158
outer straightforwardness

133
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,278
foreign

134
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,500
[Music]

135
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,630
[Music]

136
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:27,600
this week the theme is called meeting life well

137
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,179
I've Dharma resources and this is to meet life well both on

138
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:39,000
and off the cushion so we're talking about five qualities

139
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,860
upon which the heart draws in order to meet situations whether they are Duca

140
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:53,279
type situations challenging suffering or whether they're What's called nosuka

141
00:30:53,279 --> 00:31:00,539
the opposite Suka type situations of happiness or ease or appreciation

142
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:06,000
and today we are moving on to the second one

143
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,080
which is virtue or ethical conduct you can choose the term within that realm

144
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,299
that works for you the poly word is uh Selah

145
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:23,100
Sila and

146
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:31,380
there's some classical language around this from the sutas so I'll just read it

147
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:38,299
the Buddha says here a noble disciple abstains from the destruction of life

148
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:44,820
abstains from taking what is not given abstains from sexual misconduct abstains

149
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:50,880
from false speech abstains from liquor wine and intoxicants the basis for

150
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:58,500
heedlessness so you can recognize these as I think the I think you can recognize them as

151
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:04,860
the classical language of the five precepts of not killing not stealing not

152
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:11,640
sexual misconduct not lying not intoxicating the mind or the body

153
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,940
so typically lay people would try to live by these principles

154
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:24,000
it's an interesting question though why why we are following the precepts or

155
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,580
some kind of ethical conduct in the world and you know some people do so I think

156
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:35,399
without too much reflection or experiential understanding of what is

157
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:41,279
going on with virtue or silo uh and and in cases like that

158
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:47,039
you know it's just following rules then so the encouragement we have here is to

159
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:53,399
view Selah as a practice and to actually investigate what is going on and you

160
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:58,980
know I'm sure at a top level we've all can see that it feels better and goes

161
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:04,200
better in our life when we you know engage in these kinds of behaviors but

162
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:10,200
there's even more to discover if we investigate what's going on with

163
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:17,159
uh living by these particular actions and it might be that until we do some

164
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:23,460
kind of Investigation in practice in a formal sense with virtue it may not go

165
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:30,299
deeply enough into the heart to serve as what I'm calling a Dharma resource this week which means something that we can

166
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:35,519
rely on to come forth when we meet the world especially if we meet a

167
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,740
challenging situation we want that sense of virtue and

168
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:47,519
understanding of ethical conduct to be rooted deeply enough that it's just what counts for

169
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:54,840
um so what happens when we do some investigation one thing that we'll discover is that

170
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:02,000
acting ethically is more compatible with mindfulness than acting unethically

171
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,040
wholesomeness is pretty easily compatible with awareness whereas

172
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,658
unwholesomeness has a way of obscuring the Mind in a certain way you can check

173
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:18,118
this for yourself so let's consider just the area of wise

174
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:23,580
speech for example so the precept for in particular only

175
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:28,980
mentions false speech but there are expanded descriptions in other areas of

176
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:36,658
the sutas and they expand the description of unwise speech to include speech that is false but also that's

177
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:43,618
divisive or that's harsh or that's meaningless sometimes translated as gossip but I

178
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:49,320
think it goes beyond that um so we'll discover for ourselves we

179
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:56,580
can just observe that when we're speaking well it's pretty easy to stay in attention and to stay grounded in the

180
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:02,599
body and to be relaxed and to be focused on the person that you're speaking to

181
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:08,880
whereas when we're speaking unwisely you know we're lying at that moment or we're

182
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:16,800
speaking harshly or you know not really paying attention then our our inner Vision literally gets

183
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:24,000
kind of occluded in the mind Narrows in and we don't we actually don't Focus as well on the other person I've noticed

184
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,520
that when I've been in situations of somewhat tension with somebody else if I

185
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:36,020
allow myself to get sucked into a sense of aversion or defensiveness I literally

186
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:41,820
feel my attention sort of drawing down and I'm not as connected with the other

187
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:47,880
person this is the effect of of actually an unwholesome pattern in my mind you

188
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:54,660
know it has this impact so most of us have a mindfulness practice if we're sitting here in the

189
00:35:54,660 --> 00:36:01,320
mornings so that means that we value mindfulness in our life that's something that we're trying to cultivate

190
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,599
so in that case it would make sense that we would also be strengthening virtue in

191
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:11,880
order to support our ability to be aware you know when I'm mindful even if it is

192
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:17,339
a tense situation with someone else if the mindfulness is strong enough that in

193
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:24,599
itself is a wholesome quality and I notice that it's easier to be aware and then if I you know if I can in addition

194
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:31,500
try to say something kind try to say something honest about how I'm feeling something like that the mindfulness

195
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,780
stays right there and I can stay in my body so virtue and mindfulness are very

196
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:42,420
connected so this is a deeper reason to practice Selah than just following rules

197
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:48,440
or just doing it because teacher says it's a good idea or something

198
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,460
so then another discovery that we can make through investigation is that

199
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:59,640
virtue is a powerful condition for a kind of happiness that endures even when

200
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:05,280
conditions change so when we're acting and speaking ethically we experience

201
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:13,020
What's called the Bliss of blamelessness in the texts that doesn't mean that we're a hundred percent perfect but at

202
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:19,500
least we know that we were present and we did our best and so there's no basis for feeling guilt or shame or

203
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:24,660
disappointment in ourselves and the world really needs people by the

204
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:30,960
way who have a genuine positive regard for themselves not the fake positive of

205
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,240
denial or ignoring things but genuinely possessed of well-being and ethics does

206
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,520
this for us so again we have a deeper reason to practice ethics we want to

207
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,760
support this let's say loftier form of Happiness that's better than just just

208
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,220
sensual enjoyment so I want to expand a little bit on this

209
00:37:53,220 --> 00:38:00,660
clear link between mindfulness and ethics one time when I was returning from a

210
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:06,300
trip I arrived at the airport at night and at that time I lived close to public

211
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:12,720
transit and I figured on taking the light rail back to my apartment and I

212
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,119
knew that at night the trains only ran about they ran every 30 minutes and when

213
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:24,780
I arrived at the station the train was there and so I hopped on before the doors closed so I wouldn't have to wait

214
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:30,000
in the station for half an hour at night but you can't buy tickets on board and

215
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:38,640
so I was riding without a ticket and I noticed that I felt some mild anxiety about that during the ride but I

216
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,740
did manage to get to my station without the ticket person coming to ask for tickets

217
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:50,579
so in a sense I got away with it but as I exited the train I noticed that

218
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:55,619
I still felt some tension even though the anxiety of getting caught was gone

219
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:00,780
and so I found myself walking to the ticket machine buying a ticket and then

220
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:07,020
throwing it away so that I I had bought a ticket for that ride I didn't think about that I didn't

221
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:12,300
plan it out it just felt natural as I got off the train so mindfulness pointed

222
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:20,460
me toward that particular action and I was willing to follow it to follow the kind of situational ethics of the moment

223
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:28,380
you know because there was you know there's no one making me do that so meeting life well can mean that when

224
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:34,260
we're not sure what to do how to manage a complex situation we can default to

225
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:40,640
whatever develop whatever ability we've developed to serve ethics in the moment

226
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,200
another Buddhist teacher I know calls this serving what is true

227
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:52,680
so rather than gaming all the nuances and possibilities just be aware be clean

228
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:58,079
in how you act or speak and accept any consequences of that as better than the

229
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:04,740
alternative of not paying attention so but what does it mean to be clean in

230
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:10,740
how we act and speak often we think it means keeping principles in mind right I read the five

231
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:17,880
precepts so rules to follow we have these rules to follow and then we figure out how to apply them how to follow them

232
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:25,500
and that's fine that's how we do it a lot of the time but in the moment this might be too slow

233
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:32,160
we can't take the time to go through the cognitive mind if something is coming right in the moment so we need something

234
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:39,359
embodied and it has to be strong enough that it can override any reactive emotions that are coming out like anger

235
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,720
or greed or Envy or fear and so how do we train in that

236
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:52,680
so one way is to trust this connection between mindfulness and doing the right

237
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:58,140
action or the wise action Joseph Goldstein said it this way see

238
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:03,599
what you do or we say see what you say in the case of speech as a way of

239
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,640
exploring Selah so this turns things around sometimes from how we often

240
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,220
practice ethics so you know what we usually do is start from the principle and try to practice

241
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:21,180
doing it so we start from the idea of not speaking falfully and then we willfully try to be true truthful

242
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:26,400
and that's fine but it can be a little bit forced at times or not spontaneous

243
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:34,079
enough um so an alternative is to simply speak as we normally do but be very clear and

244
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,300
precise with mindfulness as we do it and if we start straying into speech that

245
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:45,180
doesn't align with the situation that we're in we'll feel it because we're being mindful

246
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:51,359
so for example if we're if we're listening to a friend talk about a workshop that they attended and we get

247
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:56,460
excited because we've also attended a program on the same topic and then we

248
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:02,579
leap in and we start telling about our knowledge and experience you know we might have assumed that Our intention

249
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:09,359
was wholesome to connect and say something meaningful with our friend but we can feel in the moment that what

250
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:15,720
we're really doing is asserting our own knowledge you know the ego has crept in they're saying they did this workshop

251
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:22,980
and we say oh I know about that too and it's not quite you know it's not quite um it's okay but it's not quite in

252
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:28,800
tune so we can feel that if we're mindful so feeling in our body and mind can be

253
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:35,240
more powerful than if we had controlled our speech from a cognitive place

254
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:42,780
this is something from Ken McLeod who's a teacher in the Tibetan tradition

255
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:49,320
many people try very hard to always say the right thing there's a common misperception that we

256
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:55,380
can know how to say the right thing that we can have it in mind and then when we speak the words will come out correctly

257
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:01,319
this is the common idea of right speech and most of us fail at it over and over

258
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:07,619
again the words don't come out as we thought they would or if they do the tone of voice is wrong or something else

259
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:13,440
happens it rarely goes as we planned that's the point we cannot plan the

260
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,660
future we cannot plan our speech any more than we can plan our next thought

261
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:24,660
how then are we to practice right speech the most effective effort is to listen

262
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:30,000
to ourselves as we are talking this effort brings attention to our speech

263
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,380
when we do this we will hear when what we say doesn't fit the situation when it isn't what we intended to say or how we

264
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:44,760
intend it to say it we will hear with our own ears the different emotional patterns that take over our speech

265
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:50,880
we will hear how what we say doesn't fit with our intention or how it comes out of our confusion

266
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,400
and when we make this effort over and over again we will find that we begin to

267
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,160
speak with attention this is how we practice right speech

268
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,680
and we can do a similar practice for Action like what I did with the Light Rail ticket where I sensed my body

269
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,079
moving to the ticket machine to find the ticket and I thought yeah I could feel in the moment that was a correct action

270
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:18,359
for that moment so ethics or virtue becomes an inner

271
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:25,740
resource or a form of inner wealth or strength when it's freed from the cognitive mind and its focus on ideas

272
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:31,980
and ideals and Abstract principles virtue becomes embodied when we meet

273
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:38,819
life with mindfulness and the intention of non-harm and we let actions in speech emerge from that

274
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:45,060
so it's a training we won't be skilled in it immediately but it takes our ethics training to a

275
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:50,520
deeper level of Dharma practice there's a story from the sutus where the

276
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,680
Buddha is speaking with a prince named Prince Abaya which means Fearless by the

277
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,319
way and he asked the Buddha whether the Buddha plans the answer to Dharma

278
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:07,800
questions in advance and the the Buddha asks in return whether the prince considers in advance

279
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:14,819
how to respond to questions about the parts of a chariot and Prince of Maya says no I'm very skilled in the parts of

280
00:45:14,819 --> 00:45:20,819
a chariot and once someone asks me about that the answer occurs to me on the spot

281
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:27,960
and the Buddha replies so too Prince When people come to me and pose a question the answer occurs to the

282
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:34,500
tatagata on the spot so he's saying that he's understood the Dharma so deeply that he can always come

283
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:41,640
up with an appropriate response so we may not be quite at that level ourselves but I would suggest that we

284
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:48,540
can try taking our ethical conduct to this deeper level through experiential practice and then it will become second

285
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:54,900
nature to speak and act in non-harming ways even in stressful situations

286
00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:02,040
so then it's become a reliable resource in our heart so we have confidence and we have

287
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:09,900
ethical conduct as two resources and we'll keep moving on as we go forward

288
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,039
thank you so much
