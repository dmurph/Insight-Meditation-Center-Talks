1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,359
so hello everyone and welcome to our meditation together

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,080
and um

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,080
i appreciate all the chats and the greetings very warm

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,680
warm very heartening to come here and see them all

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:34,559
so um you know the theme this week is uh the karmic stream and the dharmic stream

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,718
and the two are

7
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,000
related and what i'd like to emphasize for this meditation

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,440
is that one of the one of the physical ways of

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,120
seeing the manifestation of karma or feeling the impact of karma

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,399
is in our in physical tension uh

11
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,439
most as i won't say all most forms of

12
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,720
physical tension that we have is a consequence of the karmic

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,920
activities of the mind the way we hold on to our ideas our

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,439
thoughts our resistances our aversions

15
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,240
and and so as we

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:38,560
relax the body then the more relaxed we become

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,159
while we stay alert and clear then that makes room for the dharma

18
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,280
stream to flow the more tense we are the more we obscure it or

19
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:59,840
lock it from view or or block the stream from flowing

20
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,759
so so part of the advantage of relaxing

21
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,120
is it opens up and allows something to flow something to move through us

22
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,360
something gentle and peaceful something that shows us

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,800
the possibility of living with ease with freedom with calm with

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,319
peace with equanimity uh all these things that are kind of

25
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,680
that clear the channels clear the obstructions from the flow of

26
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,080
life so to relax at the beginning of meditation

27
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,160
is doing much more than just preparing for meditation it's

28
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,319
beginning to shift the karmic stream so that that

29
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,080
so it doesn't interfere with the development of meditation and the development of that dharma

30
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,120
stream so assuming a

31
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,319
meditation posture

32
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,599
and maybe rocking back and forth a bit

33
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,120
and side to side and maybe even forward and backwards

34
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,599
rotating around partly to relax but partly also to kind of

35
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,959
feel your way into your body until you find a posture

36
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,560
that feels balanced aligned alert

37
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:50,000
and part of the advantage if you're sitting upright part of the advantage of that for relaxing

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,760
is that an upright sitting posture has more room for the body the shoulders

39
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,640
to relax and soften if we're collapsed in some way or scrunched over

40
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,879
it makes relaxing more difficult deep relaxation more difficult

41
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,040
sometimes to relax deeply it take has to take a while maybe weeks or months

42
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:22,720
to build up a little strength in the torso too so the strength holds us upright

43
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,400
and allows for this deeper letting go

44
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,400
gently closing your eyes

45
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:44,000
and scanning through the body to see what adjustments can you make now

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,320
to let the body be more at ease is there any

47
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:57,840
tensions or holdings in the muscles that you can relax

48
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,320
maybe in the belly

49
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,880
maybe the shoulders maybe the face

50
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,000
and then to take a few long slow deep breaths

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,840
let the breaths be long that it gets your mind's attention

52
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,759
let the exhale be long enough so that your mind now gets interested in

53
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:08,720
breathing more than interested in its thoughts

54
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,880
and as you exhale can you relax deeply inside

55
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,360
and then letting the breathing return to normal

56
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,319
in a way of attuning yourself aligning yourself with your breathing

57
00:06:52,319 --> 00:07:01,039
every time you exhale for the next little while relax gently relax parts of your body

58
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:08,080
maybe feeling a part on the inhale and relaxing on the exhale

59
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,960
maybe relaxing the muscles around the face

60
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,800
maybe the muscles around the neck maybe there are micro relaxations that

61
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,520
are possible

62
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,479
staying with the rhythm of breathing in and out and as you exhale

63
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,919
relaxing the shoulders

64
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:03,599
relaxing down the arms into the hands those hands become soft

65
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,039
look at the loose hands you might even kind of

66
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,680
move your fingers slightly to loosen them up there

67
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:35,080
on the exhale softening the shoulders

68
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and don't expect that you can relax completely just as

69
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,199
far as it'll go even if it's a micro relaxation

70
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,640
as you exhale soften relax the chest

71
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,959
and relax deep in the heart

72
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,000
soften the belly

73
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:53,399
and down your legs if there's any holding there can you release it

74
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,920
and is there any physical tension

75
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,920
that comes from some mental tension you have mental strain pushing

76
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,680
pressure the pressure to think

77
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:38,040
and as you exhale relax that as well

78
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,640
and then to now settle into your breathing

79
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,079
as you exhale relax the exhale

80
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,720
relax the parts of the body involved in exhaling

81
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,160
as you inhale

82
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,079
can you slightly allow the inhale to be softer

83
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,440
gentler

84
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,240
relaxing softening

85
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,920
and if you find yourself thinking and drifting off in thought

86
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:14,399
let go and as you let go let go back into your breathing

87
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,360
and let yourself be centered

88
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,320
with breathing at the center centered on breathing

89
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:43,600
and with all the relaxation we've done maybe some of the body will feel

90
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,800
the nice flow of energy or nice softness or

91
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,240
and so we're breathing now within a field

92
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,519
that's more relaxed softer flowing

93
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,800
one breath at a time

94
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:57,120
and as we come to the end of this meditation

95
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:08,240
the ability to stay relaxed to be calm can be part of our gift that we

96
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:15,200
provide others if we go through the world anxious

97
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,679
distressed upset in a sense we're teaching the world

98
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,398
that this is a useful way to be

99
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:33,440
if we go through the world at ease or calm or

100
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,320
confident in our ability to meet the world

101
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,840
we have a very different effect on those around us we see this particularly the case with

102
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:53,200
young children and their parents if the parents are anxious it teaches

103
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,600
the children that the world is a frightening place

104
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,960
and to know that we can care for ourselves

105
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:16,360
care for challenges and difficulties so much better if we say come

106
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,240
if we're able to stay relaxed

107
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:30,000
and to offer that to others as a gift that there's a different way of being in

108
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,720
the world that is not anxious is not upset and distressed dismayed

109
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,320
be the kind of person that people relax around feel safe around

110
00:28:53,039 --> 00:29:00,399
and may it be that through this meditation practice we do that our presence in the world

111
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:07,919
is a gift to others it doesn't have to be so conscious

112
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,840
or intentional if we're calm if we're relaxed

113
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,440
just who we are

114
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:26,640
may it be that this practice we do through the practice we do that we're

115
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:35,039
able to make this world a better place may we support the possibility

116
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,320
for all beings to be happy

117
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,559
all beings to be safe all beings

118
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:54,600
to be peaceful and all beings to be free

119
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:04,080
and being relaxed is more likely to support that

120
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,640
than being tense

121
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,549
so [Music]

122
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,158
thank you

123
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,760
so continuing now with this second talk on the karmic stream and the dharmic stream

124
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:52,480
these two major ways in which our lives can unfold and move what moves through us

125
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:59,519
the word uh with these words karma dharma kind of built into the word you get a

126
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:07,039
very different feeling for it um karma has the meaning of action

127
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,080
that's a literal meaning for for for for karma action and with the connotations

128
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:19,600
of making something like constructing something and uh dharma in its root in its uh

129
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:26,000
etymological root comes from the me the meaning of to support

130
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,279
so um the karma implies that we're doing and and

131
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,799
dharma suggested their support

132
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:45,360
and and the dharma stream can provide a tremendous support for us

133
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,720
the karma stream uh the value of that has a lot to do

134
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:58,559
with the nature of the actions we do and um so um

135
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:06,000
and so one of the ways of understanding this uh karma stream the karmic stream

136
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,279
is that it has a lot to do with constructing um that

137
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:17,679
when we act in a certain kind of way we're building creating constructing

138
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:24,320
our response our reactions our character our personality our habit habits

139
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,320
our dispositions all these ways are being kind of we're contributing we're making something

140
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,600
happen and it takes a work the karmic street a karmic stream

141
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,519
requires effort on our part we have to engage in creating it

142
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:48,080
uh and sometimes people are weary and tired from all the constant doing and doing and doing that

143
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,279
they do living this karmic stream of actions and reacting

144
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,880
acting and reacting the dharma stream

145
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,279
because it succumbs more of a support it it it doesn't require the same kind of

146
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:11,039
action there might be things we do in a sense movements we make things we say

147
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:17,760
but it doesn't come from this impetus this forcefulness of um of making something

148
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:25,120
it maybe comes more from something that's being expressed rather than holding something up

149
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:32,080
we're being held up and um and so the uh the um

150
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,840
so the the karma stream is uh tends to be much more volitional

151
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:45,200
intentional like this is where we're just pretty kind of disposed to do something to make something happen

152
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,120
and and we can see that in our thinking

153
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,360
and there may be an easier way to kind of see it is if you use the principle that

154
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,399
if you're thinking about anything that's not in the present moment

155
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:08,240
your mind is uh is constructing the memory the fantasy

156
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,679
the future and in that construction there's an impetus there's a maybe even a

157
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,280
compulsion to have something happen to want something to not want something to like

158
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,358
something not like something and and that impetus

159
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:31,279
that creation and that force behind it sets

160
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,638
kind of creates the nature of that action and the nature of the action creates

161
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:45,118
what impact it has in the future so if we act with greed

162
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,480
um and that's kind of you know that what goes behind the thinking and then the acting

163
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,638
that has a very different uh creates a very different momentum in our

164
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,240
lives than if we act out of generosity if we chronically act out of aversion it

165
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,480
creates a very different momentum in our lives than if we act out of love

166
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,400
and so to think of karmic stream is something that's being construed always being

167
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,560
constructed built and sometimes in english we think of karma

168
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:27,680
as the results of our actions and the in pali it's a different word vipaka

169
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,839
or that means the results the emphasis on karma the buddhist

170
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:40,160
emphasis on karma is on the act of constructing and so we see in the teachings of the

171
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,440
buddha less interested in understanding why something happens

172
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,760
you know something happened and now can it must be my karma in the past people say

173
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:59,119
that's not very interesting for the practitioner of the dharma rather what's interesting is

174
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,800
given what's happening no matter what it's whatever is happening what is the action

175
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,160
reaction with which we're meeting that or responding to that

176
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:16,880
the focus is on what we're doing in the present not the reason why the present is happening

177
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:24,320
that's valuable at times to look at the reasons in the background but for to really get to the heart of this

178
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,920
the karma teaching is to learn how to

179
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,040
act differently in the present moment

180
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,720
where the where the choice is to construct things a little differently

181
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:47,119
and and so they had what's useful is that if you're interested in

182
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:53,040
the dharma the dharm extreme if you're interested in freedom if you're interested in this phenomenal

183
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,560
inner goodness that comes with the dharma stream that

184
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,880
you want to act accordingly you want to act and do things that support that possibility that lead in that direction

185
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,800
and so generosity ethics kindness compassion

186
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,280
um equanimity letting go these are all actions that are constructing kind of a better self a

187
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,440
better disposition a better kind of stream of momentum in us

188
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,560
that uh is supportive of the dharm extreme

189
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:36,400
and so to some degree uh if we're living in the karmic world where we're choosing

190
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:44,240
the particular actions that we want to live by that those we have a sense are wholesome beneficial

191
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:51,440
useful and we're learning to let go of those which are not useful it turns out that all the unuseful ones

192
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,880
the ones that are create a negative impact on us

193
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:04,400
they all come with tension of some kind or other and that tension has an ongoing momentum

194
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,920
that compulsion has an ongoing momentum in our lives when we do

195
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,960
beneficial karma it might have tension it might not it might have a compulsion it might not

196
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,160
and that's a very important distinction because if doing good things is done with

197
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,320
tension the results are mixed if we do good things without compulsion

198
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,160
without tension the results tend to be better and the results here we're talking about

199
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,680
not necessarily the results out in the world but the impact it has in us inside

200
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,440
the impact in in the ongoing momentum disposition um

201
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,078
that through which we act and respond to the world

202
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:56,480
the dharma stream is mostly something that we allow

203
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:03,200
we don't construct it it's mostly getting out of the way it's clearing this the blockage in the

204
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,839
stream um and the karma stream we're learning to turn

205
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:17,280
off the fire hose in the dharma stream we're removing the

206
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,720
the obstacles that keeps the stream from flowing

207
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:30,880
and uh and the um and uh and then uh this um

208
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,400
because we're not acting with tension then uh dharma stream is to learn to relax

209
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:43,359
deeply and we're letting go and if we're not acting out a compulsion or attention

210
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:50,240
we're not really going to be creating this negative karma instead we'll create

211
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,760
instead will allow for the native goodness inside of us

212
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:02,160
the love the generosity the caringness the the kindness

213
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,200
there's all this wonderful good qualities we have including wisdom

214
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,359
including kind of strong wisdom and strong compassion and strong

215
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:18,480
adherence and dedication to the truth as strength that is

216
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:25,040
stable and strong partly because it's not agitated or fragile that the way that tension can

217
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:31,920
cause and so um and so uh what's interesting is that

218
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:38,480
when we do the kind of dharmically positive activity

219
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,000
actions that are part of the construction process

220
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,839
conditioning process that that it aligns itself

221
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:57,680
with this goodness that's inside and there's start and it becomes a time when there's a transition

222
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,040
from what we're doing to what we're allowing what we have to contribute

223
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,480
to what we are and so this inner goodness

224
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,880
as as we do good in the world do good for ourselves it tends to

225
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:23,839
support the awakening or the freedom or the expressivity of the dharma stream inside of us

226
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:29,040
and the dharma stream is manifested in many ways

227
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:35,760
but it's manifested with a tremendous confidence and trust

228
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,440
in joy and tranquility and happiness

229
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,560
an ability to be settled and focused in equanimity

230
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,200
and ultimately in freedom and so

231
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,640
one of the things we learn this is a very important distinction between this dharma stream and the

232
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,960
karmic stream because it helps us to see that we don't have to

233
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:11,599
always be constructing our world constructing our responses to the world we're not the work of reacting and

234
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:18,240
acting and doing and thinking and one of the primary constructive activities people are doing

235
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:24,800
is through their thinking it's a lot of work and thinking and it's constructing it's manufacturing

236
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:31,359
ideas fantasies stories interpretations of what's there and it's a tremendous burden

237
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:38,240
if it's just done incessantly and compulsively and it's not necessary to do as much as

238
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,240
most people think the authority behind our thinking can be questioned

239
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:51,760
and it's a little bit like um someone uh maybe you live in your you know someone lives in a home for years

240
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,800
and they've accumulated a lot of things and furniture and stuff and they live in this home

241
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,440
and it turns out that there's a wall down the middle of the home and half the home

242
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,560
they didn't know was there and then someday someone takes down the wall and they realize wait a minute

243
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:15,040
there's a whole second half of the home so to understand this distinction between

244
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:21,359
the karmic stream and the dharma stream is can be kind of like aha

245
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:28,160
oh there's a whole second half of how to live you'll still live in the karma stream to

246
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,880
some degree but hopefully you live it with wisdom and clarity and just understand how it works

247
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:41,280
and there's this whole other room to live in that gives you breathing room and space and freedom

248
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,040
and that's the other half that's often missing for people who live only in the

249
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,720
karmic world which is most people and so discover the dharma world the

250
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:59,359
dharma stream is a great gift and a great

251
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:05,880
it was just a wonderful thing so um

252
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,960
so we'll continue over these next days on this theme and hopefully as we continue you'll get a better sense of

253
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:22,440
this distinction and how to practice and work with it thank you very much
