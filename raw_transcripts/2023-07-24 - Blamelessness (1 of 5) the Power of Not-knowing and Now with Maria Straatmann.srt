[Music]

57
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:44,059
ah so welcome everyone

58
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,399
my name is Maria strotman and I'm sitting in for Gill this week

59
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:58,020
um I am just here just me

60
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:05,279
I have been many things in my life I've done many things in my life I've been a scientist a businesswoman

61
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:11,640
I've been retired for some time I've been with IMC for 25 years plus

62
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:18,980
I've done any things with IMC I've been a hospice worker

63
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:26,940
I've been mentally inclined I've been filled with my heart as of all of us

64
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,740
we've been many many many things

65
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:37,140
one of the things I'm doing now is I organize the online group practice

66
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:45,140
discussions and offer them a couple of times a week although that's changing but

67
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:50,279
that's been wonderful to share with people the Dharma I love the Dharma I

68
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:55,760
love talking about the Dharma I love living the Dharma

69
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,480
I asked some people what do you think you'd like to hear what would you like to to have as a topic

70
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:10,320
and I got a couple of a couple of suggestions one of which was something about Ai and you know what I discovered

71
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,720
is that everybody has an opinion about artificial intelligence and I'd be spending all my time talking about what

72
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,940
it was and so I'm not doing that but there was another suggestion that

73
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,640
had to do with how do I deal with self-blame and

74
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:33,480
self-criticism and since that's been up for a lot of people lately that I've talked to

75
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:40,640
and is something that we all grapple with I thought maybe that's what we'd talk about we're going to talk about

76
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:46,679
self-blame self-criticism but I wanted to do it by by calling the whole topic

77
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:52,500
blamelessness discovering and recovering blamelessness

78
00:32:52,500 --> 00:33:00,059
and the shift is one of energy it's not something I have to fight about but rather something

79
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:08,600
I want to embody in my life blamelessness it's lighter somehow

80
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:16,919
if you've ever been plagued by self-criticism you know that it's very tight and heavy and it's a truly

81
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,518
burdensome

82
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:32,279
what we're going to do over the course of this week is talk about several ways into that

83
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:41,360
why why do we engage so much in self-criticism what are the elements of it and how can we become less

84
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:48,179
affected by that criticism that voice in our heads that say you're not good

85
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:54,000
enough you should be better you should have not done that you shouldn't have been that way how come I can't let go of

86
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,659
that why can't I let go of that I don't really want to be that way

87
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:07,639
and all of these are arguments taking place in the head so

88
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,220
one of the tools that I use one of the mantras that I use is the opening to the

89
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:20,878
dhamapata I want you to think about this week that

90
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:28,020
this weekend have it in your heads all experience is preceded by mind led

91
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:33,300
by mind made by mind speaker Act

92
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:38,700
with a corrupted mind and suffering follows like the wheels of

93
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:46,618
the cart behind the Hooves of the ox all experience is preceded by mind led

94
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:52,500
by Mind Made In My Mind speaker act with a peaceful mind and

95
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:58,500
happiness follows like a never departing shadow I like the fact that the happiness thing

96
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:05,460
comes later because I can kind of take let the breath out you know I said the corrupted mind the mind that says no no

97
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,060
no what about what about what about has tightness and and the energy of

98
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:17,640
contraction around it and the peaceful mind has the energy of ease and openness

99
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:24,540
and lightness and it leads to happiness like a never

100
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:31,099
departing Shadow wonderful I'm there I want to do that

101
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:38,880
in order to to Grapple with why it is that we get tied up in self-criticism

102
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,579
there are three things that are important to keep in mind one is

103
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:49,740
we don't know what's actually going to happen because there's an element of

104
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:55,680
self-criticism that has to do with I'm sure I know what's going to come next it's always going to be this way I know

105
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:04,200
that this this is what comes from that so so the attitude of not knowing

106
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:10,400
is kind of an antidote to the I know I know this is the way I am

107
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,660
not knowing not knowing

108
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:21,240
impermanence it's changing all the time

109
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:26,520
I was talking to someone the other night and they said given what you just told me why are you

110
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:32,880
smiling I said because I'm because right now everything's lovely because right now I'm speaking to you and my heart is

111
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,040
light and I'm smiling I don't have to carry everything from my

112
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:44,280
past into this moment I can just be in this moment the impermanence has to do

113
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:50,339
with just being here in this moment I don't have to worry about what's

114
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:55,380
ending and what's arising I can just see this

115
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:01,020
what's the attitude in my heart right now is it tight oh

116
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:06,780
I can feel the dis the distancing from that the desire to distance myself from

117
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:12,260
that and not self

118
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:19,820
all of the things we believe are true about us are just one thing

119
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:26,119
we are not the same people we were we're not the same people we were a moment ago

120
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:34,320
a moment ago we were tied in something else now we're tied or loose here

121
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,359
improvements impermanence

122
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:46,020
we can be born into every moment every moment is a new moment

123
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:53,000
but then I think about how much courage it takes to be completely present

124
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,579
to feel safe enough not to hide behind the vigilance of

125
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:07,160
needing to be different or the vigilance against that condition

126
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:13,220
or admitting we may not know the outcome of something

127
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:20,299
we may not know what that person is going to do we may not know how we'll feel about something tomorrow

128
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:27,500
we may not know it takes courage to be completely present

129
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:39,720
you know I I was visiting my grandson a few weeks ago he's three okay so you

130
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:45,839
have a little three-year-old if any of you have three-year-olds in your life or recall three-year-olds in your life you

131
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:52,200
know that they are not particularly rational although they you get used to talking to

132
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,599
them and you think oh yeah they know exactly what I'm saying so I got engaged in this conversation with them because

133
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,540
we were putting together some snacks to go on a trip and I was going to stick him in my purse and I had this little

134
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:09,060
dish that had the snacks in and I found a lid that fit on that and he said no no

135
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:14,640
we can't have that and I said no it's okay and he says I can't drink out of that and pretty soon he was screaming

136
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:20,040
and shrieking and I have this hearing aid that increases high frequency sounds

137
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:28,740
because that's where my hearing's loss is and a three-year-old shrieking in that ear is painful and and trying to

138
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:34,560
explain to them but you don't need to drink out of this lid we're just using it as a lid no no I can't

139
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:41,700
I can't have that and I thought what am I doing arguing with a three-year-old it must be crazy and so I walked away I

140
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:49,380
just walked away never underestimate the value of temporarily walking away

141
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:55,079
and I thought okay he can't reason his way to this what is it that's bothering

142
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:01,680
him he can't drink out of the lid okay so I went back to him and I said I'm going to

143
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,619
take this seal off the top oh okay

144
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:12,960
I had to actually hear that he couldn't drink out of a cup the fact that he

145
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,660
wasn't going to drink out of the cup was totally irrelevant when we were trying to argue ourselves

146
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:25,380
out of something we're just like that we're busy saying but I know that won't

147
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:33,720
work that won't work and we're not hearing what is it we're not seeing what is it

148
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:39,839
that I'm actually protesting against is it

149
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:47,820
my fear of being seen a certain way is it my fear that I'm not worthy is it my

150
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:55,079
fear that things are going to happen enough of my control am I worried about being taken advantage of what's

151
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:03,420
underneath that criticism of me what's underneath it what is the place

152
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:08,640
that is close in to me that I'm experiencing that I am

153
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,640
my mind habit reflecting out as I just can't I just I just can't do this it's

154
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,480
all my fault it must be my fault if it's unsatisfactory it must be my fault

155
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,300
who says it's just unsatisfactory

156
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:37,619
it's the tendency that we as humans all have to sort of wrap things up and make them work

157
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:43,800
if if there's something coming at me that's painful I have to I have to take care of that I have to organize it I

158
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:50,180
have to control it because I don't feel safe

159
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,300
somewhere is the trigger that says I'm not feeling safe

160
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:04,280
and somehow it gets translated into why can't I be better

161
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:12,300
and what I'm saying is it's better to just be you whatever you are however you

162
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:19,920
are in this moment not who you were yesterday or last year and mind habits over the course of a

163
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,140
lifetime become incredibly strong and we believe them just as we believe

164
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:34,079
our thoughts but just as we don't really know

165
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,960
I want to remind you that life is not a ledger it's not like we line up all the good

166
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:45,540
things we do against all the bad things we do and if the bad things outweigh the good things then we're good we're bad

167
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:50,000
or vice versa life is not a ledger

168
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:58,079
all experience is preceded by mind led by mind made by mind

169
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:04,338
speaker act with a corrupted mind and suffering follows

170
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:10,200
be correct with a peaceful mind and happiness follows

171
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:16,800
like a never departing shadow so when you find yourself tied up

172
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:24,000
and trying to argue yourself out of something let go of all of the mental activity

173
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,940
around that just walk away temporarily

174
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:37,519
take the lid off and say what am I really feeling right now

175
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:46,099
just be you here the you that is here now

176
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:53,420
and just for that moment you are completely safe

177
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,599
no a moment of being safe

178
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:08,599
because like all practice it's cumulative it's cumulative

179
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,920
it comes and the more we notice the more often we

180
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,099
notice the more easy it becomes

181
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:29,000
so I have a little poem to read you in this last moment

182
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:32,838
I hope

183
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:41,579
I put on again the vest of many pockets easy to forget which holds the reading

184
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:46,859
glasses which the small pen which the house keys the compass and whistle the

185
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:54,660
passport to forget at last for weeks even the pocket holding the day of digging a place for my sister's ashes

186
00:44:54,660 --> 00:45:01,560
the one holding the day where someone will soon enough put my own to misplace the pocket of touching the

187
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:07,260
walls that Auschwitz would seem impossible it is not

188
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:12,720
to misplace for a decade the pocket of tears I rummage and rummage transfers

189
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,180
from Munich from Melbourne to Oslo a receipt for a Singapore kepi a device

190
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:24,480
holding music Bach Garcia Richter Porter part a woman lawn dead now gave me when

191
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,819
I told her I could not sing a kazoo now in a pocket

192
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:37,140
some wear a pocket build holding a Steinway somewhere a pocket holding a packet of salt

193
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:44,280
where gazian vest Oxford English Dictionary vest with the magnifying glass tucked inside one stabbed closed

194
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:50,760
pocket Wikipedia vest Rosetta vest Enigma vest of decoding how is it one

195
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:58,440
person can carry your weight for a lifetime one person slip into your open arms for a lifetime

196
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:05,300
who was given the world and hunted for tissues for chapstick

197
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:13,920
let your life be like that open vest the memories are fine but they're not

198
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:20,280
who you are the route to blamelessness the root to

199
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,500
blamelessness is through allowing you to be just who

200
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:31,760
you are now not the person tucked away in a pocket

201
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:38,480
thank you may you be at ease with who you are

202
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:46,140
so if anyone has any questions or comments I'm happy to hear them

203
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:51,720
hey thank you Maria um so if anyone has anything in uh any

204
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:58,680
questions from Maria you can go ahead and raise your hand and call on you and in YouTube If you have our YouTube

205
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:04,460
viewers regarding poster questions in chat and

206
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,000
pulls into Mia

207
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:21,900
so Maria just uh as a initial question like you know I've heard that you know with adults uh taking a break for like

208
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:28,740
20-25 minutes is usually appropriate um you know when you want to walk away for three-year-olds what would be your

209
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:33,780
uh estimated well you know three three-year-olds are

210
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:41,819
great because they give up the moment so easily they haven't got an accumulated history and so they actually I I went

211
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:47,180
back to him oh I don't know about three minutes later

212
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:52,859
and said oh I've taken the lid off the top the seal off the top and he said oh great

213
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:59,160
they really have the ability to come right back oh okay so maybe it's like uh uh

214
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:04,980
the number of minutes you take the break is like equivalent to the age of the person you're dealing with it can be but

215
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:11,880
not necessarily okay I I use this actually when I find myself in conflict with my husband

216
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:17,339
I have this great story where I was I had been on a diet it was a very restrictive diet and I had to eat and it

217
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:23,760
was really and eat at regular intervals and I was really really hungry and he had this elaborate plan for

218
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:30,380
dinner and I kept saying no no I'm hungry I'm hungry and I realized I was hypoglycemic and I was

219
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:35,520
rational and I left the room and I came back

220
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:41,339
and immediately we were in it again I went out of the room I came back I had to come back three times the third time

221
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:49,200
he handed me a carrot which was perfect and then it was over so it isn't it it's

222
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:55,560
just it's a pause it's a it's a break it's a break in the habit actually it's

223
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:04,079
a break in the intensity that you're looking for sure is that time related or it's but it

224
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:11,940
is related to being aware of what's going on great well thank you um Marlene has her

225
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:18,420
hand Reese so uh Marlene you can go ahead and unmute hi Maria hi everyone

226
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:24,960
um I'm gonna try and get to my question Maria it's pretty convoluted because this is a very

227
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:31,760
fraught topic for me um as you have some understanding of since I've spoken to you a few times

228
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:40,760
fear is an overwhelming consuming Motion in my life and um

229
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,280
I find myself trying to focus and be aware of what I feel in the moment

230
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:55,260
what's happening in the moment since that's all we really have that we can focus on with any reliable sense of

231
00:49:55,260 --> 00:50:01,920
reason um and then I find myself going into

232
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:08,520
projection about this could happen in the future this could happen and I have no way of knowing what could happen or

233
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:13,560
what could not happen based on the past though I would say talk about

234
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:19,640
impermanence being Illustrated and glaring reality

235
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:25,740
constantly over and over again everything is subject to change at a moment's notice

236
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:33,300
or no moments notice um so what am I trying to get to

237
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:39,420
I'm trying to I I'm trying to figure out what do I want

238
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:45,839
who do I I mean that's a huge question I know we'll see so here maybe maybe this

239
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:52,619
will help you know one of the one of the one of the things we often find when we're tied up in mental habits is that

240
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:58,380
there is some fear this may happen this may not happen and arguing ourselves out

241
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:03,839
of it will not help so I remember one time being in a very fearful situation where I thought it was going to fall off

242
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:10,559
the side of a mountain and I'm terrified of heights and I said you know you're a good Buddhist

243
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,720
you know that this is temporary you don't have to believe these stories none of that was working

244
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:23,339
and I said okay I'm afraid and allowing myself to be afraid was

245
00:51:23,339 --> 00:51:29,280
freed me from having to justify being the fear I didn't have to justify why I

246
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:35,160
was afraid I just said I'm afraid and as soon as I was able to accept fear

247
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:41,220
is here then I said so what are you afraid of well I'm afraid I'm gonna fall off the mountain

248
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:46,380
and it was easy from there to say well I will either fall off the mountain

249
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:52,140
or not fall off the mountain but the one thing I'm sure of is I can't stay here

250
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:57,660
yes that's a very good point okay so it's it's first you have to say

251
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:03,480
this is what's here anger is here fear is here uncertainty is here you have to

252
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:09,480
have the courage to say I don't know how to fix this right now

253
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:15,000
but this is here this is here this pain this this anger

254
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:22,140
this whatever it is so what are my choices given that this is

255
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:27,359
true now what given that this is true now what

256
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:32,880
and and try to stay in the moment and not in the future but just here given

257
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:40,619
that I'm scared to death I choose not to Die In This Moment

258
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:47,040
and move on it's you not only can walk out of the

259
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:54,180
room but you can stop thinking about stop turning turning it over turning

260
00:52:54,180 --> 00:53:01,160
turning let just okay

261
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:07,500
and what you discover when you're paying attention to that corrupted mind idea is

262
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:15,960
that the fear is not as corrupted as the fighting around it is not as tense and as structured as the

263
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:24,980
fighting it the some of the fighting is creating the very energy that you'd like to let go of

264
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:34,020
so we train ourselves not to be afraid of what is here

265
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:42,720
but to say this is Pleasant this is unpleasant I neither have to like it or not like it

266
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:49,740
I can just say here is this to know the nature of it is to free us

267
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:57,420
from having to choose or not choose it there's a nature of it

268
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:03,660
did you say that last sentence one more time please to know the nature of it is to free

269
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:09,559
oneself from the need to choose it or not choose it

270
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:18,318
to let go of the struggle against it or for it

271
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:25,039
allows us to be present for joy and present for pain

272
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:31,500
I think I'm still crawling but I'm making some progress thank you very much

273
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:39,780
aren't we all Maria there were a couple questions on

274
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:46,079
uh from our YouTube viewers as well as on Zoom about the title of the poem and

275
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:52,500
the poem this is invest by Gene Hirshfield so it's Jane hirschfield the

276
00:54:52,500 --> 00:55:00,900
best it's from her latest book called The Ledger I'm a big fan of Jane hirschfield so and

277
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:06,780
that was called the vest thank you uh really give more

278
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:16,319
information than that but I ran out of time sure sure um Kane on YouTube asked uh Maria can

279
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:22,260
you please talk on societal self-criticism I guess the difference between critique

280
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:29,400
and criticism as some criticism can lead to better ideas or disbanding old held

281
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:34,579
assumptions for example women's rights around the world

282
00:55:34,579 --> 00:55:40,980
Okay so so it's important to distinguish between

283
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:48,319
um let's see how can I put this um

284
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:56,700
I was going to talk about something that I think is actually Your Role but directly to the question so I'm resorting in my head so so it is the

285
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:03,960
difference between discernment and blame discernment and blame so

286
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:11,420
so excuse me to take for example

287
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:18,440
um women's rights I was a

288
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:24,300
person in in high tech business for most of my business life

289
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:30,240
and I ran it and I was often the only woman in the room and to maintain my

290
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:37,440
place in the room was sometimes very difficult and to not have to be something I was not was

291
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:43,800
very difficult and I'm very uh aware of the stress that

292
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:50,400
can arrive arise from women's rights and myself I'm a very

293
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:58,559
strong proponent of women's rights and at a time in my life I developed a

294
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:05,339
horde a bag of anger over that that I carried around with me that could be

295
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:12,900
triggered at any moment and this was not only unhealthy but it was part of the corrupted mind that was

296
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:19,920
keeping me in the world of suffering I have not given up

297
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:25,020
standing up for women's rights or supporting organizations that are

298
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:31,440
defending women I have stopped

299
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:37,039
feeding my own anger to justify my position

300
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:45,300
so the difference in criticism and critique is that criticism says it's

301
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:50,460
your fault which is irrelevant to actually solving the problem I don't

302
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:58,020
have to place lame I just have to deal with the Injustice

303
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:06,180
and do something about the injustice I don't have to build up the history of hate that is related to it's your fault

304
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:11,400
or it's my fault I don't have to replace

305
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:16,920
discernment with blame in order

306
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:24,839
to improve conditions in life so I hope that answers the question

307
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:31,559
yeah I guess it kind of sounds like that Razors Edge between like reflection and rumination or something yeah yeah very

308
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:39,420
good observation thank you uh Roxanne has um uh just to be who you

309
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:44,760
are that's the question who am I how do I know who I am so I think that's

310
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:50,880
something that I think everyone has had to deal with at some point like how I guess

311
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:57,660
who am I so the the most important part of that question is the question itself

312
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:03,299
who am I not knowing is really important

313
00:59:03,299 --> 00:59:09,960
so in order to know who you are

314
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:16,200
one needs to be in touch with what am I experiencing now

315
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:22,920
and what are the reactions of now and what are the the sensitivities of

316
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:29,280
now it isn't what you do for a living or how

317
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:34,740
you spend your time or the causes you believe in

318
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:39,980
those are consequences of who Who You Are

319
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:47,400
when I say to just be you what I mean is

320
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:53,880
that it's not necessary for you to become someone else to be free of suffering

321
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:59,900
you don't have to achieve the ideal whatever that is

322
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:09,180
you just need to be here with this with the uh the honesty to be truly present

323
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:15,079
with what's here so if I am at the moment

324
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:21,500
resentful I need to be able to see resent

325
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:30,180
and say oh I'm sorry you're feeling that way Maria because it doesn't feel good and and do

326
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:35,460
I have to tell myself the story to justify that resentment to keep it there

327
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:43,079
yes I do and so I can stop the story I don't have to condemn the resentment

328
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:52,260
I can stop defending it who I am is the person who is in this

329
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:57,020
moment grappling with whatever is true In This Moment

330
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:03,540
and it is a result of the conditioning I've had my whole life

331
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:09,180
thank you all of the events I remember and don't remember

332
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:14,940
and the conditions of this moment over which I have very little control

333
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:20,339
the conditions of this moment one might say none

334
01:01:20,339 --> 01:01:28,140
so where is the blame what we have are is our intentions and

335
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:33,798
what we do next and what I hold in my heart

336
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:42,200
so know what you're holding in your heart thank you

337
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:50,900
if I could give voice to just what's true for me now what would the voice sound like

338
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:58,020
would it be harsh would I shy from it would it be light

339
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:01,160
just know it

340
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:06,140
see it clearly

341
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:15,960
I want to ask myself that question for a month long retreat who am I and I've got

342
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:21,540
a lot of answers and at one point I there was a conversation going on my

343
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:27,059
head this person was saying this and this person was saying this and running and it was going back and forth and then

344
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:33,720
there was another voice that said shut up and I said to myself

345
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:40,279
who am I all of these voices

346
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:57,798
we are not the voice in our head

347
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:07,079
so kind of keep that in mind also I hope that helps I'm sorry if I

348
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:12,180
would take a longer conversation conversation to actually know if it's

349
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:17,880
helpful hey thank you Maria and then uh Charles

350
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:24,240
Lee just had a uh a quote I think is related to the uh uh critique criticism

351
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:31,559
um this is from Tony Morrison uh the function the very serious function of racism or any systemic bias is

352
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:38,160
distraction keeps you from doing your work keeps you from explaining over and over again your reason for

353
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,338
being

354
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:50,099
repeat the first part of that place it's the Tony Morrison quote Yeah

355
01:03:50,099 --> 01:03:55,440
yeah from Charlie uh the function the very serious function of racism or any

356
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:01,680
systemic bias is distraction uh it keeps you from doing your work it keeps you from

357
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:06,500
explaining over and over again your reason for being

358
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:11,780
yeah it

359
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:18,839
significant that one does not see whatever pause one

360
01:04:18,839 --> 01:04:25,920
has ignoring what is true or walking away from what is true or

361
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:31,940
walking away from what one sees or the discomfort of the moment

362
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:43,220
the quality of

363
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:52,260
seeing what is perhaps

364
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:57,480
un uncomfortable for us or unpleasant for us

365
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:04,140
contains a message that says I can get distracted into

366
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:13,760
arguing about this or I can live my life in a full and open way that sees that

367
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,200
and works within it

368
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:25,920
to right wrongs to live my life free and openly and not to be

369
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:31,039
actually constrained by all the things that I believe

370
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,480
it's a very interesting quote Charles Lee thank you

371
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:51,180
yeah and I think finally uh Marlene has her hand up again so Marlene you can go ahead

372
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:57,780
oh thank you um I wanted I really loved that quote that

373
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:03,900
you that you read Maria about um speak with a with a corrupted mind

374
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:12,240
and suffering follows um speak with a with a peaceful mind peaceful mind and

375
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:18,900
um basically happiness follows

376
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:25,819
so um I certainly believe that speaking with

377
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:32,720
Equanimity and peace in your heart um is

378
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:39,240
the way to go to to trying to move forward to understanding to getting things done to

379
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:46,079
to having something to talk about and knowing what to do about it but if

380
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:53,720
you're if you're dealing do you have any suggestions for how to

381
01:06:54,180 --> 01:07:02,520
um how to how to speak with someone how to get to the point with someone who

382
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:06,980
lives in the state of anger

383
01:07:13,859 --> 01:07:20,880
um just as you can't talk yourself out of anger you can't talk someone else out of

384
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:27,240
anger nor do you have a responsibility to talk them out of anger but I recently met

385
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:33,240
with a friend who was very angry and had indeed turned some of her grief

386
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:41,700
at losing her husband into anger towards other people who justifiably were

387
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:47,640
her her anger could be justified by the unfairness that was she was being met

388
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:53,400
with but as she was speaking I said

389
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:58,859
she said she said something like uh I guess uh I've just been naive

390
01:07:58,859 --> 01:08:05,579
in trying to be open with them and I said because they

391
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:11,760
are as they are does not mean that you have to stop being as you are

392
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:20,640
you don't have to give up being a warm and open person in exchange in

393
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:26,699
order to fight against them you can still be the warm person that

394
01:08:26,699 --> 01:08:33,600
you are the warm and generous person that you are you can just stop being generous to them

395
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:41,758
but you don't have to fight them or develop anger in your heart that is not

396
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:47,640
consistent with your own intentions in life you don't have to criticize your

397
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:54,719
own generosity because of how it's being met you hold on to just Who You Are

398
01:08:54,719 --> 01:09:00,359
you hold on to just who you are and you act accordingly to who you are so you

399
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:08,040
need to live your life according to who you are if it's what is the condition of anger so so I

400
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:14,640
saw the anger at her and I offered her the opportunity to not be angry I didn't

401
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:21,960
try to talk her out of anger she would she was being attacked by these people no question that she should

402
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:27,420
react to it she didn't have to be talked out of it she just needed to get back in touch

403
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:32,758
with her own intentions and not be changed by them

404
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:40,140
not to give the power over to the opponent and guess what I'm trying to to get to

405
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:47,580
though is it's not just a one-off case it's a case where this person spend so much time in the in the state

406
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:52,920
of anger that do I think that I talked her out of being angry no I only gave

407
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:59,040
her a piece another way to that she could experience the moment right I hope

408
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:05,460
those moments increase for her right you cannot change someone else's name right and you can't if you are the recipient

409
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:12,000
of their anger which I also experience you can either say I hear your anger I

410
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,580
hear your objections but I have no quarrel with you or you can engage in

411
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:23,840
becoming angry in response which is not useful

412
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:31,520
you can just say I have no quarrel with you it's amazing what that will do

413
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:41,219
thank you but you have to reside in a place of here I am just as I am

414
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:46,620
it takes courage to be present it takes a lot of courage to live in the

415
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:51,860
present moment I don't think I had any clue as to how much

416
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:58,860
happiness lies in the present moment though thank you everyone

417
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:06,000
and thank you very much Kevin for taking care of me yeah well thank you everybody and uh we'll see you all tomorrow thank

418
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,820
