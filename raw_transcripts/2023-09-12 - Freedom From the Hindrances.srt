1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,140
good evening everyone welcome

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:16,020
uh my name is Jim Podolski Diana is away this week and so she asked

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,460
me if I would fill in for her so I'm sort of a substitute teacher

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,939
so he can expect the same that you might from a substitute teacher

5
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:34,020
most of the alternate teachers actually started a three-week retreat yesterday

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,559
so um

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,839
so I'm going to share with you some of my

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,260
thoughts on understanding about Buddhist practice

9
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,079
Diana didn't give me a particular subject to talk about

10
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,760
um a couple weeks ago I went to visit a friend of mine who this year was put in a Memory Care

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,280
Facility and he's still pretty high functioning

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,979
and he was quite displeased with how things were going

13
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:26,280
and so the head of the um this place uh called about 10 of his

14
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,119
friends together to talk to him about what his dissatisfaction was and how we

15
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,340
might help in a in a skillful way in a way that

16
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:47,000
um would both benefit him and also not lead to him being harmed

17
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:55,200
one of the things that he talked about a lot were issues of freedom and autonomy

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,040
and choice and

19
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:09,020
it really struck me you know like we hear about Freedom so much

20
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:18,480
particularly on a day like today 9 11. um and it took me back to the late 90s when

21
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,680
Gil franstall gave a talk on freedom he said that oftentimes the type of

22
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Freedom that we talk about in day to day um environments

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,360
is what he calls freedom 2. so it's freedom to do certain things

24
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:45,440
freedom to say certain things freedom to think certain things

25
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,300
and sometimes that's goes along with some

26
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,840
recognition of responsibility and consequences

27
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,180
and non-harming sometimes it doesn't you know sometimes

28
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:10,860
it's Freedom too is some expression of wanting to just follow one's impulses in

29
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:17,540
a in a way that may or may not be wise or beneficial

30
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,760
what Gil said and stuck with me all of these years was that the practices that the Buddha taught

31
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:34,140
were me really maybe better characterized as freedom from

32
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:41,659
so freedom from mind States and actions that might harm

33
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:45,319
oneself or others

34
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,060
and it then made me think a little bit about

35
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,459
how what brought the

36
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:06,180
Prince scotama the Buddha to be to

37
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,080
um go out and discover what he discovered

38
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,139
so you may have heard this story I'll give a a very short version of it

39
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:26,160
um but Prince Kodama was living in a palace

40
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,820
his father was a king and so he was in an environment where he had you know the

41
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,940
best food the best clothes the best entertainment um

42
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:47,639
you know as much pleasant as could be put together and as little unpleasant

43
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,820
and that that was kept from him as much as possible

44
00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:00,240
and that sort of worked until he got into his second later part of his 20s

45
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,199
and he got curious about what was going on outside the palace walls

46
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,960
so he made an arrangement with one of his attendants to sneak out of the palace

47
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,400
I suppose probably got some sort of Disguise and walk out you know in the village and

48
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,820
see what what was it like outside of the palace

49
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,979
one of the things that he came across one of the first things he came across was a person who was sick

50
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:40,259
now believe it or not as he was growing up they were able to keep from his view

51
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:46,380
anybody that was sick so he had no idea what sickness was like what disease was

52
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:53,400
like and it shocked him you know he didn't realize that that was part of

53
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:02,000
human life and they continued on and then

54
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,520
they came across somebody that was old I imagine somebody that was probably

55
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:15,380
sort of bent over maybe had a cane of some kind um

56
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:24,000
living in that realm myself right now I know most of many of my friends have trouble hearing or seeing uh and I'm

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,460
sure back then there was there weren't cataract surgeries or hearing aids so he saw somebody that was um

58
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:38,520
old I suppose probably wrinkly skin and he again was you know just was

59
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,479
astounded that this was uh that this occurred and his attendant

60
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:51,800
you know told him oh yeah that this is what happens to human beings

61
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,020
and then the Third thing that caught his attention was he

62
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,419
saw a dead person he saw I assume somebody that was maybe you

63
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:08,699
know a funeral procession or being prepared for uh

64
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:17,660
cremation and he wanted to know what what is this why why is that person not moving

65
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:22,919
and so his attendant told him well this is death and um

66
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:28,340
it's inevitable you know everyone is going to die

67
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,520
and then the fourth person that caught his attention was a monastic somebody in

68
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,819
robes walking I think it was across a field in a very

69
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:48,900
Serene and peaceful manner and so we went back to the to the palace

70
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,660
and this this really shocked him this really you know had an incredible effect

71
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:00,419
on him so much so that he decided he was

72
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:05,520
struck with this question of is there any way out of this is there

73
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:13,080
any way out of sickness old age and death he had to know he he didn't want to

74
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:20,280
believe that that was true and of course associated with sickness old age and

75
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,120
death were suffering and pain and grief

76
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:33,060
and so he made a decision to

77
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:38,099
to leave the palace to leave his wife his newborn son

78
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:44,039
his parents I mean his father I think his mother had passed away before then

79
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,980
and um you know leave the security and luxury

80
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:57,180
of the palace to to go and really seek answers to is there freedom from

81
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,760
sickness old age and death and

82
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:09,720
I suspect because he saw the the monastic that he decided to go in that

83
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,079
tradition you know put on robes and um

84
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:23,120
seek teachers he apparently mastered many forms of meditation

85
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:30,800
um he thought maybe the problem was the body itself and so he

86
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,660
ate like one grain of rice a day until his body was emaciated thinking

87
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,760
okay well maybe just um

88
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,019
maybe that's a way to get free of the of the um

89
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,540
suffering of having a body and at some point he decided no that's

90
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:00,839
you know he wasn't getting any closer to the freedom that he was looking for

91
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:07,200
and so he started eating again and then he had

92
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,200
based on his seven years of practice he was able to have deep insights that led

93
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,019
him to be one evening to become totally um

94
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:25,200
awake totally you free from

95
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,980
uh these concerns that he had you know kind of saw that there was

96
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,920
that the that there was some clinging that um

97
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,540
led to the suffering so

98
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:54,000
to me that was quite inspiring somebody well they would just drop everything you know I suppose in

99
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,940
in this day and age it would be like quitting a good job

100
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:06,959
you know giving all your money to charity um and just

101
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,600
you know wandering around looking for teachers looking for

102
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,500
Spiritual teachers

103
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,320
um on Saturday there was a monk here tan

104
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,839
Jeff who gave a talk about the four noble truths and one of the things he

105
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:38,640
said towards the end of the day was that one should cultivate desire for the

106
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:45,560
path cultivate desire for the goal and so

107
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:53,339
I wondered how how does one cultivate desire to be free

108
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:59,279
to the degree that the Buddha did and so I asked Han Jeff how did you cultivate

109
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,560
the desire that led you from going from being potentially a college

110
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,160
professor to a monk and he gave a very very brief answer he

111
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,260
didn't he didn't go into his life story but you know it was basically from

112
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,300
suffering you know it he had had a roommate in college who had

113
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:27,180
taken his own life and um had some

114
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:36,380
intense psychological experience that made him decide to become a monk

115
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:47,000
um so that's something that I ask myself about like how

116
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:56,459
do I develop a sense of desire for

117
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:03,180
walking the path I don't think that it's just through

118
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,519
willpower through the ego

119
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,420
it's helpful to have friends that are on the path Sangha places like

120
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:21,600
this um call the animita groups

121
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:29,120
the other thing that I've learned over the years at least from from Gill

122
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:37,560
was that you don't you don't have to imagine that

123
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,380
the fruits of this practice are something that's going to happen a long time from now

124
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:51,920
you know like it took the Buddha seven years of just you know practicing non-stop doing nothing else

125
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:59,579
um it might take that to to get the full realization that the Buddha had I don't

126
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:06,240
know I'm I'm not there but there's also some Freedom that you

127
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:13,800
can experience moment to moment you don't have to be fully enlightened

128
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,200
to have some benefit from this practice some

129
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,600
freedom and

130
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:30,540
that leads me to um you know sort of the question of well

131
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:36,240
what what is it that you want to be free of

132
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,760
are free from and so one of the lists of of things

133
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,399
that it's I'll say it's considered valuable to be

134
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:55,800
free of but I think it in practice I've found that it's it's valuable to be free of are what's known as the hindrances

135
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:02,399
and there's a book that I just happen to have here called unhindered by Gil franstal

136
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:10,639
that um explains in Greater detail what these are and how to work with them

137
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:18,600
um so I'm going to give a maybe sort of a synopsis of this

138
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:26,880
the hindrances are mental activities that tend to cover

139
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,639
over what's going on so

140
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,860
uh sometimes sometimes I think of the hindrances as

141
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:45,060
um my unskillful helpers you know they want to protect me from

142
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:52,019
seeing something that I don't want to see uh uh maybe that's useful in the short term

143
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:58,639
but in the long term uh that isn't helpful

144
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:04,260
so the first of the hindrances is sensual desire

145
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:09,959
you know desire to have certain sense experiences

146
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:17,339
now there's nothing wrong with having sense experiences the problem comes when

147
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:23,279
they take over when we when we lose

148
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,920
um awareness and become

149
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:35,240
uh I'll say in a certain way captivated by them

150
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,540
so I suppose a simple sensual desire is

151
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:48,300
I know that I have a box of chocolate covered ice cream bars at home

152
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:55,259
and when this talk is over I'll go home and I'll have one and it'll be enjoyable I'm sure

153
00:16:55,259 --> 00:17:01,920
um if I were to go home and eat the whole

154
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,240
box that may not be so skillful um

155
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,459
the analogy that that's often used for sensual desire is like a pond that has

156
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:20,100
die in it so you can imagine like a swimming pool at somebody poor

157
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:25,199
dye in that it would be hard to see accurately what's in there

158
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,720
that the colors wouldn't be correct and it might be kind of dark

159
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,380
so

160
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:43,980
I suspect you've all had some experience of being captivated by sensual desire at some

161
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,799
point you know whether it's for ice cream or food or

162
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:56,720
um thrill rides um

163
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:02,419
and so how do we get when we're caught by something like sense desire how how

164
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:07,500
can we get free of it how can we become free from it

165
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:14,280
and the suggestion again in this book

166
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:22,860
is to First be mindful of it so mindfulness

167
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:29,820
is a really important tool for freedom in that

168
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:36,660
although we we often cultivate mindfulness on something simple like the breath or the walking

169
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:45,360
it's helpful to be mindful of what's going on in our mind so paying attention to

170
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,900
is there sensual desire that's acting right now in my mind

171
00:18:51,900 --> 00:19:01,020
and um and then to bring some examination to it

172
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:08,840
what happened that this arose what what were the conditions that came together

173
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,059
um is there something underneath it are

174
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:22,679
there some some emotions or some thoughts did something just happen

175
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,380
that that we might not want to see

176
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:34,140
um and so examining it and that doesn't mean

177
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:39,419
just thinking about it over and over again but really feeling

178
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:44,900
what that's like in the body um

179
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:52,799
allowing it in a certain way not taking a not making it the enemy not making it

180
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,980
something that um we have to fight against

181
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,960
but really kind of getting to know it

182
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:12,020
and in that recognizing of it with mindfulness in that examining of it

183
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:17,820
we may find that over time it lessens it might just lessen on its own like at

184
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:22,520
some point you might just find that it's

185
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,700
you know you just like well what was that um

186
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,760
you may also want to do something about it so there there are some antidotes for

187
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,280
these mind States uh

188
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,000
one of them for a sense desire is often

189
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,160
seeing the downside of it like one of the practices that the

190
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,559
Buddha taught for when you become obsessed with

191
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:05,340
a body either yours or someone else's you can do this practice where you

192
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:11,400
imagine the body being taken apart and so like all of the different organs

193
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:18,539
and pieces are like laid out on the floor in front of you it's called the 32 parts of the body

194
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:27,900
and you can look at them and you think are any of these desirable you know you know and that's kind of an

195
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:33,780
extreme practice well it's certainly a practice that I've been

196
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:39,179
aware of for some time and it is practice on Retreat some

197
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:47,100
um but there's other practices that one can do to consciously lessen that sense

198
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:53,700
desire [Music] um somebody told me that when they

199
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:00,240
practiced in Thailand they were in a monastery and there was a skeleton hanging

200
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,740
in the back of the hall and there was a sign on it that said this is the skeleton of Miss Thailand

201
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,900
1932. so when you look at that skeleton you

202
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:18,260
know there isn't you know any kind of attraction to it that

203
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:24,419
I'm Gonna Miss Thailand in 1932 might have evoked

204
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:30,720
so um so there's being aware of the hindrance

205
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,880
examining it uh lessening it

206
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:43,799
um and then at some point um letting it go it may let go on its own or you may just

207
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:52,280
decide to substitute some other thoughts or practices

208
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:58,260
and then finally appreciating the absence of that hindrance

209
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:03,720
like noticing when that hindrance isn't operating it's like oh yeah you know

210
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,139
right now I'm pretty content pretty happy

211
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:20,400
and so by appreciating the absence of it it may make it easier the next time it

212
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,880
arises to see that it isn't something that you really want to um

213
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
Foster

214
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,059
so that was the first of the five hindrances is sensual desire

215
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:46,039
the next one is ill will and the

216
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:53,039
image for that I think the metaphor for it is uh like a a boiling water

217
00:23:53,039 --> 00:24:00,960
so when water is boiling you know if you try to look into it and all you see are the bubbles you can't really see

218
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,140
um clearly or accurately

219
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:12,360
and again with ill will recogn you know

220
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:19,140
first of all developing what I call a certain vigilance for when

221
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:26,179
ill will is operating in the mind this one

222
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:32,940
I think what I've noticed these days is that in

223
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:38,520
well ill will seems to sell newspapers right you know getting people angry

224
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,520
getting people upset um

225
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:49,020
so there's a so it takes a little bit more active

226
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:56,240
practice I think to just notice how often triggers for um

227
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,299
ill will or aversion arise and

228
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:10,980
you can then do the same processes for sensual desire you can first of all

229
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:17,100
recognize it see what it you know kind of feel it in the body

230
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:24,120
um notice what it's like

231
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:31,320
uh examine it you know what what were their triggers for it or their thoughts were

232
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:37,700
their emotions where their activities um

233
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:45,480
that triggered it um is there a way to lessen it

234
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:51,000
um one of the things for ill will like one

235
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,500
thing that can lessen ill will is doing an active practice Like Loving kindness practice

236
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:05,460
um I do that as sort of a

237
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,679
like taking my medicine before I get out of bed in the morning I always do a

238
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,620
period of loving kindness before getting out of bed just as an antidote for probably what's

239
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:22,700
What will what I will encounter that day

240
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:30,120
um letting go of it

241
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:36,360
you know that's I think if you really feel what anger is

242
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:45,559
like you may find well this is this actually isn't very pleasant this is not a place that I want to hang out in

243
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:55,200
and then appreciating its absence so noticing like throughout the day just

244
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:02,299
asking yourself well is there ill will operating do I

245
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,000
you know

246
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:13,440
there's many many forms of this you know all the way from just raging violence to

247
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,740
just mild annoyance so it isn't like it's just one uh

248
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,120
one size fits all

249
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:32,039
um the next hindrance is actually described as a pair of hindrance it's a sloth and

250
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:38,640
torpor now those are kind of old-timey words that we don't use in

251
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,940
or I don't use in my day-to-day interactions with people but they point

252
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:51,240
to sort of low energy one of them is low energy in the body and one is low energy

253
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,720
in the mind and this the this pair that's often

254
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:04,799
described as a single hindrance I think that's one of the ones that's that's the hardest for me

255
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:12,120
um it's hard to be mindful when you don't have much energy you know you just if you don't have much energy

256
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,400
you don't have much curiosity and much incentive

257
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:23,700
so it takes some getting some

258
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:31,220
desire to get curious about it and investigate

259
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:38,460
sloth and torper those are often described as like an

260
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:44,120
algae filled pond um

261
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:53,039
again so allowing it really recognizing that it's there then doing some

262
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,200
examination and then lessening it

263
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:06,799
so from for me one of the skillful ways of lessening sloth and torpers

264
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,419
to get up from sitting in front my computer and going for a walk

265
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:18,779
you know or just doing something you know getting some movement going

266
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:26,220
um another way which is probably just sort of so-so is um

267
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:31,380
iced tea and and dark chocolate those those those tend to bring a certain

268
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,720
energy to the body that uh

269
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:46,559
in the monastic tradition I forgot about that yeah in the monastic tradition they don't eat food after the midday meal

270
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:54,299
but chocolate is considered medicine so they can have that at any time so on Saturday

271
00:29:54,299 --> 00:30:00,299
at the end of the day I gave tan Jeff two bars of dark chocolate because I knew he I knew that that was something

272
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:07,520
he could accept after the midday meal and I happen to know that he likes it

273
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,220
um

274
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,539
and then Letting Go letting go of that you know sometimes I find by just

275
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:24,840
starting to do something the energy will return and um

276
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:31,039
and it's kind of like I get get out of that being stuck

277
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,080
and then appreciating the time when sloth and torper aren't I act aren't

278
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:42,779
operating you know just I tend to be a night person so this time

279
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:49,440
of the day I don't feel any sloth interpreter when I wake up in the morning it's a

280
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,720
different uh case but you know appreciating like oh

281
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,898
yeah you know it's actually enjoyable

282
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:08,340
to be um appropriately energized

283
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,779
another pair uh another hindrance that's often given as

284
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:21,299
a pair is restlessness and worry so just like sloth and torpor are low

285
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:28,860
energy in the body in the mind restlessness and worry are sort of

286
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:33,919
agitated energy in the body and in the mind

287
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:42,539
and again you can do the same thing recognize when those are present examine

288
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:47,899
uh what thoughts what emotions what

289
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:56,120
actions preceded that um what does it feel like

290
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:04,100
I suspect it's mostly unpleasant but you may actually find agitation Pleasant

291
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,580
uh lessening that uh

292
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:23,399
sometimes when I'm feeling restless it's because there's so many things that I'm trying to do simultaneously and so

293
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:30,779
sometimes just starting doing one thing will bring a little bit more focus and

294
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:35,419
reduce the the restlessness and agitation

295
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:45,000
and then appreciating when those restlessness and agitation aren't

296
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:53,039
operating and then the final hindrance is doubt

297
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,519
and that's sometimes described as a mud filled pond

298
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,220
and doubt is also one of I think it's considered one of the hardest

299
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:10,440
hindrances to work with because it's one of the descriptions of it is like

300
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:17,760
you just don't know what to do you know like you're unsure of what you should do next or is this practice going to really

301
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:24,120
work or should I be doing some other practice you know maybe I should be doing Sufi dancing instead of

302
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:31,140
this mindfulness so

303
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:38,220
examining doubt can be um challenging you know it's like you

304
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:45,480
look at it and you go well is this doubter isn't it what should I you know is there a way for me to lessen it

305
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:52,140
um this has been something that that has

306
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:59,240
been a part of my experience all my life um

307
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:05,760
when I was in graduate school I got married and I was married for about 10 years and one of the things that I liked

308
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:11,460
about my wife is she never had any doubt she was always absolutely sure of

309
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:16,858
herself I didn't always think that she was right

310
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:22,500
and uh there were times when it was annoying but whenever I was in a place of

311
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:31,440
uncertainty outside I could look to her for certain you know like well what should we do and she had very refined tastes and and

312
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,398
tell me what's tacky and what's not tacky um

313
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:44,839
but that that strategy really didn't work you know if you if you try to rely on another person

314
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:51,480
to get you out of uncertainty uh

315
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:58,099
it develops it doesn't work at least in my experience so

316
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,300
sometimes I think you just have to make a decision and just you know decide okay

317
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:09,980
I'm going to do this and then stick with it for a while and see what happens

318
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:21,859
and then when doubt isn't present appreciating it you know again that sense of like oh yeah I

319
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,420
I know exactly what I'm going to do after this talk I'm going to go home and have my

320
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,460
truck ice cream bar there's no doubt about that

321
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:39,780
so those are that's one of the lists of

322
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:46,200
things that one can I I believe you can develop some freedom

323
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:54,180
from here and now you know it doesn't take seven years of aesthetic practice or

324
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:59,820
something to reach some final and um

325
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:06,619
irreversible freedom that that there is there is freedom

326
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:15,060
available in this practice moment to moment that you can access by

327
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:20,640
by paying attention you know by bringing some curiosity some

328
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:26,720
investigation to um

329
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:36,480
checking it out feeling what's it what's it like you know what's it like both when that hindrance is operating and

330
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:43,079
when it's not and so in the short term there's freedom

331
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:48,420
and then in the longer term you may find that the hindrances don't

332
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:55,500
arise as much I don't know of anyone whose claims that

333
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,900
the hindrance has never arise for them anymore

334
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:06,599
but I think how you relate to them can change over

335
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,160
time as you do this practice

336
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,660
yeah so um

337
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:26,099
so freedom from I think is something that that's

338
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:34,440
um something that we can aspire to and practice day-to-day

339
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,760
so um and again I'll get one one more uh

340
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,760
plug for Gill's book on unhindered if you look at it you can see that it's

341
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:56,579
I obviously haven't read it multiple times but I have read enough of it to um

342
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:02,400
remind me of what I've learned from Dharma talks and other

343
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,400
sources over the years so

344
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:16,740
thank you all and we do have some time for questions if anyone wants to ask Sally will give

345
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,520
you the microphone

346
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,780
now Michael

347
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,359
thank you I get two things usually I'm pretty hard on myself when I'm meditating and then I heard a dog

348
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:46,020
barking a little while ago and if anyone else heard it but I was thinking oh that's funny and silly and I kind of enjoyed it oh the kindfulness and loving

349
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:52,440
kindness is working and then when you're talking about doubt I was thinking that it struck kind of a tone with me I think

350
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:59,160
maybe today's generation or just today's society we're sort of bombarded by choices kind of a paralysis by analysis

351
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:05,339
should I do this type of meditation or that type of medicine which one of the ten and sometimes it's just hard to pick

352
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:11,700
one or the other and whatnot but thanks for the talk oh you're welcome yeah there we really do have a lot of

353
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,160
choices and I um

354
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:22,500
for me part of it is consciously not making choices you know like somebody

355
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:28,700
says well you know A or B A or B and I go well I'll get back to you

356
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:35,300
you know at least some some choices you

357
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:44,339
I decide judiciously which choices to to me but

358
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:47,660
thank you for your comment

359
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:56,099
thank you for your talk tonight uh sorry I was late um and just like listening to the

360
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:02,160
hindrances on the one on um it's out also I just kept thinking it's kind of

361
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,440
another form of unwillingness in some ways first it could be

362
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,800
um I mean making a decision or not

363
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,839
um I think like I can think about like what I'm not willing to do and usually it's

364
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:24,839
because of there's something underlying and for me sometimes it's fear or

365
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:30,359
it might be um I know it better or I'm doubting someone

366
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:35,880
telling me something you know those are the things that they're so familiar that

367
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,520
I can catch myself and then just go for it because you can ask your question like you could ask yourself what's the

368
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:49,920
worst thing that would happen you know if I did make a decision you know it just um it I think sometimes I think

369
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,440
like making decisions eliminates all those other possibilities but you just

370
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,900
have to take a leap and yeah I think out of everything you've talked about I

371
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:07,020
started really thinking about doubt yeah and how it is for me but yeah

372
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:12,660
good yeah that's as I said it's it's considered one of the hardest

373
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:20,180
hindrances to work with I find that I often

374
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:29,940
well I shouldn't say often some of the time I feign confusion to

375
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:36,000
get out of doing something so so I don't know if that's even

376
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,880
fold out or something but yeah it's

377
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:50,460
yes thank you for the talk so one very

378
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:56,660
light-hearted question can you have like coffee instead of iced tea for low energy

379
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:03,180
yes you know it's interesting um when I first started going on meditation

380
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:09,480
Retreats they would purposely not offer coffee you know they would not make you

381
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:15,240
could bring your own and you could have those little pour overs and that but they wouldn't um

382
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:21,420
offer it I guess because it if you drink

383
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:27,859
more than a certain amount it kind of causes agitation in the mind

384
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,300
more recently I found it at the inside Retreat Center they make coffee every

385
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:40,800
morning there's enough people that wanted it so it's kind of it's uh

386
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,700
it's it's uh kind of changed I personally for me

387
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:54,200
T doesn't make me as jittery as coffee so that's kind of a personal

388
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:00,660
experience but uh yeah

389
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:07,920
is that something that you like doing drinking coffee yeah I think like

390
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,400
if I go on a retreat and don't have coffee then I just like sleep off during the meditation

391
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,680
I think like there is some sweet spot like you said in moderation then I'm

392
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,640
able to like be one pointed but if I drink like too much then anxiety

393
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:34,099
yeah so thank you so much thank you

394
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,520
any other questions

395
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:53,339
okay well we're just just about at nine o'clock so thank you all for um

396
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,460
yeah
