1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,100
so tuning in tuning into that Joy of being together

we invite you all to notice how it feels in your heart notice how it feels

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,480
to be present with this virtual Sangha some of you have been coming for years

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,240
and appreciating the greetings just taking that in

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,560
making that into your heart

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,340
and when you're ready after you've had a chance to greet your friends

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:49,200
Global community to sit back in a posture that is upright alert and

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:58,340
at ease whatever that is sitting standing lying down and begin to turn your attention inwards

9
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,440
will you be doing any last little thing that needs to be done

10
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,360
before settling into the next half hour

11
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,020
in the tuning tuning in to your life's breath

12
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,740
your body your heart

13
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:36,659
and inviting inviting me this body relaxed

14
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,180
soften be at ease

15
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:04,640
making a couple of deeper slower more intentional breaths

16
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:12,440
and tuning into the sense of belongingness connection

17
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,900
with all of these other practitioners

18
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,620
and as the breath returns to normal

19
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:35,900
allowing that sense of connection belongingness to be sustained

20
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,739
feeling into any Joy

21
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:52,939
happiness contentment at being here with this practice

22
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,959
together

23
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,220
It Feels Right allowing a smile to come to your lips

24
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,260
I've been really noticing the embodied experience of being here now

25
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:33,019
feet hands the support beneath your seat

26
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:45,379
rooted here allowing the energy

27
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,440
off the breath to carry through carry through your body

28
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,040
each Opera

29
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,480
perhaps blowing on the Embers of any contentment

30
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,700
connection Joy that's present

31
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,500
settling in

32
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,259
connecting with breathing sensation

33
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,620
connecting with your heart

34
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,139
into the staining

35
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,180
sustaining the attention on each in-breath each out breath

36
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,280
each sensation or sound

37
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,479
dedicating the attention to the details the texture

38
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,259
at this moment

39
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:10,259
if you find a thought mood memory pulls the heart and mind

40
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,320
away into then and there

41
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:23,340
seeing how kindly graciously it's possible to return and connect

42
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,759
again with this moment this breath

43
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,900
and perhaps also celebrating the return of awareness

44
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:15,139
noticing and welcoming each moment of awareness mindfulness

45
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,840
and staying with

46
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:36,180
being with whatever is recognized before returning

47
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:41,539
to the primary object of attention

48
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:52,380
resting resting in the moment to the breath presentations

49
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:41,000
if the attention went rededicating yourself

50
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,240
to the complete total attention

51
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:58,519
study of each breath each sensation each sound

52
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:06,959
reconnecting and feeling the pleasure

53
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,360
of staying close staying connected

54
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,260
sustaining

55
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,760
remember each breath sensation sound to Ripple through

56
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,620
Ripple through your whole being

57
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
thank you

58
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:23,220
we have to be or flowing being that a stream of sensation or

59
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,520
sound

60
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,640
allowing resting

61
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:36,019
and last remaining moments of this meditation

62
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:44,220
the invitation is to gather up soak in any little goodness

63
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:50,340
happiness grew into Joy or pleasure mindfulness or

64
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:59,840
connection let them resonate sink in to your heart

65
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:12,740
basking what's good and being with with compassion all the rest

66
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,320
and then turning your inner gaze outwards

67
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,740
to all of the others in your life seen and unseen

68
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,039
I think generating the intention the aspiration

69
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:51,240
that through this practice through this life

70
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,400
May others experience benefit

71
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:18,200
noticing the feeling of generosity care in offering this wish

72
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:35,480
may all beings be happy may all beings be seen

73
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:43,679
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

74
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,179
be free from suffering

75
00:29:53,830 --> 00:30:00,980
[Laughter]

76
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,880
thank you foreign

77
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,299
thank you for the sincerity of your practice

78
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:34,500
[Music]

79
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,460
foreign

80
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:57,299
so today is the second of a five day series that

81
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:04,559
talks about factors of mine that support meditation practice and daily life in a

82
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,520
particular way most important meditative stability and

83
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:16,080
unification in a wise way for the purpose of wisdom and Awakening and

84
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,679
freedom so yesterday I covered the crucial

85
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:29,220
fundamentals of mindfulness and practice intelligence and today we're going to start on five

86
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:36,080
factors of stability samadhi often called the five genic factors

87
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:44,220
today is the first two factors which in the context of meditation in the sutans and commentaries

88
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,679
are almost always spoken of together they are the mental factors of

89
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:56,480
connecting and sustaining that's the taka and the Chara

90
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:04,320
while we talking vichara are normally associated with formal meditation the ideas behind them can apply to daily

91
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,779
life so just to give a couple of examples

92
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:14,820
um the taka connecting also has the meaning of thought or thinking

93
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:20,519
directed attention and this directed attention can be directed towards and

94
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:26,880
applied to pretty much anything an analogy in daily life is making an

95
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,880
initial connection with another person first key step in forming any kind of

96
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:41,279
relationship right so making a connection is so vital to relating that it's taught as a skill

97
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,559
and counseling training and many other relational fields

98
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:52,159
so that's vitaka connecting vichara

99
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,980
sustaining is the process of maintaining being with that initial connection

100
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:04,860
to use a continuation of the daily life analogy we can connect with lots of

101
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:11,300
different people but if there isn't sustained attention connection over time

102
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:17,540
relationships won't flourish or develop or possibly even continue

103
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,638
Butera also means consideration which in daily life means keeping

104
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:30,540
someone or something in mind in American English it's often known as thoughtfulness

105
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:37,800
this quality is also a key ingredient to maintaining relationships good ones anyway right

106
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,859
the same is true in meditation

107
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:50,520
if we don't connect with and sustain attention on the object the object of

108
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:56,460
attention in meditation or connect and sustain attention on meditation itself

109
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,280
it won't develop and deepen okay

110
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:08,040
so now for the more precise kind of definitions of these factors these terms

111
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,560
the Pali word vitaka can be translated best is kind of a word cloud

112
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:19,859
in non-meditative contexts it can refer to reflection directed thought

113
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:27,480
thinking and even a little bit of kind of intentional thought very very um

114
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:33,960
kind of focused it has a quality of fixity to it

115
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:40,079
kind of like a tapping Bichara almost always appears with

116
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:47,400
vitaka about meditation it almost never appears on its own and its word cloud is smaller it's a quality

117
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,680
of sustaining that emerges from Big charity the verb

118
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:58,320
to go about an object to go about an object

119
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,400
and it's a continued examination a non-discursive examination of this

120
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,440
object of attention the breath the body whatever it is necta

121
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:16,440
and this consideration in this non-discursive way

122
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:22,560
deepens the relationship with object of of our practice of our

123
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,440
attention and with meditation itself

124
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:34,320
soon be taka and Bichara are foundational for

125
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,900
cultivating greater mindfulness and concentration

126
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:46,800
in a sense the sound of each word hints at their different functions

127
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:54,320
so if you listen sounds like kind of a quick pulse

128
00:36:54,380 --> 00:37:02,280
vichara the Chara kind of hints at lingering it's longer

129
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,619
softer so in some similes

130
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:12,839
be taka is like placing your hand on a friendly cat or dog

131
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:18,079
vichara is stroking its fur

132
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,720
connecting is like a single Center Point

133
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,960
of a circle drawn with a compass and Bichara

134
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,240
is everything within the circle so there's the center point of attention

135
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,460
and then everything related to the object of attention

136
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,200
consideration going about sustaining

137
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:53,700
mitaka that initial application can have a bit of a fixed quality to it

138
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:59,040
kind of like a hand holding a bowl or a bell right

139
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,520
Victoria has a more moving about quality like rubbing a cough

140
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,099
or polishing the Bell

141
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:17,760
then vitaka is also like hearing the Striking Annabelle

142
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:24,960
can be like a Clank Bichara

143
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:31,859
is not just the Striking of the taka but the sustained ring

144
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:34,819
afterwards

145
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:49,099
so at first both vitaka and vichara are kind of

146
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:55,099
skills in a sense we develop these factors of mind

147
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:01,619
as our meditative practice deepens particularly when it has momentum

148
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:07,800
these mental factors begin to naturally emerge

149
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:15,780
as conditioned responses then a rhythm of connecting without

150
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:28,969
trying begins to build kind of like repeated Bell strikes [Music]

151
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,579
and then after the period of sustaining Bichara

152
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:46,740
begins to stretch out longer with fewer moments of vitaka the Bell strike

153
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:53,160
needing to happen persisting

154
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,160
sustaining

155
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,900
so together as these factors gain momentum the mind and heart start to

156
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:10,440
gain some meditative stability and perhaps part of why we talk on

157
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:16,440
vichar are presented together merely always in meditation is because they're

158
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,740
so interlinked connecting vitaka without sustaining

159
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:27,900
can feel kind of clunky like doing meditation by a checklist or

160
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:34,560
something like that can also feel disjointed or dry beechara

161
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,800
sustaining can stay with an object of attention once there's been a lot of connection and

162
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:48,300
reconnection with it but before that it can wander off in a cloud of vague

163
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:55,099
associations or something like that without this connecting and reconnecting

164
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:04,380
so it's worth noting that both of these factors connecting and sustaining mitaka

165
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:10,820
and gichara they're morally neutral they're not inherently good

166
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:16,200
it means relating to them with mindfulness and practice intelligence is

167
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:22,440
absolutely key misdirected vitaka and Vitara can help

168
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,540
create a phenomenon known as Yogi mind those of you who have sat Retreat are

169
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,579
probably familiar with this term Yogi mind is a phenomenon where the Mind

170
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:39,660
becomes preoccupied with or separates on something minor usually or blows

171
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:45,900
something very small out of proportion this can happen when concentration

172
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:53,820
starts to build Ruby taka and vichara but they're somehow misdirected or it's an object of attention an idea a topic

173
00:41:53,820 --> 00:42:00,540
that's not so helpful and that little bit of concentration sometimes a lot of concentration can

174
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:06,599
magnify things in strange and funny and sometimes even unhelpful ways

175
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:12,660
a really kind of sweet example of this I've heard from other practitioners and

176
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:18,180
in my own life is after Retreat someone will come up

177
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:24,960
and start to enthuse about how they have designed in their mind a better meditation cushion

178
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,560
better meditation cushion and this is classic to do on a retreat any discomfort kind

179
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:38,060
of feeds these ideas so

180
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:46,800
at its worst the taka and vichar can lead to obsessive thoughts or spinning out

181
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:53,220
in ways that distort our understanding of ourselves and of other people

182
00:42:53,220 --> 00:43:00,480
that's a topic for another time to really unpack it but just to name that the practice intelligence the

183
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,420
mindfulness of directing and where we direct things is important

184
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:13,680
there's a story from nasuta's very very famous um and powerful ruler

185
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:22,260
comes to the Buddha and here's a sincere practitioner he's deeply dismayed and asking why beings people who wish to

186
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:28,079
live in harmony and wish to live in peace so often live in hatred hostility

187
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:34,500
and immunity and he asks this question a number of

188
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:41,160
times in the Buddha and answering Saka the name of the ruler names a number of contributing

189
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:48,540
conditions jealousy avarice and greed desire of rewarding of wealth

190
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:55,400
and under the desire repeated directed thinking

191
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:02,940
born of a tendency to obsess many of us might recognize that last

192
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:09,000
part sometimes our minds just won't let go of something trivial or even unhelpful

193
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,720
right so this underscores the importance of discernment that mindfulness and

194
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:22,740
practice intelligence can reveal and asking the question non-discursively

195
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:30,240
every now and then is this even what I should be focused on is this object of attention or this way

196
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,280
of focusing way of sustaining helpful

197
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:43,220
or unhelpful beneficial or unbeneficial skillful or unskillful

198
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:51,300
and the key question might there be a way to direct and sustain the attention

199
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:56,540
so as to nurture what's most beneficial

200
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:05,339
then with that discernment there's the possibility of connecting

201
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:11,940
and sustaining attention on objects of meditation people topics activities

202
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:18,960
experiences that are life-giving nourishing conducive to Freedom

203
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,180
and that's a huge thing in life and formal meditation both this begins to

204
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:29,460
open a pathway to Greater Joy happiness peace

205
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,119
Freedom Awakening

206
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:42,599
so it's our last sort of aside vitaka and vichara can be directly observed in

207
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:50,460
daily life in our minds and I'll discuss this and continue exploring some of these genic factors

208
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,619
at IMC Tomorrow there's a half day Wednesday half day Meditation Retreat

209
00:45:55,619 --> 00:46:02,460
it's in person only however recordings will be posted to audiodarma.org

210
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:09,720
so if you're interested in hearing more about this you can hear it there is also on-site a few practice

211
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,480
discussions slots available from people who come

212
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:23,520
so in meditation starts a wise deepening of meditative

213
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:29,099
stability and that in turn begins to manifest as

214
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:36,839
Joy or happiness contentment petite and sukha which are the third and

215
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:42,960
fourth genic factors and those will be our topic for tomorrow

216
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:49,220
so a joy to be with you Sangha thank you for your kind attention
