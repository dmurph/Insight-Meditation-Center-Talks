so hello everyone on this Monday and um beginning of

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,520
a new theme as we move through these five days of the work week the

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,720
meditation week together and

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,720
um so we can begin maybe to have a little longer sitting than

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,120
usual to to

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,960
assume kindly lovingly a meditation

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,440
posture that has the balance between being alert and

8
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:55,760
relaxed Alert in the body relaxed in the

9
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:05,078
mind alert in the mind and relaxed in the

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,680
body and if

11
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,920
you're comfortable closing your

12
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,118
eyes or lowering your gaze

13
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,920
gently feeling your

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,560
body as if your attention is a gentle

15
00:01:49,560 --> 00:02:01,560
breeze allow your attention to blow through your body and the arms the legs the back the Torso

16
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:11,440
checking in gently touching into how your body is right now

17
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,239
and let the breathe of

18
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:46,720
awareness find its way to the body's experience of

19
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:05,440
breathing to feel the rhythm the massage of breathing in breathing

20
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,920
out as the Torso expands and

21
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,200
contracts and then slightly with not too much effort take

22
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:41,120
somewhat deeper inhales Fuller inhales and longer

23
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:52,720
exhales relaxing as you exhale

24
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,960
he and letting your breathing return to

25
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:45,319
normal with the exhales softening in your

26
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,479
body and whatever is not soft whatever is

27
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,080
tense soften around it

28
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,400
almost as if there's a light touch

29
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,800
surrounding what is uncomfortable

30
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,199
as you exhale softening in the

31
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,000
mind a softening that helps the Mind

32
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
settle

33
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:00,160

34
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,160

and as you exhale follow the

61

exhale all the way to the end as a way

62
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:21,480
to settle yourself all the way down to a

Force allow the exhale to be little Fuller than

66
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:08,000
usual following the movements and Sensations in the

67
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,000
body as you

for for

70
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:41,000
the more you think the less you can feel the body

71
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,679
breathing the quieter the thinking

72
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,559
becomes the more attention is

73
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,919
available for the body sensing

74
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:03,440
the rhythm of breathing in and breathing

75
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
out

76
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600

e

83
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

84
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

85
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,278
for for

86
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,120
and then as we come to the end of this

87
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:26,919
sitting to check in again with yourself The Gentle Wind of

88
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:32,360
awareness let it blow softly through the body and heart

89
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:39,240
and mind to know

90
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:48,440
yourself and in the knowing the way you know there's a gentleness a

91
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,278
kindness a care and

92
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,200
acceptance for

93
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:39,559
and as you check in with yourself imagine or feel and

94
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:48,720
see if how you're feeling right now could be a beneficial reference

95
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:56,039
point for protecting you from ways of thinking ways of

96
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:05,480
speaking ways of acting which cause harm to yourself or to

97
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:17,799
others might there be a way that you're settled or calm

98
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:23,519
or more sensitive at the end of a

99
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:32,080
sitting as sensitivity that gives you

100
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,960
heightened care to not harm self or

101
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:54,240
other do not easily succumb to stressful activity

102
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:17,200
a sensitivity for which it might be

103
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:25,120
easier to be kind and compassionate toward self

104
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:32,840
and all beings may all beings be

105
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:42,200
happy may all beings be safe may all beings be

106
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:47,000
peaceful may all beings be

107
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:57,600
free and as each of you is part of the group of all beings

108
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:07,159
may it be that your happiness is a source of

109
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:11,919
care for everyone else

110
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:26,430
[Music]

111
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:34,440
thank you

112
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:35,519
so h hello and welcome to this Monday as we begin the week of a kind of

113
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:42,360
a new theme of teaching and

114
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:49,399
um there's a discourse of the Buddha discourse sutas and that is called the

115
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:58,760
UDA suta UD d a y i and um it has the Buddha list five

116
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:06,159
qualities that are to be established in

117
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:14,000
uh when one teaches the Dharma so hopefully these are established in me as I teach

118
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,600
now but these five are also interesting because they make an interesting uh

119
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:26,519
reference point for anytime we're speaking with others are these five

120
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:32,240
qualities established in ourselves when we're

121
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:38,240
speaking and uh some of them might be a little bit of a stretch for ordinary speeching speaking

122
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,480
but um I think they're valuable reference points and certainly valuable

123
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,799
reference points also for being your own teacher in the Dharma how we navigate

124
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:56,559
and find our own way through practice I uh these are included in when

125
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:04,440
I teach people to become Dharma teachers uh I want them to be familiar with these five qualities and some of

126
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:12,279
them I put greater importance on than others and um I'll read the discourse to

127
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:21,039
you and the core of it and it uh there's a context for it and that is that U the

128
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:26,600
Buddha's kind of one of his main disciples is kind of main attendant

129
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:36,039
Ananda is is in town for something and he sees that there's a monk named UD

130
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:42,960
UD who is um surrounded by a big number of lay

131
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,760
people and he's teaching them the Dharma and we're not sure who this Udan

132
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,960
is but uh there is someone else in someone of more or less that name uh

133
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:02,000
elsewhere in the sutas possible it's the same person who is one of the most

134
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,240
misbehaving monks in the suas who breaks the monastic rules who seems to be

135
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,040
filled with greed and wanting things from people and so he's not necessarily

136
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:21,118
um Exemplar of being a good monk so uh this maybe explains a little

137
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:28,720
bit why then the Buddha went back to the bu Nanda went back to the Buddha and said Udin is

138
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:36,720
um sitting in town surrounded by lay people teaching them and the Buddha uh neither approves

139
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:43,079
nor disapproves of what he hears um but when the Buddha neither approves or

140
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:49,280
disapproves sometimes that actually is a sign that he's not so happy um that if

141
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,480
he would clearly approve if uh someone's teaching if he he does at

142
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,720
times so the Buddha then offered five qualities that are to be established in

143
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:09,400
oneself if one is to teach the Dharma and um so this is how it goes the

144
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:16,480
Dharma should be taught to others thinking I will steep I will speak step

145
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:23,560
by step the Dharma should be taught to others thinking I will speak for

146
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:32,839
practical reasons the DH should be taught for to others I will speak grounded in

147
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:38,599
kindness the D Dharma should be taught to others thinking I will not speak for

148
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:45,240
material reward the Dharma should be taught to others thinking I will speak without

149
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:54,000
wounding myself or others so these are five and um so I

150
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,880
like when there's five qualities because we have these five days of the week week together and so I'll go through them but

151
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,960
I'd like to go through them in a different order in which they appear because I'd like to uh connect them just

152
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,800
lightly to the themes of the last two weeks that were the

153
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:20,720
core uh kind of foundational teachings uh that underly how I teach

154
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:27,119
the Dharma and um or you know what I teach when I teach the Dharma that's last few

155
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:33,920
weeks have been the what and uh as important what we teach is how we teach

156
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,079
the manner in which we teach and I've known people who taught in a manner that

157
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,800
uh seemed so much about themselves like almost like they were praising

158
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,880
themselves or building themselves up to the audience they didn't feel like they were teaching the Dharma they were you

159
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,720
know they were con that how they were teaching wasn't conveying what the Dharma was their words might have been

160
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:04,200
good teaching but the how was not a teaching for people and

161
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:10,280
um the um so um how we

162
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:18,440
teach and so I would like to uh start with the first one um is um I will speak

163
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:26,400
without wounding myself or others without harming myself for others and that lightly connects to the last two

164
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:34,119
weeks the first First Quality First Foundation to my core teachings is

165
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:43,359
um is um suffering and the end of suffering and to heighten sensitivity to

166
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:52,319
uh to all the things that cause suffering or stress or harm um tension within us and uh if we

167
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:58,640
use the word Dua suffering as suffering translated suffering too much some people people interpret it to be

168
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:04,839
suffering as the big cast catastrophic kind of challenges of our life but in

169
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:10,440
the Dharma the word Dua applies to the whole range from the lightest little

170
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:17,800
extra tension or stress that we add to our situation unnecessarily to uh the full-blown

171
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:25,240
challenges of you know existential challenges of being a human but uh clearly the F focal point

172
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:31,880
of the Dharma is um not being um not

173
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:37,920
exactly being offended or hurt or may made uncomfortable by reality but being

174
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,040
harmed by it being wounded by it and that distinction is a very interesting

175
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,960
distinction to uh look into because some people are confused by it and so their

176
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:55,200
response to uh others um um uh is

177
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,680
confused there's a distinction between being harmed and being offended being offended doesn't mean that we're harmed

178
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:08,520
in any way but maybe we just feel disrespected or feel um very

179
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:14,839
uncomfortable in a certain kind of way we might feel um hurt we might feel hurt

180
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:21,880
meaning we feel kind of you know an ache or feel somehow deflated or discouraged

181
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:28,000
or something but we have the resilience we have the capacity to just go with that and

182
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,720
and um and not not hold on to it not be caught in it but harm is uh when people

183
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,880
when we're harmed when we harm ourselves or we harm others we're causing lasting

184
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,640
damage a wound that lasts for a long time that is not easily uh just uh let

185
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:53,359
go of or moved you know fall Falls away easily and so to teach the Dharma

186
00:39:53,359 --> 00:40:00,839
without harming self or others and when I teach the teaching people to be teachers uh it's that first one that

187
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:07,240
becomes crucial don't teach the Dharma in such a way that you're harmed yourself and one of the reasons I

188
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:14,119
emphasize that to new teachers is that how we are is is a big part of what we

189
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:19,400
teach and so if you're harming yourself you're not you're teaching harming

190
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:25,240
yourself if you're teaching caring for yourself then you're teaching the

191
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:32,160
Dharma and um so for for example when uh I'm teaching with other teachers uh on

192
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:39,160
Retreat and they get sick I I tell them please uh rest take care of yourself

193
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,400
because that's how you're going to teach the Dharma if um if you have challenges

194
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:51,839
any kind at all that you need to take care of yourself you actually teach something very profound in doing that

195
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:57,560
and even though you're scheduled to give the Dharma talk um uh and you feel

196
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:04,480
responsibility to show up and you know everybody's expecting it um if you show up and you're you're overriding the

197
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,560
self-care that's needed you're not really conveying the kind of inner care

198
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:15,720
that we want everyone to be involved in the Dharma and um and that uh part of what

199
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:22,920
Dharma practice is for everyone is to uh understand that the um things are

200
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:28,599
constantly shifting and changing and and becoming not what we expect did not what

201
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:33,640
the schedule was and so then everyone practices with

202
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,880
that so um so to so in ordinary life as

203
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:46,079
well uh to speak without wounding uh oneself or others to to be

204
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:53,319
in conversations without harming the the uh the relationship um and one of this

205
00:41:53,319 --> 00:42:00,240
heightened sensitivi that can come with something like mindfulness something like like a regular meditation practice

206
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:08,599
is we can feel and sense uh when um what we say shifts the Dynamics between self

207
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:14,359
and others we can see that people Flinch or see that people shut

208
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:20,800
down um I've been in conversations where people said something to me that um it

209
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,599
just felt like they closed the door to the conversation and uh and just said well you know then there's no way

210
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:32,040
forward now you know they said something definitively declaratively and we're no longer in a

211
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,359
conversation or a discussion it just you know and I in in my mind I think of that

212
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:43,280
the door's been closed and okay so now uh uh there's a something in the

213
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:50,520
relationship temporarily or in this conversation now shut down we're not in relationship anymore so that's a kind of

214
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:57,520
uh interpersonal harm that's caused or loss of connectivity

215
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,760
anger creates a real div div divide between people

216
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:10,160
hostility uh sarcasm sometimes cynicism sometimes and so to um spend a lot of

217
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:18,440
time complaining what is the effect that's on other people people who complain a lot are generally very

218
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,640
self-focused and um and not as tuned into how it is for other people as we

219
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:31,000
could be and so maybe we're not harming other people people but we are harming the relationship between two

220
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:38,440
people sometimes what we say is offensive and and we don't even know we're being offend offending someone but

221
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:44,319
if we're attentive we can watch and feel and see their posture shifted their eyes

222
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:49,839
have moved away that uh the smile they had dropped away or some kind of

223
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:57,400
energetic quality of their of their body slumps or settles or something and and

224
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:06,440
um so what's the effect that we have on others so with this orientation that I

225
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,480
did the last two weeks of focus on suffering and the end of suffering that

226
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:18,119
can translate um uh intimately to how we are in relationship with other people

227
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:25,440
the Dharma is not only something private and personal the Dharma uh sensitivity

228
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,200
that awakens within us the mind and awakens within us puts us in a a into a

229
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:41,079
mindfulness field with others as well and so it becomes natural uh to um to be

230
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:47,280
sensitive and maybe caring for others and oneself so we're not harming either

231
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,240
self or others some people uh it's the other itself that

232
00:44:53,240 --> 00:45:00,640
they don't pay enough attention to there's plenty of people who harm themselves in relationships they uh they

233
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,800
sacrifice themselves or they put themselves down or they limit themselves or they excuse themselves or they

234
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,200
apologize too much always ways which in subtle maybe very subtle is a kind of

235
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:17,520
self harm and um and so when we speak when

236
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:24,480
we're in relationships can we avoid harming ourselves and then and can we avoid harming others and I think this is

237
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:32,000
a phenomenal God for living a wise life and for the theme

238
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,480
of the suta it's a phenomenally important orientation for teaching the

239
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:45,280
Dharma and um and maybe some of you most of you I suppose are not Dharma teachers

240
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,800
but you might have occasion to want to tell someone something about the Buddhist teachings the Dharma teachings

241
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:57,920
that you're learning and they're important for you and so then be careful

242
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,280
that how you say it but how you tell other people that you don't harm them or

243
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,640
harm yourself in doing it and um and I've certainly harmed others and or at

244
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:17,280
least harmed the relationship between self and others when I was uh too caught up in the teachings and uh too enamored

245
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:24,880
in it and maybe a little bit maybe even too dogmatic about it that I was so excited about teaching it to telling it

246
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:33,040
speaking it I lost touch with the person I was speaking with so uh thank you very much and I

247
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:39,960
hope that uh um as we go through these Udo qualities that you find ways that

248
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:46,280
are are meaningful for yourself so thank you
