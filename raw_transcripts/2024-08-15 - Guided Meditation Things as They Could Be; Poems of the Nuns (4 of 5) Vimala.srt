1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,639
hello everyone and

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:13,960
welcome and one of

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:24,439
the emphasis for in Buddhism and the kind of Buddhism we practice and for Insight

4
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:31,640
Meditation is being with or seeing things as as they are being with things

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,680
as they are and that means you know being with things in the present moment

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,960
as they are and uh what's directly visible

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,520
immediate but there's a subcategory of things as they are which is often

8
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,440
overlooked in this practice and which um partly because if

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:04,198
we focus on it too much it causes a lot of problems but from time to time it's invaluable to

10
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:11,320
be present for this as well and this is things as they could

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:18,720
be in the present moment there's potential and to be aware of that

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,000
potential is uh encouraging it can be inspiring if the potential we're

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,040
focusing on is wholesome is good and the particular things that that could

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:39,040
be that this tradition emphasizes is that you could be

15
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,079
free there could be an experience of

16
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:51,840
thoroughgoing freedom freedom of the heart freedom of the mind and what freedom freedom from all

17
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,799
the ways in which the heart the mind is contracted

18
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:04,439
constricted all the ways in which it's limited by clinging and grasping and

19
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,440
desire greed hatred

20
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,400
delusion anxiety Prof things could be the mind

21
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:25,120
could be different the heart could be different and from time to time it's good to take that in that this is here

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,280
as well this potential and it's a potential that's not just a concept but it's potential

23
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:40,000
that sometimes especially when we're practicing meditation you could almost feel that it's close by you can almost

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,599
feel or sense or smell that this is a potential and then the idea is to be

25
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:56,360
wise about that to not spend then all our time thinking about what could be

26
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:04,920
but rather to use that as an inspiration to know oh I it could be so let's

27
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:15,640
practice how with what how things are with that in mind and in particular if uh it's useful

28
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:23,920
to think that how things could be is also a teaching a teacher for us for how

29
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,040
things can be now when we practice and in particular

30
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:40,680
uh in that freedom freedom from clinging freedom from aversion freedom from uh uh wanting and not wanting in

31
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:48,159
some contracted way is uh how things could be can we

32
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,400
find how to be how to be present how to be mindful here with what

33
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,400
is with some of that quality with some flavor sense that yes

34
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:08,079
to be mindful in a simple simple way that is free of being the

35
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:15,199
contraction or the pressure to want or not want free of

36
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:21,359
clinging so it means that attention the way we practice has a quality of freedom

37
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,120
of ease maybe some people call it equinity at times or peace or

38
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:35,479
calm and so the idea is to find how how to be aware so it so it has some of

39
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:42,880
the qualities of what could be and make it actually what

40
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:50,960
is and from time to time in Buddhism in Buddhist practice it's

41
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:58,000
useful to also keep in mind or realize what could be is a

42
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,440
radical freedom a thoroughgoing radical free from all

43
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,960
things that keep us contracted and the

44
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:16,720
representative um powerful representative modeling or example of this is people who choose to become

45
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,160
monastics where they choose to step away from a lot of the ways that it's easy to

46
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:31,000
be caught up in uh in life and work and family and relationships

47
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,720
and not that we have to do that ourselves but it's a that freedom does

48
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,800
involve a radical letting go even in the midst of work in midst of

49
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,080
family midst of a relationships not to dismiss them not to

50
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,479
avoid them or be aloof from them but so that we are not suffering in the middle

51
00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:01,638
of them and so when we sit down to meditate

52
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:14,440
sometimes to see it as a li a particular very special

53
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,039
time to let go fully it's a vacation from all clinging

54
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:30,840
all shoulds all requirements all for and against it can be a phenomenal

55
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,840
relief things as they could be a total letting go in Freedom here

56
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,880
and now so as we do this sitting

57
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:48,120
today and your your mind wonders off in thought remind

58
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,720
yourself that it could be different it could

59
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:02,160
be a full entering into a world of freedom from all attachments all

60
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,080
clinging In This Very

61
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,599
meditation and perhaps how they could be like that you can get a sense of it you

62
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:18,560
can feel it in a way that supports you to just really stay here for a few

63
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,879
moments really be present really let go into this

64
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:31,000
moment and your mind wonders away again then remind yourself things could be different things could be be free and

65
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,520
come back to that come back to that take the

66
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,479
risk take the challenge of these next 20

67
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,759
minutes to see if you can

68
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,960
taste freedom in every moment of being aware

69
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:02,199
of being alive so again as we have this week go sit

70
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440

and as we come to the end of this sitting

107
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:08,600
there is things as they are right now being present for our

108
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,760
experience present for the rhythm of the body

109
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:31,840
breathing we're being present for how we are doesn't need to exclude

110
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,760
anything but is free allows everything

111
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:48,799
without wanting and not wanting pushing away or holding

112
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:58,279
on giving room to how we are and in that room in that space that

113
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:06,000
we feel the freedom we sense the the lack of attachment just beyond

114
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,679
the edges of how we are

115
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,360
attached it teaches us something about how we could

116
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:24,399
be we could be living close to that freedom all the

117
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:32,279
time the freedom that's founded in the space of

118
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:36,360
awareness that holds all

119
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:45,320
things and then when we meet other people together with others we know

120
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:54,200
about others things as they could be is

121
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:01,840
important without some sense of that maybe the there's no

122
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,440
compassion compassion is having knowing that it could be

123
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:15,399
different this person doesn't could be not could not suffer as much as they

124
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,200
are things as they could be then motivate us to live compassionately

125
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,880
caring for others

126
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:39,440
things as they are and things as they could be a

127
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,360
wonderful mutuality both are there that can guide us in Freedom and

128
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:53,518
compassion and love in caring for this

129
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,158
world may they work together

130
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:05,720
May our freedom show us how to

131
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,679
care and may our care show us

132
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,519
freedom May how we live in this world be for the welfare and happiness of

133
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:23,840
everyone ourselves and others others and ourselves may all

134
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,360
beings self-included be happy

135
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,200
may all beings self-included be

136
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,440
safe may all beings self

137
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:48,200
included be peaceful may all beings self-included

138
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:56,799
be free free in such a way

139
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:04,720
that it's equal it's the same whether we care for others or for

140
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:14,240
ourselves doesn't have to be any different it's all care it's all freedom

141
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:27,149
[Music]

142
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,320
thank

143
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,880
you e

144
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,639
so welcome to this fourth talk where I reading some of the

145
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:42,840
verses the poems of the terries the the

146
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:50,600
ancient um nuns who were Disciples of the Buddha or

147
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:57,880
lived in the years after him after him and uh maybe the earliest poetry of

148
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:05,960
of religious poetry of women that survives and uh before I read some poems

149
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,320
today um I wrote a tentative introduction to my translation and I

150
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:18,919
want to read just a couple of paragraphs from it it's kind of setting the stage perhaps for what will the

151
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,000
poems the terata that is the verses of the Elder

152
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,519
nuns evokes the struggles in spiritual transformation of ancient Indian

153
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,960
women the stories of their challenges highlight their

154
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,399
success in attaining the ultimate goal of the Buddhist

155
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:49,600
path accounts of tragic and oppressive lives provide dramatic contrast through

156
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,799
their inspired words celebrating their great Liberation the social constraints and

157
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:01,039
oppressions experienced by women and ancient India are the backdrops for the

158
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:08,638
radical inner freedom and peace they achieve depictions of wisdom courage and

159
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:14,560
determination used to overcome their suffering culminate with confident

160
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:21,200
Declarations of their full realization and one of the ways that

161
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:28,358
they decare there's many ways they declare their full Liberation one of them is um

162
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:36,638
shattering the mass of Darkness to shatter this darkness is to

163
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:43,760
become free of the of the obscuring influence of ignorance and

164
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,720
delusion as a metaphor the mass of Darkness evokes not only a lack of self-

165
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:56,440
understanding insight and wisdom it may well refer to ignorance and blindness of

166
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,960
social beliefs that kept women oppressed this includes claims that

167
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:09,040
women can't attain Awakening because of their meager two-finger

168
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:15,599
wisdom that's reported in one of the poems to shatter the mass of Darkness

169
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,839
includes Breaking Free of oppressive social beliefs a freedom perhaps

170
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:27,320
represented most visibly in becoming a Buddhist nun one of the very few options

171
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:33,440
to live a life independent of the social expectations obligations and the many

172
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:42,280
limitations placed on the ancient Indian women for some it was the only way out

173
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,920
of the servitude of marriage of that

174
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,920
time so that's the so now I like to read some of these

175
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,079
poems and I'd like to begin with

176
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:07,079
um a poem uh One More poem that refers to pachara yesterday the last two days

177
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:14,680
I've referred to poems that either uh featured pachara or uh her her uh

178
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,839
monastic students referred back to her as their teacher and there's one I like

179
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:25,160
this one but it's uh also has a kind of dramatic

180
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:31,760
backdrop it's uh Chand which uh her name name means

181
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,800
Moon I was poor widowed without

182
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:44,720
children without friends or relatives so to have no husband no

183
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:52,720
children no relatives uh it's basically they have no no network of support

184
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,560
network of livelihood maybe without friends or relatives I

185
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:06,280
obtained neither food nor clothes taking a bowl and staff I went

186
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:14,319
from family to family begging for alms tormented by cold and heat I

187
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:20,760
wondered for seven years so extremely poor homeless

188
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,280
person and it wasn't like there were social services back then there weren't uh shelters for the homeless there were

189
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:33,079
not um uh institutions that care for

190
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:40,359
them so she wandered for seven years but then I saw a

191
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:47,079
nun receiving food and drink then I saw none receiving food and

192
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:53,359
drink approaching her I said let me go forth into

193
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,680
homelessness with kindness for me she

194
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:05,200
pachara allowed me to go forth then she advised me urging me

195
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:12,160
toward the ultimate goal hearing her words I did what she

196
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:22,200
advised the lady's words were not in vain I am now free free of

197
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:28,040
attachments so poor

198
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:36,359
poor homeless no family no friends abandoned by Society perhaps but

199
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:41,960
then received into the Society of monastics one of the only institutions

200
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:49,480
that were maybe someone like that could go and in that Society she received

201
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:55,680
teachings and practices and became free here's a little different

202
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:04,920
background for one of the nuns this is um fima which meant Pure or unstained and

203
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:11,920
sometimes the names and then hurt their lives something about the poems either creates a contrast or kind of highlights

204
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:18,359
something important about the nun so if you remember her name is to be Pure or

205
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:26,240
unstained she writes intoxicated with my skin color figure

206
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:33,720
Beauty and Fame relying on my youth I despised

207
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,839
others I adorned this body painted it up

208
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:44,040
babbled foolishly and stood at the brothel

209
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:52,640
door like a hunter with a snare laid out I displayed my ornaments revealed

210
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,240
ample hidden Parts performed much Magic and laughed

211
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:07,240
at many people but today having gone for having gone for

212
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:15,440
alms head shaven wrapped in the outer robe seated at the base of a

213
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:22,800
tree I became free of thoughts free of thinking so she's a nun now and

214
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,400
practicing and meditating and then

215
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:35,280
all attachments are severed both Divine and human all

216
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,960
clinging cast off I've become calm

217
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,920
released quenched so a dramatic difference of how

218
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:55,319
she lived her life earlier and then some reason she go went forth as a nun and attained something

219
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:01,599
radically different something that may was not possible in her earlier

220
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:13,280
life the next one is uh Sia and uh her name means lioness I love

221
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,000
this at her name lioness a name powerful

222
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:26,000
name from unwise attention I was afflicted by Passion for

223
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,680
sensual pleasure I was agitated about the past had no

224
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,200
control of my mind pervaded with defilements chasing

225
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:43,520
ideas of what's beautiful controlled by a passionate mind I didn't obtain a

226
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:50,359
peaceful mind thin Ashen and pale I wondered for

227
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:57,600
seven years I suffered not for a single day or night did I know

228
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:05,359
[Music] peace because of this I took a

229
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:12,680
rope and entered the woods saying it is better to hang

230
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:21,160
myself than to continue this wretched life I made a strong noose tied it to a

231
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:28,079
branch of a tree as I put it around my neck then

232
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:34,960
my mind was liberated so it's possible she was

233
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,559
already a nun and she wandered around as a nun practicing and she could never find

234
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:47,000
peace something about her mind was so caught and so finally in this despair of

235
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:54,599
her in her despair she decided to commit suicide and something about that act got

236
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:00,880
her maybe her attention in way nothing else had done somehow broke the spell of

237
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:09,319
her thinking her attachment her preoccupation that she Labyrinth of these difficult thoughts it broke it and

238
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:15,720
she discovered Freedom so I find it remarkable these

239
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:21,640
stories of the challenges these women had in their lives and how they

240
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:28,040
discovered an alternative the last poem

241
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,800
her name is MAA k um friend kie some of you might know

242
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:42,480
that K is a powerful word in in India I went forth meaning went off to

243
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,040
be a nun I went forth in faith from home to

244
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:56,400
homelessness I wondered here and there eager for gain and honor so she became a

245
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,160
nun but you was pursuing the wrong thing uh trying to acquire things gain and

246
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:10,359
become famous and honor neglecting the ultimate goal I pursued a

247
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:19,920
lowly goal I was controlled by defilements I did not know the renuncian

248
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:29,040
goal then sitting in my Hut this sense of urgency arose

249
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,480
I have entered the wrong path under the control of

250
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:42,359
craving short is my life I am crushed by old age and illness soon this body will

251
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:48,200
break apart I have no time to

252
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,800
neglect looking at the arising and passing of my experience as it actually

253
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:03,319
is I then stood up with my mind

254
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:11,040
free having accomplished the Buddha's teachings so

255
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:18,000
she was a nun but her mind was still caught up in Fame and gain and all kinds

256
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,359
of other things that just didn't uh weren't appropriate and then as an old

257
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:28,440
old person old a nun she finally kind of woke up this is not right I can't keep

258
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,720
doing this and she maybe gave herself over to her meditation and much more

259
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:39,800
diligently and wholeheartedly and a sense of urgency it's now or

260
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:47,200
never and she got concentrated enough to really see the inconstant changing

261
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:53,440
rising and passing nature of all experience dipped into the deeper under all the concepts the ideas the

262
00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:00,079
reifications we have and in the flow of lived life in the present moment her

263
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:06,680
mind let go and then as so many of the nun say

264
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:13,119
they had accomplished the Buddha's teachings so these uh ancient teachings

265
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:19,119
of the nuns they're over and over again telling us with their confidence and

266
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:25,240
their generosity their maybe compassion for the generations of people later who

267
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:31,640
are going to encounter these poems they're letting us know it is possible

268
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:38,240
it is possible to accomplish what the Buddha teaches it is possible to be

269
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:43,920
free so um May the women of ancient India from

270
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,240
2500 years ago May these words still live in

271
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,480
us thank you
