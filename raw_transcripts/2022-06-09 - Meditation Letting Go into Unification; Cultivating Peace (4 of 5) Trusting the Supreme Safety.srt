00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:09,360
greetings dear ones i so appreciate this online sangha

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,639
although unfortunately i can't see the chat during the sessions but i

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,760
do enjoy uh looking at it after the talk is over

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,279
and seeing many familiar names from far and wide

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,359
so today is our fourth in the series this week on cultivating

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,520
peace and the expression of peace we'll explore today

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,360
is letting go into unification

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,760
so as we've been doing this week we'll begin our meditation by making the

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,840
conscious choice to leave all of our concerns

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:06,320
agendas worries and responsibilities well outside of our meditation area

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,920
for the next half hour so the invitation is to take a moment to

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,240
carefully put all your concerns in a safe place on the other side of the door

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,680
with the commitment to leave them there you can always come back to them afterwards

14
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,000
now closing the eyes

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,880
getting settled we will practice

16
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,799
breathing in open non-reactive

17
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,840
peaceful awareness breathing out letting go

18
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:08,399
and as uh we did yesterday we'll begin our meditation by bringing awareness

19
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:16,160
our friend sati to the fore we know that what awareness is strong

20
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,080
it opens the door for us to seeing when unskillful states arise

21
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,200
and we can make the choice to not pick them up

22
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,319
with saute mindfulness in the forefront

23
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,959
we can bring a strong clear awareness to our posture

24
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,840
balancing and aligning the whole body

25
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,840
feel your physical and energetic connection to the earth

26
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,159
with roots going down deep from your sit bones

27
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,400
if you like you can invite the grounding energy of the earth

28
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:26,560
to flow up into your body through your seat gently moving up the spine

29
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,720
providing physical and energetic alignment to the posture

30
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,640
and then letting this energy exit through the fontanelle the small

31
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,239
energetic opening in the front of the crown of the head

32
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,480
in the vedic tradition this soft spot is called the infinite

33
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,080
chakra in sanskrit so maybe

34
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:15,400
you can imagine your energetic connection to infinite space

35
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,359
in qigong this soft spot is where we can absorb the energy of heaven

36
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,520
and draw it down into the body to be clear

37
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,639
drawing on this particular way of connecting to our our energetic body to

38
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,759
heaven and earth is not the teaching of the buddha

39
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,720
excuse me

40
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,479
but it works well for me although it may or may not be helpful for you

41
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:05,360
if it doesn't work for you no worries just come back to your normal posture

42
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,800
the buddha did however in his teachings on emptiness teach dwelling in the realm

43
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,000
of infinite space

44
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,759
so the idea is to have a posture that is both

45
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:31,600
grounded and spacious as a way of encouraging the mind to also

46
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,280
be simultaneously stable and open

47
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:51,840
breathing in normally and out normally do a quick scan from the head down to

48
00:05:51,840 --> 00:06:00,479
the feet relaxing letting go or just softening a little bit

49
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:08,639
any tension or holding and as you

50
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,479
do this relaxing scan breathing in

51
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,759
contented awareness breathing out

52
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:27,680
letting go we are cultivating a healthy balance

53
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,440
between being alert and being relaxed

54
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,759
breathing in contented awareness breathing out

55
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,160
letting go

56
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,639
settling in with the eyes closed

57
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,639
breathing in contented awareness breathing out

58
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,960
letting go

59
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:39,200
if the thinking mind becomes active we whisper

60
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:46,160
in a kind and loving way come back be here

61
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,240
breathing in contented awareness breathing out

62
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,560
letting go

63
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,399
breathing in contented awareness

64
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,120
breathing out letting go

65
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,880
now we're going to transition

66
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:56,400
from having

67
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,520
generated the condition of peaceful contentment

68
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,360
to the unification

69
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,200
the buddha teaches that in one who feels peaceful contentment

70
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,440
the mind becomes unified and the mind state

71
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,799
of unification the buddha is pointing to is like

72
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,919
coming home coming home to a place where we feel

73
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:38,760
safe and where we can really be ourselves

74
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:46,160
so over these few days we've put in place the conditions for the arising of

75
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:53,840
samadhi the subtle joy of resting in awareness

76
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,960
tranquility and peaceful contentment

77
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:11,280
and is what is so nice about samadhi is that we don't have to be perfect

78
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,760
to let go into this unification what a relief

79
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:27,840
in the unified mind there's room for all of us warts and all

80
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:36,799
nothing has to be different than the way it is including ourselves

81
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,320
so continue practicing now breathing in

82
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,440
quiet contentment breathing out

83
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,120
home to safety

84
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,840
breathing in quiet contentment

85
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,840
breathing out home to safety

86
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:13,039
you are home in your sacred seat of awakening your bodhimanda

87
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,159
knowing that everything is okay and all of you

88
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,840
is safe at home

89
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,799
breathing in quiet contentment breathing out

90
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,440
home to safety

91
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:04,399
as we come to the end of this sitting let's bring to mind the people we will

92
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:12,240
come into contact with today strangers as well as people we know

93
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:19,360
and making the wish the aspiration of offering them

94
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:27,039
our example our example is the very best way

95
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,480
to give these teachings to others

96
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,799
so through our example

97
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,039
we model and offer the ease

98
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:52,480
the happiness and the safety of being at home

99
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:59,639
with a mind at peace with things as they are

100
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,640
we have room to be just who we are

101
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:12,240
and we offer others the same freedom to be just who they are

102
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,919
and this is a beautiful gift

103
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:25,880
may all beings ourself included first of all be safe

104
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,159
may all beings know peace

105
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,840
may all beings be happily contented

106
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,320
may all beings feel at home

107
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:59,200
in their true abode of a unified mind

108
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:07,720
and may all beings everywhere be free

109
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,659

113
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:57,360
welcome dear sangha it's lovely to be here with you all

114
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:05,519
some of us have been part of this online community since it started over two years ago

115
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:13,440
and i treasure this international sangha so i thank you for your presence

116
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,840
today is the fourth day in our theme this week of cultivating peace

117
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,200
and yesterday i appreciated the kind and thoughtful comments about my loss

118
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,760
when my little sister died she became ill 12 years ago and died

119
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,120
seven years ago and to be honest

120
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:44,159
i no longer experience her departure as a loss she's still very much present in my

121
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,240
heart yes i had been grieving intensely and

122
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,679
constantly for about five months before being able to in a retreat

123
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,720
setting dive into and then swim

124
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,720
in that ocean of tears and that was transformative

125
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,559
to abide in the lucid awareness of my pain

126
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:19,279
and finally to let go of wanting or needing a different reality

127
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,279
and this was profoundly healing

128
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:32,080
as i said when distress and loss give way to peaceful acceptance

129
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,919
then we are in a much better position to radiate our peaceful contented

130
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,039
abiding so that we can better offer support

131
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,960
to others who are suffering

132
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:54,480
and this ability to remain peacefully contented with whatever the dharma has on offer

133
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,799
for us is the condition that makes possible

134
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:07,760
the last of the necessary conditions for abiding in samadhi

135
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,799
the state from which the liberating insights of awakening

136
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:20,080
can arise so the expression of peace that we're

137
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,559
exploring today is letting go into unification

138
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,480
samadhi is usually translated into english as concentration but personally

139
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:39,120
i have a strong preference for translating it as unification

140
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:46,159
because in pali the word samadhi literally means gathering together

141
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,679
we are happily composed not needing anything to be different in

142
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,080
our present moment experience

143
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,559
for me the english word concentration has connotations of

144
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:08,800
maybe coming from the control tower which may suggest effort

145
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,158
and it's interesting that in the vast pali canon with so many teachings

146
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,878
there are no instructions that the buddha gave on what to do

147
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:26,000
to enter into samadhi rather

148
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,638
he taught that what we must do to advance on the dharmic path to awakening

149
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,800
is to put in place the conditions that allow for samadhi to arrive

150
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:46,000
spontaneously effortlessly those conditions of course begin with

151
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,040
living ethically and with generosity

152
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:59,760
and then in order to step out of the bonds of samsara the first thing we have to do

153
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,280
is to establish receptive awareness sati

154
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:13,440
this is the foundation of our practice both inside and outside of meditation

155
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:21,920
yesterday we spoke about living in awareness with satyapathana

156
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,839
evoking a metaphor for the mind of living in a messy house but one that

157
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,000
has a quiet living room now when we begin the dharmic path

158
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,359
clearly seeing dukkha both in our own

159
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:45,200
unskillful mind states and in the world around us

160
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:53,760
we see the mess and we know there's work to do to clean out all the other rooms of the house

161
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,520
and this work starts with our commitment to practicing continuous mindfulness the

162
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:07,200
best we can and as our mindfulness practice develops

163
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,880
we begin to get a feeling sometimes for resting

164
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,960
in present moment awareness

165
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:28,240
what i'd like to offer today is an instruction of

166
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,599
how to encourage these beautiful mental states

167
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,440
like sustained mindfulness so when

168
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,800
awareness arises and is

169
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:51,599
strong the instruction is to notice

170
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,839
appreciate and relax

171
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,720
into the experience of strong mindfulness

172
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:13,839
and we do this with all of the conditions that allow us to enter into samadhi

173
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,720
so we begin with the subtle joy of resting

174
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:27,599
in this clear awareness our gladness to be on the dharma path

175
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:35,440
also naturally allows for joy to arise so when joy is present we see that

176
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:42,720
we notice it we appreciate it and we relax into it

177
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,680
and then joy gives way to tranquility and it's important

178
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,760
to notice tranquility when it's there and then noticing it

179
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,119
can we appreciate the moments of calm can we relax

180
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,480
into the coldness excuse me

181
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,640
and we've seen that when the mind is calm peaceful contentment

182
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,599
naturally arises and so we repeat the practice of noticing

183
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:42,400
appreciating and relaxing into the beautiful feeling of being content

184
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:49,599
with things just as they are this practice helps us to become more

185
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:55,359
familiar with these wholesome states and with familiarity

186
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:03,040
it becomes easier to enter into them but we do need clear awareness when

187
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,880
dwelling in wholesome states because sometimes it can be tempting to get caught

188
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,440
in chasing after these beautiful states of mind but we know that they're conditioned

189
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,839
they come and go so if we can stay

190
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:28,000
soft and relaxed in the well-being of contentment

191
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,920
the door is wide open for samadhi to arise

192
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:43,520
and now i would like to read to you from a beautiful teaching by gil that

193
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,720
he taught when uh

194
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:55,480
he was teaching a course at the institute of buddhist studies in berkeley

195
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,680
on um samadhi

196
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:09,119
gil says to allow yourself to settle into a state that's broad

197
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,400
expansive it helps to be relaxed to have faith

198
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,760
to have some modicum of stability and it helps to be mindful

199
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,760
part of mindfulness is that we start noticing how we're tense stuck

200
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,079
how we have concerns and we find a way to live at peace

201
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,119
conflict-free with whatever arises

202
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,839
and we heal the urge and the wars

203
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:50,160
that exist inside us mindfulness sees all this

204
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,560
and perhaps is able to meet it with kindness friendliness

205
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,359
as our attention settle we settled into being here

206
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:09,359
and we start to feel like it's actually more interesting to be here

207
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:15,280
than to be elsewhere so part of the movement of mindfulness

208
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,599
and samadhi is a clarifying of our interest

209
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,680
if you try to settle on the breath but you have all these thoughts

210
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,200
is that you're more interested in your thoughts it's not easy to convince the mind

211
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:38,640
that it's more interesting to be here distracted thoughts might arise

212
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,000
and we let them fall away and it becomes more interesting to keep

213
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,040
the focus on the safety of the harbor that we're going to

214
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,599
it means that we gather together all the energies and there is a phenomenal sense of

215
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,880
safety to be found in the state of samadhi

216
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,800
we keep coming back letting distractions go and just

217
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,880
settling in with the simplicity of being here

218
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,599
and contentment arises the mind is fully engaged

219
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:30,400
and we have uh the encouragements of joy and happiness

220
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,480
that help us to stay on track it begins to feel so good to be here

221
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,880
and this is very healing work samadhi can move toward deeper and

222
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,720
deeper states of equanimity

223
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,720
so we can develop somebody into a very deep equanimity

224
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,880
where being here and settled is so strong and safe

225
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:07,160
that the mind does not really react to what is going on

226
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:28,960
it's not something to be believed this process

227
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:35,920
it will be revealed to you when you've entered the temple under the tree on your riverbank

228
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,720
and it brings wisdom for how to be in the world

229
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:49,040
doing this deep work and truly being here discovering this samadhi of just being

230
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:56,000
here transforms us into peacemakers in this world

231
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,720
it's not an escape but a sacred preparation of caring for each other

232
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:09,839
in this world we live in so thank you to gil for this

233
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:17,760
samadhi is the condition for liberating insights to arise

234
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:25,440
and we begin to trust the supreme safety of dwelling

235
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:32,920
in a unified mind where no part of us is left out

236
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:44,480
so for the next 24 hours it would be nice

237
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,880
to experiment with these

238
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:57,599
wholesome mind states that allow somebody to arise and when you see one of them

239
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,119
whether it's joy or tranquility or contentment

240
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:08,800
take a moment to notice to appreciate

241
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,880
and to relax into that a little bit and in this way

242
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,640
um you'll become more and more familiar with these mind states and they will

243
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,920
arise more easily

244
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:34,240
so thank you very much for your attention

245
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,078
and thank you for your practice
