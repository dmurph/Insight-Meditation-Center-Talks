29
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,080
here we go great so hello and welcome everyone

30
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,340
lovely to see you beautiful to be with you

31
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,400
um so today I'd like to

32
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:41,340
um invite us to consider oh it's called a um a masquerader of

33
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,860
meta or In classical language in the teachings of meta it's considered a near

34
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:55,080
enemy of meta and that is love with attachment love with attachment with

35
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:04,019
clinging with expectation Etc and a lot of times uh for us

36
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:10,260
um it could actually be a bit of a puzzle what what is meant

37
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:17,579
how can you love how can you love someone without this attachment because of course we're

38
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,220
attached to people that we love and our friends and family how so how does this

39
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:31,620
thing work anyway what's um can you just willy-nilly like not like them kind of be aloof from them

40
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,740
I'm going to say a couple of words and then transition into meditation so that we explore it together

41
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:44,520
so the idea here is um loving without conditions so hear the

42
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:53,520
word attachment is set a sense of expectation of either reciprocity or or

43
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:01,680
or um wanting them expecting them to do something for your love you back it's in

44
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:09,780
a way if you think of generosity of heart think of love as generosity love

45
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:16,620
and care is something that we give really so if you were generous if you were generous to someone with this

46
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,660
expectation with an attachment that oh I'm going to be generous to them so that

47
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:28,560
they're generous back to me um so that I give him a gift oh they give me a gift as well a bigger gift

48
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,440
and not to say there is anything wrong with it it's not a sin it's just it

49
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:41,400
causes um suffering it causes more pain it causes expectations it gets entangled it

50
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,880
gets complicated whereas if you look into your heart and remember a time that

51
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,860
you truly truly gave something maybe a gift maybe something of your resources

52
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,539
you gave money you gave your time you gave your affection your attention

53
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:09,419
with absolutely no expectation um of this being or organization giving

54
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,940
something back to you it was just truly a gift from your heart without a

55
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:21,479
quote-unquote attachment without expectation can see you can feel

56
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:27,780
to your own experience that that was a much Freer much easier much

57
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:33,479
hmm just more Joyful Way To Give

58
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:38,639
So Meta is the same way this idea of metal without attachment or love without

59
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:45,419
attachment whether it's for friends family people we know we don't know Etc it's a sense

60
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:52,500
of care it's a sense of um Good Will friendliness again there's so many nuances

61
00:06:52,500 --> 00:07:01,800
with meta that um you're giving your friendliness without expectation of being paid back

62
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,919
or or being loved back or cared for in return and it's a much

63
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:15,120
um Freer freedom nibana you know these these words are

64
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:22,139
synonyms of one another it's much Freer way to care so that's what I like to

65
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:30,060
invite us to explore and and relate to today in our practice so

66
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:36,300
so with that let's uh let's explore let's sit

67
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:42,979
get into our meditation posture maybe you need to move left and right a bit

68
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:51,060
forward and backwards ah find the center of gravity for your

69
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,940
body maybe roll your shoulders back

70
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,240
and arriving in this body

71
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:11,360
Landing with an open heart

72
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,639
without attachments to outcome

73
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:29,180
as if we give ourselves this gift of this practice

74
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,820
generously with no expectations

75
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,520
happens if you release this tightness of expectation

76
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,820
we don't let go of aspiration which is our values our intentions

77
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:54,060
what uplifts our heart but we let go of expectation

78
00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:00,320
She's Tight demanding limiting

79
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,579
see what happens if you sit if you arrive in this moment

80
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:15,200
generosity of heart towards yourself towards this moment

81
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:25,019
bringing your good will your kindness letting go of expecting how it needs to

82
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:32,069
be letting go of control [Music]

relaxing the Mind relaxing softening see if there is tightening there's

85
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:31,200
expectation if there's a narrative that the mind is clinging to I expect this I

86
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,820
expect that I want this

87
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,279
notice notice

88
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,380
can there be a softening

89
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:59,940
can there at least be a seeing that there's attachment to particular outcome

90
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,459
and nothing else would be good enough

91
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:14,399
relax relax soften Dear Heart oh dear heart there are so many ways to the temple so

92

00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,720
connecting with the sensations of the body of the breath

94
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:59,180

can I still be kind friendly care love without attachment to outcome

101
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,600
I've met her for myself

102
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:14,220
not needing to earn it or do anything to deserve it but just because I exist

103
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:22,220
I'm a human being and it's hard enough to be a human on this Earth

104
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,940
this body this mind this heart can I love it

105

122
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,780
meta for yourself without expectation or attachment

123
00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:00,780
perhaps you can see a loving being a compassionate being or

124
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:09,539
maybe the Buddha or the Quan Yin the paragons of compassion and kindness

125
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:15,840
holding you with kind eyes without expectation of any outcome

any particular way we want them to behave see if it's possible for even a single

140
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,539
second and if it becomes challenging then come

141
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:51,740
back to yourself and receive it from your compassionate person

145
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:39,000
are that you may not approve of or like but not condoning them but can you

wish them well unconditionally

147
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:08,059
they too are doing the best they can even the causes and conditions

148
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,440
that has brought them to this point in their life

thanks everyone everybody's back welcome back

166
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:37,320
and uh would love to hear from you what was the exploration like what they

167
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,659
should discover either as you're exploring or or um

168
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:49,559
as as you're meditating any aha moments or any challenges or

169
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:57,720
um Peter uh your guidance uh allowed me to be

170
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,360
able to more um uh when the second time came around I

171
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,460
I my mind was blank I didn't think I had anything to say but I guess between past

172
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,679
history and your um your guidance about guidelines uh I

173
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:22,620
said let me start talking and see what comes and wow it was useful to voice it and and just

174
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:28,020
be vulnerable and and find where where I was at that I didn't know

175
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:33,120
that's nice beautiful oh that makes me happy to know

176
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,240
and Peter thanks so much for sharing this this is when small groups are

177
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:45,659
so powerful really powerful in the way of allowing one just as you explore as

178
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:50,820
you explained to explore for your own sake you're not speaking for the sake of

179
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:57,419
others but you become surprised wow you go deeper in your understanding and your

180
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:04,380
Insight exactly as you shared I'm so delighted that you you decided to give

181
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:09,419
it a try okay let me give it a try let me explore for my own sake and that you

182
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:15,000
felt safe enough also with in your group to do that

183
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,360
thanks to them as well to offer that to you beautiful yay thanks for that that's

184
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:29,299
lovely makes me so happy yeah um no please

185
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:36,600
thanks Nikki um in our group tonight I think there was a great piece of advice that or not

186
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:42,000
advice but I think a teaching arose um from from one of the the people that

187
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,220
shared which uh which I found really really beneficial so when when I was thinking about

188
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:54,059
conditional love it has all these layers all this complication all of these conditions and uh the teaching that was

189
00:32:54,059 --> 00:33:00,120
shared was this practice of waking up in the morning and saying how are you doing buddy and just that lightness and that

190
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:06,600
ease and that uncomplicated relationship I think it just kind of clicked and it made so much sense that you know things

191
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:13,559
don't have to be so complicated you know we make them complicated so why not just be kind

192
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:20,940
eat thank you for sharing that thank you for sharing that wisdom from your group this this lightness right because these

193
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:26,340
layers of conditionality make it kind of heavy like like a lead balloon it's just

194
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:33,659
it's heavy whereas you take the lead out you just let it be light as a balloon with something like oh yeah how are you

195
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:41,340
doing buddy just oh this expression of care I love it I love it how beautiful thanks love very sweet

196
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:46,380
oh oh open for for any other Reflections

197
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:52,500

198
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:58,140
reflections without your name and I'm glad that uh you found the

199
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:04,340
comments about crosstalk helpful this is great makes me happy Jesse

200
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:14,280
yeah thanks thank you for this guidance and this teaching today I appreciate you mentioning like the images of the Buddha

201
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:20,520
or like just kind of more neutral images that are much easier for me to work with images of a Buddhist statue and I also

202
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:26,040
used like a single blade of grass just growing from the ground just like

203
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,560
plants kind of blossoming and flowering and like seeking towards the light and

204
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:37,138
somehow to me that's that's like a a visual of unconditional love even though

205
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:43,138
I'm not sure maybe not other people would see it that way but somehow it just resonates as it's just like a

206
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:48,300
growth towards the Sun oh beautiful thanks for bringing this in

207
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:54,960
Jesse what oh that that uplifts my heart and as you were saying that also something else came to my mind as I was

208
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,720
looking actually in the image behind me the sunflowers because they're so happy right they're just unconditionally

209
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,940
smiling at you no matter who or what you are they're just loving you right that's

210
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:12,660
what I love about sunflowers they make me happy so that's the same scent so I I guess I could have suggested

211
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:17,720
um blade of grass as well as sunflowers

212
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,900
yeah thanks for bringing that in that's great beautiful

213
