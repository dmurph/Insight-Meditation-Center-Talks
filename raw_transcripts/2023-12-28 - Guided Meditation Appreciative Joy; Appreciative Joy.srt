1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,399
good day everyone and welcome to the morning

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:14,120
sitting as we continue our week um with these wholesome qualities of Mind known

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:22,000
as the Divine abodes or Brahma vihara we are building on a foundation of meta or

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,439
Goodwill loving kindness yesterday we were focused on

5
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,760
how Goodwill that meets suffering responds with compassion with

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,960
caring and today we'll focus on how good will that meets happiness responds with

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,160
appreciative Joy also called sympathetic joy in other words we're happy for the

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,440
Good Fortune of others and we want to see their happiness

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,559
continue the mind that can be happy uh at others happiness and not caught

10
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,479
caught up in jealousy or competition is a mind that can come to

11
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:13,520
freedom from dissatisfaction stress and

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,400
suffering this is a mental state by the way that's really different from

13
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:27,040
complacency it's not just that we're okay we're actually uh feeling happy and

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,880
there's an availability of peace with respect to the way life works you know sometimes people are happy sometimes

15
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:42,439
they're unhappy sometimes we have UPS sometimes we have downs and appreciative Joy does not mean

16
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:49,040
that we give up any motivation to help those who are not so

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,880
fortunate it means we see how life has this disparity a human

18
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,600
culture uh creates disparities and we have compassion for the way that affects

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,800
people we see how privilege operates and we're able to use whatever

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,000
gifts that come our way not just for our own pleasure but to support wholesome

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,400
action in the world whether that action is very local where you live or has a

22
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,480
bigger reach um so sympathetic Joy is this beautiful quality

23
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:39,120
and skill that has strength and it's also able to offer strength to

24
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,879
others so with that we'll begin our formal

25
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:56,959
meditation taking time to find the posture that supports

26
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,799
you perhaps to take some longer deeper

27
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:11,560
breaths and release any obvious tension or anything

28
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
extra

29
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,879
as you take these deliberate breaths bringing energy into the body with the

30
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:45,640
in breath and

31
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,280
releasing with the out

32
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,680
breath notice what's arising in Awareness right

33
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,760
now in the

34
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,040
mind the

35
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,799
heart what's arising in the

36
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:33,360
body and taking some time to bring any ease or

37
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:41,479
softening that's available to any area of

38
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,039
preoccupation any area of

39
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
difficulty

40
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,879
and perhaps allowing yourself to feel the presence of

41
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:25,319
aliveness Vitality energy in the

42
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,639
body you might feel it in Brea in the

43
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,639
breathing in and

44
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:58,160
out or in the warmth and coolness of different areas of the

45
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
body

46
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,000
you might feel pulsing or vibration in the

47
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
body

48
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:46,199
noticing any good feelings in any area of the body the Heart

49
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,599
Center even if some areas are uncomfortable there may be other areas

50
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:01,400
that feel good that feel some ease

51
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:25,599
perhaps sending yourself the silent wish may the Vitality of this body

52
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
continue

53
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:44,879
allowing yourself to feel any positive physical

54
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,639
emotional mental feelings that are

55
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
present

56
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:12,039
and noticing states of heart and mind that accompany various Sensations in the

57
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,760
body appreciating in any supportive emotions or

58
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:41,919
thoughts the presence of any happiness or Joy or

59
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:57,360
contentment appreciating all that arises whether difficult or

60
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,320
joyful it's all in information that awareness is allowing

61
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,399
us to see as it arises as it stays for a

62
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,760
while as it

63
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,880
passes this morning for those who would like I'll offer a guided practice of

64
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:32,200
appreciative Joy you can feel free to part participate or if this does not fit

65
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,600
where your practice is this morning letting the sound of my voice Fade Into

66
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,640
the background and continuing with what it what you need in your

67
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:53,720
practice today we can experiment with feeling appreciative joy for a good

68
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,399
friend or someone for whom some aspect of life is going going

69
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,079
well right

70
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:11,360
now when you're ready bringing this person to

71
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,720
mind and imagining their face glowing with

72
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,959
happiness and seeing them on the receiving end of Good

73
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:52,680
Fortune perhaps silently receiving or repeating phrases of appreciative joy in

74
00:10:52,680 --> 00:11:02,519
the mind I'll offer some and you may have some that spontaneous ly occur to you as

75
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,160
well I'm happy that you're

76
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:19,079
happy I take joy in your good

77
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,959
fortune may your happiness continue and

78
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:54,240
grow may you grow in happiness peace and

79
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
freedom

80
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:14,720
continuing on your own with the phrases that speak to you or simply feeling the

81
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,160
heart filling with appreciative joy and perhaps metaphorically sending

82
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:27,880
that to the person whose happiness you are

83
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,240
appreciating may your happiness continue and

84
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:45,120
grow may you grow in happiness peace and

85
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
freedom

86
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
for

87
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:49,159
so mudita is the poly word for appreciative joy and it's sometimes

88
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:57,240
translated as empathetic Joy or sympathetic joy and it's what Goodwill or meta feel

89
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:03,639
feels when it encounters happiness it wants the happiness of

90
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:10,080
others and and oneself to continue um perhaps it's easiest to feel

91
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:19,200
for yourself or the people that you love or like um if we interestingly if we fear

92
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,720
deprivation or we've unconsciously harbored some idea that there's a

93
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,200
limited supply of happiness um in such a way that if it goes to

94
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:37,639
someone else or people we don't like there will be less for us so sometimes people feel competitive

95
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:43,799
about good fortune or even feel Envy um when someone else receives something

96
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:49,200
that they want for themselves but of course we can always contemplate does

97
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:56,480
another person's happiness diminish yours what ideas or attitudes might

98
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:04,760
underly that what experiences might be behind that um at another time when you you are

99
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:10,279
happy how would it be for you to know that others resented you or begrudged

100
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:17,480
your happiness it' be pretty uncomfortable yeah so there's no need to judge

101
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:23,480
ourselves or others in this practice we can take into account that um we

102
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:31,480
ourselves and people who have some wisdom have had sometime or other behaved

103
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,880
unskillfully and that people uh have been harmed by

104
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:44,720
that also that people who have harmed others including any time we may have done some harm at other times have been

105
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,360
good to someone else so a lot of this is about

106
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:57,039
separating unskillful behavior from the person themselves and realizing how big

107
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:03,559
big a role conditioning plays in unskillful behavior and that can help us realize

108
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:10,720
that appreciative joy for someone else's happiness really gets to the root

109
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:17,679
of their potential as a human being um we can think about them as an innocent

110
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:24,960
baby to whom events then happened so sending wishes for continued

111
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:32,240
happiness to their inner potential in a way to grow into a skillful kind person

112
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:40,799
and sending that to ourselves as well that person or or this person with

113
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,760
this potential sending that person the appreciative Joy just as we would want

114
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:52,559
to receive sympathetic Joy when things go well for ourselves despite the fact

115
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,799
that we're imperfect perhaps including the wish

116
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:05,720
that someday we and others will be freed from

117
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:12,000
suffering towards genuine sustainable happiness in the

118
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,919
Dharma we may struggle with the realization that some have been born into privilege or currently enjoy

119
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:26,599
some good fortune While others are deprived of resources for even the most

120
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:34,200
basic B needs water food shelter love in light of this it's really helpful to

121
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:40,480
remember equinity you know like a balanced mind and a wise

122
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,320
View and that wise view includes the recognition that actions have

123
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,919
consequences all human actions have

124
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:58,040
consequences so there are consequences from inequity

125
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:05,040
and the correction of it is probably not happening anywhere near as quickly as we

126
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,400
want but equinity together with sympathetic Joy

127
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,560
compassion and Goodwill or loving kindness can help us remain

128
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:25,720
constructive while we're aware of the imbalance uh between those who have happy circumstances and those who

129
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:33,520
don't appreciative Joy has this wonderful quality as do all the brah viharas of

130
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:41,200
helping us see that happiness creates more happiness each of these Brahma viharas

131
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,200
Foster an increase in themselves in the world so if we offer kindness kindness

132
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,079
is more likely to be offered in return if we offer compassion that's likely to

133
00:35:53,079 --> 00:36:00,079
grow around us and happiness becomes more more abundant when we celebrate

134
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:08,240
Good Fortune when it comes along and you know when any uh of these

135
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,319
Brahma viharas including appreciative Joy when it feels difficult to

136
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:21,480
access it's always useful and skillful to wish that we could send wishes of one

137
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:28,079
of these qualities so for example may I open to the happiness I see in others

138
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:36,839
that's a wish to have access to appreciative joy and we can balance any reactivity

139
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:43,839
with our capacity to think wise thoughts for example I know that uh things that

140
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:50,440
people get through crime or uh malfeasance don't

141
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:57,319
last I see that human life is short I see that sooner or later

142
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:04,400
suffering and sorrow come to everyone and and most importantly may I

143
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,079
not begrudge a few passing moments of happiness in this life

144
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:16,040
it's not as abundant as we wish it were sometimes so this practice of

145
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:23,119
appreciative Joy uh by the way is of course supported by these other Brahma viharas maybe you

146
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:30,640
felt that you know when there's kindness and Goodwill happiness grows when there's compassion

147
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,920
and care for others happiness is then a possibility

148
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:43,440
again each one strengthens and supports others and I want to read you an excerpt

149
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,599
from an essay by a monastic nanica Tera

150
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,720
and he was someone who lived in the last century a german-born terava Buddhist

151
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,400
monk and Scholar um after he ordained in Sri Lanka he

152
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,760
later became the co-founder of the Buddhist publication Society authored a

153
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:12,800
ton of books and articles and he mentored and taught a whole generation of Western Buddhist

154
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:20,000
leaders for example Bodi and many of us who have read you know many of the sutas

155
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,720
translated by bod will appreciate how important that is since he's done so

156
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:31,720
many translations s on which those of us who speak English now depend for our

157
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:40,400
information about the original Buddhist sutas or as close to them as we can get

158
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,440
so nanaka wrote compassion

159
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:52,920
prevents love and sympathetic Joy from forgetting that while we are enjoying or

160
00:38:52,920 --> 00:39:00,240
giving temporary and limited happiness there still exist at that time the most

161
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:07,119
Dreadful states of suffering in the world it reminds them that our happiness

162
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,839
coexists with measureless misery perhaps at the next

163
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:20,119
doorstep it's a reminder to love and sympathetic joy that there's more suffering in the world than we are able

164
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:26,920
to help mitigate and that after the effect of such mitigation has vanished sorrow and

165
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:34,319
pain are sure to arise a new until suffering is uprooted entirely at the

166
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:42,440
attainment of nibana so this is one of the roles of compassion compassion does not allow

167
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,960
that love and sympathetic Joy shut themselves off against the wide world by

168
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,440
confining themselves to just one narrow sector compassion prevents love and

169
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:00,520
sympathetic Joy from turning into States of selfsat satisfied complacency within some jealously

170
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:07,839
guarded Petty kind of Happiness compassion stir and urges love

171
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:15,839
and he's referring to meta here to widen its sphere it stirs and urges sympathetic

172
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,920
joy to search for fresh nourishment nourishment not not be complacent and

173
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,280
stuck in one moment it helps both of them to grow

174
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,560
into truly boundless States like The Meta that I read to you earlier this

175
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:40,560
week was encouraging boundless loving kindness sympathetic Joy holds

176
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,960
compassion back from being overwhelmed at the side of the world suffering from

177
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,119
being absorbed by it to the exclusion of everything else it keeps us from falling

178
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:58,400
into grief constant grief sympathetic Joy relieves tension of Mind sues the

179
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:05,119
painful burning of the Compassionate Heart it keeps compassion away from

180
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:11,200
melancholic brooding without purpose from a feudal sentimentality that merely

181
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:17,599
weakens and consumes the strength of mind and heart sympathetic Joy develops

182
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,079
compassion into active

183
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:31,960
sympathy sympathetic Joy gives to equinity the mild Serenity that softens

184
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:39,240
its Stern appearance it is the Divine smile on the face of the Buddha a smile

185
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:44,319
that persists in spite of his deep knowledge of the world's suffering a

186
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:49,359
smile that gives Solace and hope fearlessness and

187
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:56,319
confidence wide open are the doors to Deliverance it it says so that's what

188
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:03,560
anapon Tera reminded us of and that is how these qualities balance one

189
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:09,560
another as you practice appreciative Joy you'll

190
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:14,960
probably notice maybe you just noticed that it has an energizing capacity it

191
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:24,319
can lighten our hearts and that's skillful to keep in mind when you find your heart sinking into sadness at the

192
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:31,119
suffering in the world G grief sympathetic Joy

193
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:37,160
benefits tremendously from continual grounding in

194
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,359
mindfulness and that's the way that it won't kind of Veer into giddiness or

195
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:47,720
kind of overe excitation uh which isn't really the aim of this

196
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:54,839
practice it can be a calm kind of appreciation or joy and it doesn't need

197
00:42:54,839 --> 00:43:00,880
excitement to flourish so I hope for those of you who are

198
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:07,640
enjoying these practices uh that you perhaps use today to touch

199
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:14,880
into appreciative Joy noticing happiness around you noticing happiness inside you

200
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:22,480
and being able to take a few moments to feel that and enjoy
