1
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,740
so warm hello and I'm quite happy to be

2
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:24,480
both sitting here in my meditation posture and also to be here with all of you and

3
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,779
be able to share my meditation in a sense with you and do

4
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:38,000
this together so welcome everyone

5
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,519
the topic for this week's Dharma talks is

6
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:51,420
compassion and for those who meditate people who

7
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:59,040
meditate compassion the source of compassion or the reference point for compassion

8
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,940
is maybe very different than people most people who don't meditate

9
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:13,620
that I think when you when we do mindfulness meditation and discover how to really be present

10
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,740
for oneself so as not to be hindered by

11
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:26,519
doubt and ill will and desires and distractions to really learn how to sit here present

12
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:34,079
really present in the present moment with a sense of um well-being

13
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,100
or a sense of openness and kind of a groundedness in the present

14
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,440
that that groundedness in the presence in the sense of well-being that can come from that

15
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:53,779
sense of ease that can come from that that's the same

16
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,740
door the doorway for that the door that that opens is a doorway for compassion

17
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:07,380
another way another words compassion isn't something that

18
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:14,700
for if from that in Buddhist point of view it's something that comes along with or is built on

19
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:21,240
a deep sense of eat at ease that one has with oneself with one life

20
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,120
an ease that comes from not being caught in hindrances and cotton attachments and

21
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:34,800
clinging it's kind of like the the very

22
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,040
open presence that is the doorway for

23
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,480
well-being for oneself is also the doorway

24
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:52,639
for the compassionate concern or compassionate

25
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:58,940
response to the suffering of the world

26
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,459
and in the sense maybe that's one of the gifts of meditation practice

27
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:11,820
is to provide compassion with a kind of simplicity

28
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:19,860
or an absence of clinging an absence of hindrances an absence of the things that

29
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,519
get mixed up with compassion to cause distress

30
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:33,860
distressed compassion stress compassion so we'll sit here

31
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,959
uh with maybe if you wish with the idea

32
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:45,620
that we're opening up to our potential for

33
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:51,540
compassionate presence but we do it indirectly

34
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:58,560
that we're doing it by really being here curious interested

35
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,440
valuing with deep respect

36
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:11,760
for what it's like to be really here and present as if it's the doorway

37
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:19,680
to compassion the doorway to love without trying for it to be compassion

38
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:27,440
just stepping into the store away of Here and Now

39
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:34,700
so taking a meditation posture

40
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,839
and gently closing your eyes

41
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:50,899
and taking a couple of moments here

42
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:56,839
to see if you could establish an attitude

43
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:06,000
of valuing

44
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,180
your embodied experience now

45
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:18,899
valuing being in the present moment

46
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:26,760
rather than being in a kind of virtual reality of ideas and thoughts

47
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:32,360
that are about the future or the past or fantasy

48
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,040
or about other places than right here

49
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:47,699
so an attitude of willingness

50
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:54,500
to be present here

51
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:20,959
and then to take a few long slow deep breaths

52
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:30,000
as if you're breathing you're deep breathing is inviting you welcoming you

53
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,820
here in this body at this time

54
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:42,480
inviting you into the present moment and the long exhale

55
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,959
is a releasing a temporary releasing of your thoughts

56
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:55,500
and concerns and worries maybe imagining that you're putting

57
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:03,660
those things up on a Shelf and you can pick them up again after the meditation but for now

58
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:11,178
maybe you can accept the invitation the welcoming

59
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,660
to being here with this body at this time

60
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,740
and then letting your breathing return to normal

61
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:40,460
taking a few moments to relax your body further

62
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:48,720
the tensions of your face allowing them to soften

63
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,760
allowing the face to melt

64
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:08,600
as you exhale allowing the shoulders to soften

65
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,659
relax

66
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:22,400
allowing the shoulders to dissolve the tension that's there

67
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,700
softening the belly

68
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:45,200
giving some freedom to the belly

69
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:53,520
freedom to relax and hang forward hang down

70
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,480
to settle

71
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:12,960
and then as if you can take a loving hand and reach deep down inside of yourself

72
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:20,600
to the deepest place that's there in you to gently touch

73
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:28,799
with the deepest place that you can find and as you exhale

74
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,159
to relax the deepest places of tension

75
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,460
relax around the deepest places that you know you can feel

76
00:19:53,460 --> 00:20:01,500
and then there's a can be a wonderful feeling that only is present in the

77
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:11,360
present moment which is a gentle tenderness softness Within

78
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:19,799
and perhaps you could now be tenderly aware

79
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:23,299
of your body breathing

80
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:37,080
or maybe the breath is tender and to hear being touched tenderly by

81
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,440
breathing

82
00:20:52,559 --> 00:21:00,380
being touched differently by the inhale then the exhale

83
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:14,940
with the sensations of the body breathing

84
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,280
being a welcome an imitation for you

85
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,679
to be present for those experiences

86
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,320
noticing if your thinking mind takes you away from the present moment

87
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,980
takes you away from a deeper connection to hear to yourself

88
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,960
and if you notice that it does so and you can feel the difference between

89
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,980
being connected to yourself and not connected

90
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:38,460
choose being connected don't allow them thinking the

91
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,519
distractions to choose for you

92
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:52,220
choose to stay connected Here and Now do the body breathing

93
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:10,100
as you exhale relaxing the thinking muscle the thinking mind

94
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:18,419
softening the energy and the waves of thinking as if thinking are waves on the sea

95
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:22,880
let the waves quiet and listen

96
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:38,640
her present moment can be a door to discovering

97
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:45,980
he well-being sense of ease within you

98
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:52,559
not always easy to discover but maybe if you turn up the corners of

99
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:59,899
your lips a little bit for a little half smile quarter smile

100
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,620
perhaps it'd be a little bit easier to discover some feeling of well-being

101
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:13,440
however mild with being here and now

102
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:23,299
some pleasure and then to breathe with that well-being

103
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:33,539
let the well-being be whatever small it is to guide you

104
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:39,320
into a fuller connection to your body breathing

105
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:58,278
breathing with whatever sense of well-being or pleasure that might be here

106
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:07,320
in spite of whatever discomfort you might have notice what's too comfortable or

107
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:14,059
comforting Here and Now breathe with it

108
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:22,940
and as you breathe especially on the exhale let go of your thoughts

109
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:31,919
let the thinking mind become Stiller and more open and attentive

110
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,360
to hear and now

111
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:48,240
with the exhale settling in further into your

112
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,860
body into your being

113
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:01,220
with the exhale letting go into your

114
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:09,740
physical existence right now and on the inhale

115
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:18,358
to feel whatever goodness rightness

116
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:25,560
well-being might be

117
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,520
within you

118
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:35,060
letting go of striving and trying

119
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,260
more allowing yourself to feel and be present

120
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:51,020
allowing your body your breathing to come to you and

121
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:56,059
to Simply Let It Be

122
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:11,900
it might there be within you

123
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,700
someplace location for compassion

124
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,980
might there be some tenderness some warmth some love

125
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:32,359
within you however small and small hint

126
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,420
of something that feels a bit like the presence of

127
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:45,720
compassion a warmth

128
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,640
a kindness a love

129
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:09,119
something very simple that if it had words it would

130
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,839
wish you well and for you to be free of suffering

131
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,960
but it's so simple it has no words

132
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,079
it's just a attitude of feeling here

133
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:34,760
free of desires free of clinging a need

134
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,400
free of fear and worry

135
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,740
just a simple Inner Glow

136
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:53,220
of compassionate warmth wanting nothing

137
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:59,960
and for these minutes doing nothing just an attitude

138
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:13,079
breathing with that attitude having this attitude of compassion

139
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:19,819
guide you to a simple presence with the breathing

140
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:26,420
and then as we come to the end of this meditation

141
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:40,320
to feel perhaps your ability to be open and attentive and aware

142
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:47,599
of the world around you the people in your lives

143
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,700
people of your neighborhood and

144
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:05,480
in your wider community and across the lands

145
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:20,280
and then to see if the ten tender gentle attitude

146
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,859
of compassionate warmth warm compassion

147
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:34,380
that needs nothing is distressed by nothing just a warmth

148
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:42,440
just care a tenderness that's open

149
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:52,740
and have this attitude of Compassion Care love

150
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:58,440
warmth radiate from you

151
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,078
as if it could spread across the lands

152
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,780
that your compassion can be inclusive of all beings

153
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,940
breathing in and breathing out

154
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:40,339
and as we come there now to the very end of the sitting

155
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,960
to consider or to hold all beings

156
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:56,099
in your wish for their well-being may all beings

157
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:03,740
be happy may all beings

158
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,599
be safe and healthy

159
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:16,460
may all beings be free

160
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,780
and may it be that on this day

161
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,320
that you share your compassion with someone else

162
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:39,240
very simple compassion maybe not with any words

163
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:46,640
but with your presence your attention your interest in them

164
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:54,020
your kindness your well-wishing

165
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,260
may all beings everywhere be happy

166
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:17,409
[Music]

167
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:28,980
so now in this continuing with this second talk on compassion karuna

168
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:36,960
um the so maybe as I said yesterday there are maybe many different definitions of confession and

169
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,060
maybe there are many forms of compassion as there are people

170
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:49,440
that compassion as wonderful it is and profound as it is we should be very careful not to put it

171
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:58,740
into like there's one thing we know what compassion is and um but even so in the range of what

172
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:04,220
compassion can be that the Buddhist idea of karuna

173
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:11,700
k-a-r-u-n-a has its own flavor its own particular way of being or aspect that's

174
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:18,420
I think quite worthwhile to learning and understanding this flavor of compassion

175
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:27,839
and um I don't know exactly if it's the case but I have been told or read that the

176
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:35,280
word karuna comes from the same root as the word karma meaning action

177
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,800
and um and that somehow in the pre-bootest time karuna referred to

178
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,500
something called sacred action a kind of special action which then

179
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:54,119
maybe the Buddha or the religious world of his time um uh you utilized to refer to something

180
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:59,640
that's close to what we call compassion but one of the characteristics of this

181
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:06,119
of the Buddha is this discussion about karuna is that he primarily talked about it as

182
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:13,680
something that's cultivated and experienced in meditation he had another word called anukampa

183
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,980
which was the expression of care maybe compassion that is translated into how

184
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:26,880
we act in the world act with Care Act with compassion but this very important word karuna as

185
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:34,260
primarily something that is cultivated in meditation discovered in meditation for many of us

186
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:40,079
and what makes that special I think is that meditation is a place where we're

187
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,599
settling in to discover how to be free of the hindrances

188
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:51,800
among other things to be free of ill will and to be free of compulsive desire

189
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:58,740
free of sloth torpor restlessness anxiety regrets and doubt

190
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:04,859
to be to discover how to not have any clingings to be deeply at ease and at

191
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:11,880
peace here and the whole experience of encountering suffering or being concerned with the

192
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:18,599
suffering of oneself and with others when the hindrances and clinging are not there or not in the Forefront not

193
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:24,060
complicating it gives compassion a very unique flavor

194
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:31,859
it's a compassion then that is free of tension free free of clinging

195
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:38,940
free of the distress that arises because of clinging and in particular one of the forms of uh

196
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:44,880
distress that can be born out of you know together with compassion out of contact with suffering

197
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:51,540
is related to all the ways in which we cling to self all the ways in which the

198
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:57,000
self is wounded or hurt or easily triggered or made of made frightened

199
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,619
and when this sense of self gets rectified gets harmonized gets softened

200
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:09,839
gets kind of dissolves in this wonderful field of

201
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:15,119
Good Will of meditation then um self and self-concern

202
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:21,540
self-preoccupation egotism is not it doesn't get tied up in

203
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:27,240
the compassion and so compassion then becomes free of

204
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:32,700
What's called the near enemy of compassion near enemy is

205
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:39,440
something that looks like compassion but isn't and sometimes it's called um pity

206
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:46,079
that we feel pity for people or certain kind of distressed feeling of

207
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:52,619
horror or alarm we really feel strongly motivated and concerned and caught in

208
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:58,740
the experience of suffering the suffering of others and we might call it and we worry about people and we might

209
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:05,160
call that compassion but maybe it's not quite compassionate looks like compassion but it isn't that kind of

210
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:10,579
karuna compassion this karuna that the reference point is this deep sense of

211
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:16,020
inner well-being and if we have that sense of well-being

212
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:21,060
and happiness within that comes from letting go of clinging and letting go of

213
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:26,160
self preoccupation then one of the kind of confusions

214
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:32,099
around compassion um uh is that if we're compassionate

215
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:37,260
we're altruistic that we we don't have any concern with

216
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:44,280
ourselves and we just give ourselves completely over to caring for other people as if we don't matter and it's

217
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:50,880
fine for us to stay up you know all night and exhaust ourselves and do it you know do whatever we can because

218
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:58,200
we're supposed to be compassionate but when the reference point is the source of well-being and meditation

219
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:04,400
then it becomes obvious that we're harming ourselves when we

220
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,560
don't give any attention to ourselves and so the compassion this karuna and

221
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:17,520
Buddhism is not an altruistic compassion but it's also not a selfish compassion

222
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:23,220
it's a compassion that kind of glow I like to think of it as as a glowing from

223
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:28,859
the inside from our heart outwards and it takes care of the first human

224
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:35,400
being that it encounters for glowing from the heart and the first

225
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,980
human being that this Compassionate Care encounters will be yourself

226
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:46,079
everything between your from the center of your heart outwards

227
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:53,220
and so that also is uh warrants this care This Love This Good Will this

228
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:59,579
wanting to you know to feel and uh to wanting well-being for you yourself

229
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:04,920
and it flows out from there because as we get centered nothing gets stuck

230
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:10,800
nothing gets limited these feelings these attitudes there's an openness that

231
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:17,819
is inclusive of the world around us and others but it's not the inclusion and a concern

232
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:23,220
for others where we lose touch with what's here because this karuna flows

233
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:29,280
from the heart through us out into the world and so the sense of well-being

234
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:37,859
in meditation for example that allows us to connect to the heart is the very well-being or openness the

235
00:49:37,859 --> 00:49:44,839
well-being that allows us compassion to flow outwards and so one of the characteristics of

236
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:51,960
karuna that I mentioned yesterday is that it does not tied up in sorrow it's

237
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:58,380
not tied up in distress it doesn't we don't take it on as a burden but actually there's a feeling of

238
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:04,440
lightness or Sweetness in this even though the heart might be broken it

239
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,480
might be you know there's things my heart gets broken regularly with the

240
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:16,020
suffering of the world and what people tell me they've experienced in their life or what I read in the news or

241
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:22,440
anything and uh there have been times when I've sobbed after reading the news because of

242
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:29,640
what I see there but I don't feel that uh I'm distressed and I don't feel like that I'm upset or

243
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:36,660
that I feel sorrow exactly I just feel uh deeply like heartbroken and

244
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:41,819
maybe sad without sorrow or sorrow without sad a kind of feeling of

245
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:47,700
poignant feeling that has no clinging to it has not it's not self-preoccupation

246
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:54,599
it's not feeling sorry for myself or feeling distressed in myself I'm quite welcoming and willing to have

247
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:59,940
my heart broken and feel this kind of poignant kind of I don't know what to call that

248
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:07,859
sadness in the world but uh but it's not a it has no weight to it and and uh it has no I don't feel

249
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:14,880
like I'm suffering with it and so uh this compassion this karuna

250
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,579
that is not altruistic but is not self-centered

251
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:27,119
where we ourselves are as important to care for as anyone else and so there's a

252
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:34,800
balance then in the compassion with um kind of in self-care and other care

253
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:42,720
um the Buddhists tend not to like to use the word self-care because it's such a magnet for self-preoccupation and the

254
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:49,440
idea of self-centeredness is so powerful that even our language we probably should be

255
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:56,700
a little bit careful with so that we don't kind of it doesn't become a magnet for self-concern

256
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:02,760
but as we kind of can begin to discover this inner capacity for compassion the

257
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:08,940
karuna that comes from letting go of distraction clinging the hindrances and

258
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:15,740
as I keep saying for many of us it starts in meditation then

259
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:21,839
the very compassion is in a field in a context

260
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:28,980
of certain degree of Freedom or ease or absence of clinging that itself

261
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:36,180
supports all kinds of transformations and so compassion with compassion and

262
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:41,359
this deep letting go of the hindrances and selfishness

263
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:49,140
resentment can turn to forgiveness uh hostility can turn into friendliness

264
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:56,940
and anger can turn into kindness that compassion is a force

265
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:04,140
that prompts or encourages the movement of letting go further clinging why hold

266
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:09,180
on to anything when we keep hurting ourselves if we hold on to it jealousies

267
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:15,059
are holding on hostilities are holding on ill will is a whole holding on

268
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:20,160
and this combination of this connection to this deeper well-being and this

269
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:26,640
compassion is like a medicine or like a bomb that transforms uh these places

270
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:33,800
that are tough and hard inside of us and whether that's hostility to ourselves or to others whether it's

271
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:40,800
being destroyed you know angry with ourselves critical ourselves or others all the different ways we suffer if

272
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:46,160
we're deeply afraid or deeply hurt to meet that with this softness and

273
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:53,280
compassion and kindness and non-clinging to meet ourself

274
00:53:53,280 --> 00:54:00,900
suffering with that part of us it's not self-preoccupied to be able to be present in a loving and

275
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:08,000
careful way and so the um

276
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:15,980
so one of the things that meditation does for many of us is that

277
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:23,339
it does help us meet our own suffering and it isn't this and partly really

278
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:28,380
knowing our own suffering helps us to understand the suffering of others better

279
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:35,460
but um and so that helps us to have compassion for them but uh it's also that as we understand

280
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:41,099
ourselves better we understand how we get uh how the complications that might

281
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:49,500
arise when we're encountering others when we give birth to the near enemies of of uh Compassion or the What's called

282
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:57,920
the far enemies of compassion which is um the horror or deep distress or even

283
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:03,599
the Far Far enemy of his cruelty and some people will respond to distress in

284
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:10,440
the world it's so painful and so unacceptable to be present for it they just want to push it away and sometimes

285
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:16,559
even in forms of Cruelty so um

286
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:22,700
so the reference point for karuna this particular kind of compassion

287
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:30,359
in the teachings of the Buddha is meditation practice and hopefully when we get over time as

288
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:37,800
we discover the freedom that comes with meditation and how that can give rise to a certain kind of compassion that's very

289
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:44,599
clean that maybe it's compassion that's kind of like a purified gold that's kind of

290
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:50,400
uh purified all the dross and all the impurities that can come along with it

291
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,859
then we understand that compassion doesn't diminish us compassion doesn't

292
00:55:55,859 --> 00:56:03,660
is not stressful in and of itself that it's not sharing in the suffering

293
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:12,119
of others in the sense of feeling their suffering so we feel it the same way but rather it's uh feeling being with

294
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:17,520
their suffering with a tenderness and a care and a concern and empathy where we

295
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:24,480
are bringing this soft tender attitude of care and love to meet them and care

296
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:30,420
for people and support them and be their friends to be with them

297
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:36,000
and in this way it said that if you want to be happy

298
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:43,140
in your life be compassionate easier said than done but the reference

299
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:48,740
point for this little saying is this karuna that we

300
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:56,040
we discover or evoke or develop in the freedom from clinging the freedom from

301
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:01,680
the hindrances that the that meditation can lead to if we can really be present

302
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:07,020
here and if we can't be fully present here

303
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:13,980
then it's a wonderful thing to be compassionate for that to be caring and

304
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:19,140
loving for all the challenges we have and because sometimes it's through

305
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:25,079
compassion that we finally learn how to really be present here for our lived

306
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:33,480
experience so um I hope that you will

307
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:40,440
spend some time with uh thinking about exploring reflecting on the relationship

308
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:48,300
between compassion and the absence of clinging the absence of self-centeredness

309
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:57,019
but with the presence of self-love so thank you all very much
