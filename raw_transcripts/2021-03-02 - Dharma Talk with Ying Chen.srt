1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,520
so um

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,560
what i had in mind to share today

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,600
tonight

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,880
um is that i finished

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,120
a chanting retreat last week

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,880
there was still quite a lot of energy

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,840
reverberating in me

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,600
from this chanting retreat

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,760
so i thought i'd share some reflections

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,960
on one of the things

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,720
that stood out for me that is

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,160
taking refuge in the buddha

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,200
dharma and sangha

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,360
and that is often called the triple jam

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,239
some of you probably know this and then

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,719
probably have done this multiple times

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,840
and i just want to um maybe just chant

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,840
to this apolly chant

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,478
right now for everyone and

20
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,560
maybe share a little reflection about

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,600
the sense of taking refuges

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,240
in the buddha dharma and sangha

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,080
and so the pali chant goes like this

24
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,840
[Music]

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
uh

26
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:35,760
[Music]

27
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,920
[Music]

28
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,119
and it often times get translated as

29
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,720
i take refuge in the buddha

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,240
i take refuge in the dharma

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,720
and i take refuge in the sangha

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,240
and this um the typical form

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,479
is to chant this three times

34
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,399
and so on as a chanting retreat

35
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,760
and we chanted this multiple times

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,720
and taking those refugees are often done

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,440
formally

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,599
in a ceremony when one commits

39
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,200
to become a buddhist

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,400
to walk the dharma path

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,319
a teacher may initiate the ceremony

42
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,440
enchanting this refugees

43
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,360
taking refugees is part of the ceremony

44
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,440
and for me when i did this

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,560
ceremony a long time ago

46
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,720
i i felt like a turning point in my life

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,040
i felt some deep sense of sense of

48
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,720
surrendering

49
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,080
into this dermal path

50
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,760
and so nowadays uh in many

51
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,440
dharma centers or retreat centers in

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,640
particular

53
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,040
i know in inside retreat center our

54
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,120
retreat center here

55
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,640
in scotts valley california

56
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,360
usually at the beginning of the retreat

57
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,239
and the group

58
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,000
would initiate the whole retreat process

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,440
by taking refugees in the buddha dharma

60
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,840
and sangha

61
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,400
together in monastic settings

62
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,760
and many lay buddhist communities

63
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,200
take refugees very often sometimes on

64
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,000
daily basis

65
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
so what does this really mean taking

66
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,319
refuge

67
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,400
in the buddha dharma and sangha

68
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,040
it's quite worth reflecting um

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,640
for me i was i was i feel like i'm

70
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,319
very fond of the chinese translation

71
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,000
of buddha gancia me this polychant

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,599
in particular on the chinese translation

73
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,880
of ganciami

74
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,000
is that of return and

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,199
rely and so under

76
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,320
a chinese version of

77
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,000
taking refuge is something like this

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,080
and to the to the buddha i return

79
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,919
and rely to the sun

80
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,800
to the dharma i return and rely

81
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,639
and to the sangha i return

82
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,520
and rely

83
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,759
i like the sense of returning a lot

84
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,360
and the chinese character used for

85
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,080
returning

86
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,360
it often relates to the sense of

87
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,880
returning home

88
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,880
or coming back you know sometimes when

89
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,000
someone has been staying oversea

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,120
in some other places when they go back

91
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,560
home and this is the character that's

92
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,840
being used

93
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,199
which is this returning so what does it

94
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,320
mean by returning to the buddha

95
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,680
coming home to the buddha this

96
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,840
orientation

97
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,280
the sense of returning and to me

98
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,120
is that it's not necessarily going out

99
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,080
to somewhere

100
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,800
out there but rather

101
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,639
it's just turning inward and coming back

102
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,199
right here somewhere within us

103
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,479
the home of this being with this life

104
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,160
and so in this way there's a sense of

105
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,080
i return and rely

106
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,600
um it's not appointing to

107
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,960
something of worshipping

108
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,240
something out there

109
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,199
rather something deeply inside of us

110
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,560
in the pali

111
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,720
recollection chance and often times in

112
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,240
the monasteries

113
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,520
there are this form of chantings that

114
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,039
monastics do on very regular basis

115
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,319
called the recollections there is a

116
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,880
particular chant around the recollection

117
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
of the triple gm

118
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,360
that is a one is to remember and be

119
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,280
reminded of

120
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,560
the qualities of the buddha dharma and

121
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,039
sangha

122
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,199
and the um the qualities of the buddha

123
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,319
in this recollection chant

124
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,520
um is that

125
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,599
the buddha is the one who is an arahant

126
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,960
who is completely free from

127
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,319
great hatred and delusion and

128
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,199
he's someone was rid of this kind of

129
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,479
forces completely

130
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,319
and totally incapable of great hatred

131
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,880
delusion

132
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,840
and another quality that's often being

133
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,120
remembered or recollected

134
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,199
is this um term called

135
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,479
charana sampano

136
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,240
that is one whose wisdom and compassion

137
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,840
are in perfect harmony

138
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,840
one is wise and compassionate

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,599
and the another quality and is that

140
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,000
the buddha is the one who trains those

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,120
who wish to be

142
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,319
trained like

143
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,440
us and wish to be trained

144
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,319
and buddha serves to teach those who

145
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,520
wish to be trained

146
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,479
so there's a sense of taking refuge in

147
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,000
the buddha

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,360
is like returning home to this kind of

149
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,399
qualities finding true

150
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,680
safety and security in this kind of

151
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,320
qualities

152
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,320
relying on non-greed non-hatred

153
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,040
a non-delusion to live our lives

154
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,080
instead of relying on i don't know

155
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,080
money status relationships

156
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,839
power you know many things

157
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,519
that um we may

158
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,240
rely on are actually quite unreliable

159
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,800
um in the dharma teachings

160
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
and it's really possible through the

161
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,320
practice and to cultivate this kind of

162
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,760
qualities

163
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,680
as if it's not that the buddha would not

164
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,040
have taught for over 45 years

165
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,399
and by wandering all around

166
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,839
in different parts of india

167
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,440
by foot

168
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,920
so personally the sense of taking refuge

169
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,560
in the buddha evokes the sense of

170
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,160
surrendering oneself

171
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,120
to this possibility to this possibility

172
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,720
to become free

173
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,080
from great hatred delusion and this

174
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,519
possibility to be wise

175
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,720
and compassionate the possibility of

176
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:18,240
serving oneself and serving others

177
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,519
and oftentimes through it's

178
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,959
through cultivation of

179
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,240
mindfulness concentration

180
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,279
ethical conducts

181
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,000
that this kind of quality began to

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,480
become

183
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,240
possible or accessible

184
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,079
within us and through the teachings of

185
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,120
the buddha

186
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,399
and this tools of mindfulness

187
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,399
the tools of cultivating concentration

188
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,079
the tools of of abiding sila

189
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,519
can allow us to

190
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,560
clean out the stuff that

191
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,399
hinders the access to this kind of

192
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,560
beautiful qualities

193
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,839
and this leads to maybe the the second

194
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,839
refuge which is a refuge in and the

195
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,079
dharma

196
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,680
returning and relying on the dharma

197
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,000
so what does this mean returning and

198
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,360
relying on the dharma

199
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,720
in the recollection of the triple gm

200
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,160
the dharma is said to be here

201
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,480
and now always present

202
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,279
timeless

203
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,839
inviting investigation

204
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,000
and dharma leads

205
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,079
is leading inward or leading towards

206
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,800
liberation

207
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,959
and dharma is to be individually

208
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,440
experienced

209
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,240
by the wise

210
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,040
and so you hear this kind of qualities

211
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,839
that describe the dharma

212
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,920
something that's right here and right

213
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,040
now

214
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,079
it's present right here it's not

215
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,639
found in you know long-winded memories

216
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,519
or fantasies in the future

217
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,600
but it's something that we can touch

218
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,760
into right here

219
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,200
maybe in the breath we breathe in

220
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,360
and breathe out and in the sensations of

221
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,760
the body

222
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,000
in the sand that's traveling through

223
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,519
something that's unfolding right here

224
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,040
right now

225
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,040
in front of us and it's said to

226
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,120
invite investigation

227
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,399
invites us to see pay careful attention

228
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,519
to this

229
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,800
quite a secret unfolding of our lives

230
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,440
right here

231
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,920
and it's by this form of quite

232
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,519
deeply intimate seeing

233
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,800
and clear seeing of

234
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,240
the phenomenon that's unfolding in front

235
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,639
of us

236
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,720
and liberating insights can arise

237
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,240
the insides into anicha dukkha

238
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,120
anata that is impermanence

239
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,000
stress and unsatisfactoriness

240
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,040
and not self

241
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,920
and this insights can really lead can

242
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,800
lead

243
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,959
to the freedom of grasping

244
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,120
lead from lead us into the freedom from

245
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,480
great hatred delusion

246
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,000
and so it's through this returning again

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,480
and again to the immediacy of

248
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,720
our lived experience

249
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,519
we can begin to see clearly what is

250
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,079
going on

251
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,519
as i was reflecting about

252
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,720
what we usually rely on

253
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,879
or return to

254
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,000
you know what we are when we i didn't

255
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,800
when i didn't

256
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,839
start practicing dharma

257
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,480
i there's lots of external things

258
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,160
that i'm thinking that i would depend on

259
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,360
or rely on that it would make me feel

260
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,399
okay i feel safe you know maybe the

261
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:56,880
weather

262
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,240
needs to be good or the neighborhood

263
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,079
needs to be nice and the shelter is

264
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,600
comfortable

265
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
and somehow one way or another family

266
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,240
members are in harmony

267
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,440
and our bodies are healthy enough

268
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,440
um or maybe you know no one is saying

269
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,480
think anything bad about you or no one

270
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,199
is looking down on you

271
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,839
maybe you have a good job lots of those

272
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,040
kind of things

273
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,240
and that one can put

274
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,680
a lot of efforts in

275
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,880
to try to get them all lined up so that

276
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,199
we can feel

277
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,279
a sense of okayness or feel a sense of

278
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,600
safety but after we try

279
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,680
for some years maybe many years

280
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,839
we begin to see it's pretty difficult

281
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,120
right so no matter what we do

282
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,399
somehow um maybe they're always someone

283
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,800
who's not particularly happy with

284
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,480
what you said what you did

285
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,839
things are not always coming together

286
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,839
harmoniously

287
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,000
so putting a lot of effort on trying to

288
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,959
sort out

289
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,839
all of this external uh

290
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:25,839
reliances

291
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,279
may not really work out

292
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,480
so this taking refuge in the dharma

293
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,880
is a calling for us to look in a

294
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,120
different way

295
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,000
not outside but deeply inside of us

296
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,120
and also something that happens here and

297
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,759
now

298
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,920
not in the past and not in the future

299
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,959
and i also say that um

300
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,558
when we when we follow the

301
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,760
buddha's teachings cultivating our mind

302
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,438
and heart

303
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,720
we don't do this alone

304
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,839
as i was reflecting on the vast

305
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,038
transmission the collection and the and

306
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,240
the translations of these teachings that

307
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,520
came from more than

308
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,880
2 600 years ago

309
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,679
countless individuals have walked to the

310
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,760
path

311
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,000
countless individuals have been

312
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,360
cultivating

313
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,400
their heart and mind in the past and

314
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,919
right now

315
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,240
just look at all of us here together

316
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,520
practicing together

317
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,440
and there will be this kind

318
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,960
of forces happening in the future too

319
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,080
in the way we are the direct

320
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,240
beneficiaries

321
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,520
of the stream and currents of the wisdom

322
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,440
and compassion

323
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,840
from so many people before us

324
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,840
i'm feeling that even in our virtual

325
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,760
meditation hall or dharma hall

326
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,440
a group of us are joining

327
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,640
the current of the practice the current

328
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,520
of the sangha

329
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,640
so here the community of the

330
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,760
practitioners

331
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,360
who practice well is the home to return

332
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,600
to

333
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,039
i'm fond of this particular suta where

334
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,160
ananda

335
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,600
said it to the buddha one time that

336
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,120
half of the holy life is a sangha

337
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,679
but the buddha corrected him and buddha

338
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,320
said

339
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,240
no no ananda don't say that

340
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,480
the whole of the holy life is sangha

341
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,559
because if the sangha practices the

342
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,799
noble eightfold path

343
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,559
you will do so as well

344
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,720
isn't that true and so if

345
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,360
all of you are practicing noble

346
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,919
eightfold path

347
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,080
i will be doing this no doubt

348
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,840
as part of the sangha

349
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,640
and so for me personally at some point

350
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,080
of my dharma journey

351
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,799
dharma practice journey i had a

352
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,039
realization that the dharmapath

353
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,280
can't be claimed as mine

354
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,559
because i'm constantly influenced

355
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,919
shaped inspired and moved

356
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,120
by people like you

357
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,440
by my teachers by the dharma bodies

358
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,440
by the sangha i'm part of

359
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,840
and when i'm returning to the home of

360
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,320
sangha there is no doubt

361
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,559
that these currents were drawing force

362
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,320
and the practice will unfold will move

363
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,799
each other

364
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,159
now i remember sometimes if i get caught

365
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,280
up in the things

366
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,840
of the world i don't know worldly wings

367
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,520
um but when i'm

368
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,200
entering into a group of practitioners

369
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,960
for a sit offer a dharma talk

370
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,240
or for an event together

371
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,000
often i have the sense of coming home

372
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,600
there is a real sense of safety here

373
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,760
i can trust the collective conscience

374
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,400
collective goodwill kindness

375
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,520
and the beautiful wholesome qualities

376
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,559
that the the sangha cultivates together

377
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,480
so this returning and relying

378
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,760
on the goodness of the sangha is a real

379
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,720
refuge

380
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,600
a real home

381
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,799
and so um i wanted to maybe

382
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,320
um just feeling this and

383
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,840
chanting retreat energy i wanted to

384
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,080
end today's talk maybe by chanting

385
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,039
for a few minutes on this particular

386
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,000
chant

387
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,080
that touched me quite deeply and this is

388
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,200
paying respect to the buddha dharma and

389
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,679
sangha

390
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,039
and the the chant is in poly

391
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,840
um and it's actually quite a simple

392
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,200
chant

393
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,320
and if you wish and definitely join me

394
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,640
and join me and it's a repeat so

395
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,440
hopefully as you follow along and a

396
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,799
couple of times

397
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,159
you'll be able to join in and on this

398
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,159
chant

399
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,690
in this chant it goes on like this

400
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:52,840
[Music]

401
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
means

402
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,320
reverence or to revere

403
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,760
and so what this chant is saying

404
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,120
is to revere

405
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,440
the buddha to revere the dharma

406
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,279
and to revere the sangha

407
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,440
and so i'm going to begin and

408
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,960
if you like to join me and after maybe

409
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,679

410
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,159
