1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,960
so hello everyone and Welcome to our

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:15,760
meditation and one of the maybe unusual aspects of Buddhist

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,080
spirituality is its emphasis on absence the absence of

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,599
things and with some reflection we can appreciate that how much happiness can

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,760
come from absence right now I'm sitting where it's

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,559
warm at IMC and the absence of the cold which is outside here it uh looks like

7
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:47,559
it might rain so it's absence of rain in this room I

8
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:55,359
feel uh safe from the cold and the wet outside it feels cozy and nice to have

9
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,680
to be here coming down to IMC this morning

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,880
there were beautiful sunrise in this slivers of empty space

11
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,080
where the clouds weren't on the horizon so it was delighted

12
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,840
by by with the beautiful colors and and colors were there partly what stood out

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,759
was the absence of clouds in those slivers that slices of the

14
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,960
sky so there can be the happiness of not having it to deal with any

15
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,200
responsibilities to sit in meditation and not have

16
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:46,399
to you know go to a meeting or do the chores or something just nice

17
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:53,320
the absence feels good absence as a condition for a sense

18
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,920
of contentment and happy happiness AB the absence of desires Happ

19
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,360
AB of conceit absence of hostility can feel so

20
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,760
good so wonderful absence is not something

21
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,000
that we're trained to focus on to look

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,640
for the mind's always usually interested in something if we're thinking about a lot

23
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,560
we're thinking about something absence absence of thought

24
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,720
ABS absence of a subject to be thinking

25
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:45,560
about can be so nice that peace so assuming a meditation

26
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,480
posture and closing the

27
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,000
eyes and taking a few moments to feel your

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,879
body maybe rock your body back and forth maybe side to

29
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:14,200
side as a way of connecting to your body feeling your

30
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:21,879
body loosening your body and then slowly come to Stillness

31
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:27,560
with the body and having moved the body a bit the

32
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:35,080
Stillness might be highlight the absence of

33
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,239
movement can highlight the sensations of the body

34
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:45,480
that's

35
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:56,840
still and then taking a few long slow deep

36
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,920
breaths release in tension in your body as you

37
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,120
exhale when I was first introduced as Zen I was taught to Flap my elbows like

38
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,000
a chicken it made me smile but also I learned that that could

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,560
kind of loosen things up in the arms so the arms AR somehow

40
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,040
unconsciously held tight

41
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,639
and

42
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,240
if and then letting the breathing return to

43
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:50,080
normal and as you exhale Relax The Thinking

44
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,759
mind relax the grip thinking has on whatever subject

45
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:08,599
of thought that concerns your

46
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:36,199
thinking and also now take a broad Global sense of you sitting

47
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:42,400
here feeling the body as broadly as you can easily

48
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,880
can and with this broad awareness of the body

49
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:56,360
appreciate the absence of business of

50
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:03,199
activity of running around being being in commute

51
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,160
traffic just appreciate some of the ways of being which are not

52
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,080
here and how it allows the body your very

53
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:32,319
being to have breathing room to have space to just

54
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,960
be and if you do feel safe in the place you're

55
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:53,400
meditating they appreciate the absence of danger we live in a world where many

56
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,759
people live in danger and they can have a deep sense of

57
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,879
well-being contentment at least for these few

58
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,400
minutes to be meditating in

59
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:30,800
safety and perhaps to the degree to which there's an absence of distractions

60
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:39,360
there can be a happiness to just being

61
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:47,720
here alive breathing attentive engaged in the

62
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,919
practice which has tremendous meaning and purpose tremendous

63
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:01,240
benefit what a good thing to have this practice

64
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:18,319
and with whatever Global feeling of well-being that's available to

65
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:27,440
you let that wellbeing be massaged or touched or

66
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,800
stroked by your body

67
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:48,040
breathing the expansion of the rib cage the

68
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,399
belly touches moves into whatever Global feeling of

69
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,399
well-being you have

70
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:07,880
and the exhales letting go with settling

71
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,000
in to the middle of this

72
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,399
well-being one breath at a

73
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
time

74
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320

for e

85
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,079
a means of contentment of

86
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,279
well-being is not to focus your thoughts on what's

87
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,920
wrong but to focus on what is absent

88
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,440
here what is absent that feels really good and

89
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,920
supportive that allows your muscles to relax your heart to

90
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,800
settle maybe even allows your heart to smile

91
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:35,160
so good to just be

92
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,720
here in the Simplicity of this

93
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:52,880
moment allowing a sense of well-being to

94
00:16:53,480 --> 00:17:00,839
support mindfulness

oh

108
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,600
and as we approach the end of the

109
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:20,320
sitting to see if you can feel whatever sense of

110
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:29,240
well-being there is in your body your mind your heart

111
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,520
if you're a little more calm or settled than when you started the

112
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,720
meditation if you're a little bit more still

113
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,919
quiet is there any

114
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:53,279
wellbe in that subtleness in that calm

115
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:12,799
even the slightest sense of well-being in being here and now in this

116
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,720
body in this mind in this heart at this

117
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,039
time let the influence of that

118
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:32,120
wellbe register for for you AB absorb it take

119
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,360
it

120
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:48,559
in like the warmth on a cold

121
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:59,279
day taking in the warmth of well-being

122
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,279
contentment happiness

123
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,119
and then [Music]

124
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,039
imagine that you meet someone who's friendly and

125
00:26:51,279 --> 00:27:00,240
kind and you meet them with your well-being

126
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,398
being you meet them with your

127
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:29,480
contentment how are you when you're calm and relaxed

128
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,799
at ease how are you in being with someone

129
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:42,559
who is undemanding who's also kind

130
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,760
relaxed might there be some good

131
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:59,120
will some friendliness that you have

132
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:08,000
and if you do maybe you can let your good will now spread out across the

133
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,159
lands let your good will spread to include all

134
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:20,760
beings may all beings be happy may all

135
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:29,000
beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

136
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:37,200
may all beings be free and may your

137
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:44,240
wellbeing contribute to the well-being of

138
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,960
others don't sacrifice your own well-being because then you have less

139
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:59,330
less to offer others [Music]

140
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,720
thank

141
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,039
you

142
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,039
e e

143
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:40,760
so hello everyone and welcome to this second talk on the no that maybe I shouldn't

144
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:46,039
call it Noble but the truths of four truths of

145
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:52,360
happiness and um the second Truth For Today is

146
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:58,320
um the truth of the conditions for happiness

147
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,320
and this is uh chosen carefully because uh rather than calling it the causes of

148
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:13,000
Happiness there are the conditions for happiness and just that is significant if we if there's cause for

149
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,600
happiness the chances are that happiness becomes too dependent on a cause too

150
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:26,519
dependent if something has to happen so that we can be happy and the happiness then becomes

151
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:34,720
fragile and chances are that that uh happiness is not very deep or is not

152
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:41,200
very pervasive it could be genuine to be caused by

153
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:48,159
something um and it can touch us wonderfully at times the um but it uh

154
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:55,159
it's it's not something which um Can persist very well except in memory when

155
00:31:55,159 --> 00:32:03,240
the cause is not there in Buddhism there's a lot of emphasis on understanding the conditions

156
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:10,720
for maturing in this Dharma maturing in the Buddhist path a path that comes with

157
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:17,240
it the arising of joy and happiness Delight gladness

158
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:24,399
contentment so a whole slew of uh feelings that belong to the family of

159
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:31,360
well-being and they're an integral part of developing this practice but it's there this these things are not

160
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,679
caused by anything but the conditions come in place for them to

161
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,559
arise and sometimes some of this when the conditions come into place um they

162
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:48,679
teach us something about the availability of happiness and

163
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:56,919
well-being that uh maybe is here much more often than we realize so because some of the the

164
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:05,080
conditions are absences so for example the absence of

165
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:14,360
uh being unethical the absence of killing and stealing and sexual misconduct and lying

166
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,880
intoxication this is phenomenal this is understood in Buddhism to be a source of

167
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:26,600
U just the feeling of safety a feeling of Happiness contentment a feeling of

168
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:33,039
relief and and um but it comes from an absence of doing these things absence of

169
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:38,639
causing harm and um and this is a condition for

170
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:43,760
something for sense of delight and happiness relief especially if you we

171
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:50,360
know the alternative uh some people's lives get ruined by being

172
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:56,200
unethical their lives become very stressful but to not have any of that

173
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:02,000
and uh and to have the freedom the fresh air in the heart uh can be a sense of

174
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,240
tremendous well-being of happiness and we learn about

175
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,480
that the absence of being unethical and we get a sense oh that

176
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,960
happiness isn't so way is always available it's not dependent on

177
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:24,320
something happening it's dependent on an absence of something so if we stay close

178
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:32,560
to that absence it's always available and and um and if we make that absence a thing

179
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:39,839
and that's going to cause us to be happy then we're already caught and that there has to be a certain way but the idea is

180
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,760
to just trust the conditions the absence of stress in our

181
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:52,358
lives there can be a sense of well-being that teaches us the same thing that there is a sense of well-being

182
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:58,640
contentment ease that's possible when we don't have stress so why get

183
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:05,839
stressed that's the kind of the big question that as a really I think a mature DH practitioner would ask

184
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:12,880
themselves why get stressed why get stressed when maybe the alternative is so much

185
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:19,440
better and um and then see what kind of answers you come and maybe have a discussion with yourself or with friends

186
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:27,880
or people about this whole question why do you allow yourself to get stressed why is it so important question it the

187
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:34,839
absence of stress can provide well-being sense of ease a lot of goodness that

188
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:40,920
that can grow and develop it Fosters room in the heart for something to

189
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:48,160
come so um the absence of the hindrances the absence of greed hate and delusion

190
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,760
the absence of anxiety these can all provide a sense of relief a sense of

191
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:02,240
ease a sense of Harmony a sense that things are good in the world and at least locally here and now and we're

192
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,920
allowed to feel the goodness of that don't sacrifice that goodness for

193
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:15,040
anything if you think the conditions in the world political world the whatever is happening in the climate and the

194
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:21,400
environment um if you give away your inner goodness give away abandon

195
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:28,240
yourself to the anxiety to the anger to the dismay to the confusion

196
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:35,400
that those things give rise to that's tragic the uh because it's from the very

197
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:41,359
sense of inner well-being ease goodness that uh that something

198
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:47,480
profound can happen even if you're going to be involved in any of those causes

199
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,599
can you do it from that place of your own goodness your own well-being that

200
00:36:52,599 --> 00:37:00,000
comes from the absence of giving yourself away the absence of hostility the absence of greed the absence of

201
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,240
anxiety so there's a tremendous the condition for happiness that can develop

202
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:11,720
and grow is has a lot to do with the an absence rather than a

203
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:18,319
cause and an absence then allows something to grow and part of this field

204
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:23,560
of goodness field of well-being when there's space for it is the growth of

205
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:31,000
wholesome qualities wholesome States within us um um that we have natural

206
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,440
capacities uh for some things and maybe different for different people but we

207
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,640
have some some people have a natural capacity to care beautiful caregiving

208
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:49,200
care for the welfare well-being of others some people have a natural capacity for generosity for kindness

209
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:57,640
friendliness compassion love some people have a natural capacity for um for for

210
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:04,000
calm and uh honesty and integrity we all have some of this

211
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,640
perhaps and as we have these absences that preoccupy us because breaking the

212
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:17,880
precepts being unethical a pre requires some kind of preoccupation uh being caught in things

213
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:25,560
that are stressful and what means we're somehow preoccupied being caught in anger and hostility dismay and anxiety

214
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:32,800
we're preoccupied to be unoccupied or to occupy ourselves in a

215
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,480
deep way not be preoccupied gives room for wholesome qualities to

216
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:45,599
grow and these are invaluable in the Dharma and these wholesome qualities if

217
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:53,960
we act on them like we act from generosity if we act with care or love or kindness or friendliness they have

218
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,319
space in in The Emptiness of G create hate and delusion The Emptiness of

219
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:06,560
stress to evoke or fuel or strengthen an inner sense of Happiness

220
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:14,720
well-being and so part of what we do in Buddhism is both an absence appreciating absences that bring us a better sense of

221
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,839
well-being and also we appreciate that certain things when they're acted on are

222
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:28,079
the further conditions for well-being not that generosity is seen as a cause for happiness but the gener

223
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,680
uh uh sensibility Fosters the growth of more

224
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:41,400
well-being ethical Integrity Fosters the growth of well-being and so we're more gardeners

225
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:48,640
than we are cont Engineers we're not engineering ourselves into happiness in Buddhism but

226
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,599
we're planting the seeds we're tending the field we're tending the garden the plants we're nourishing them feeding

227
00:39:54,599 --> 00:40:00,240
them watering them uh keeping the we weeds out of the garden so they can grow

228
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,599
well and so we have inside of ourselves uh

229
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:11,839
weeds and we going to be very careful with them that they don't um suffocate

230
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:18,480
or or shade out uh the good plants that are growing

231
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:25,119
in there appreciate the absence of weeds appreciate the clarity the breathing

232
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:32,520
room that provides and then appreciate that there is goodness in us there is wholesome qualities within us don't

233
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:40,920
sacrifice those don't abandon them because then you abandon yourself in some ways the Instinct towards hostility

234
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:46,000
aversion the Instinct towards desire the Instinct towards

235
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,319
conceit are oddly enough ways in which we give ourselves away we lose ourselves

236
00:40:52,319 --> 00:41:00,480
in those because we're limiting ourselves to particular concern we're defining ourselves a very narrow uh uh

237
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,920
range of what it means to be a human being and so to give ourselves away that

238
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:12,280
way is quite sad don't give yourself away stay

239
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:17,359
present in the absence stay present in the goodness

240
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:22,680
stay present for the whole the breathing room where there's fresh air for your

241
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,800
heart for your body because it's in that Breathing Room things where we're all

242
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:34,319
there for ourselves that we don't limit ourselves with preoccupations where there's a condition

243
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:41,599
for the arising of Happiness so if you want to be

244
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,920
happy contribute the conditions for that don't search for a

245
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:53,680
cause if you think you're going to be happy by going to Disneyland you might

246
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,240
be but that's not going to create lasting happiness

247
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,520
unless you go to Disneyland in this empty

248
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:11,800
open place with your own goodness flowing out of

249
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,880
it and then if that's the case maybe you don't need to go to

250
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,119
Disneyland because the core happiness is not dependent on Disneyland the core

251
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:27,280
happiness is already in you and you can do anything you could even go to the

252
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,839
local soup kitchen to support people who are hungry and you maybe feel even

253
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:40,559
happier than you would if you went to Disneyland so

254
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:47,079
conditions the second truth of happiness is that a pro profound meaningful

255
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:53,599
happiness dhic happiness arises from the conditions that are we put in place not

256
00:42:53,599 --> 00:43:01,040
the causes so thank you and um

257
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,480
May you look for the conditions

258
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,640
today not in the world per se but in

259
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:17,680
yourself that you can stay close to so you go through the day

260
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,960
happier and perhaps you can put a rubber band or a string around one of your

261
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:30,599
fingers or something as a reminder that through the day you keep looking for how you can create

262
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:34,520
the inner conditions

263
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:44,520
absences that you or that you touch into a natural sense of well-being ease

264
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:53,318
happiness that comes when you don't give yourself away thank you
