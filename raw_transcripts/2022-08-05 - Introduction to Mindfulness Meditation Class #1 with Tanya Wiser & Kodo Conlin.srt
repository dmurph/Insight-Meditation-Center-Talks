1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,439
wanting they want to respond any thoughts that you'd be willing to share you need more time to think or

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,800
great

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:24,640

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,960
long time watching you know gill for maybe three or four years and haven't made it yet

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,520
okay i usually watch the second half of his lecture and kind of don't do the meditation in the first half

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,440
and i've done a lot of meditating but it's something called intuitive medicine where you do like chakras and clearing

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,000
and grounding and symbols and all this active meditation stuff okay i just kind of wanted to

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,440
just enjoying gil for so long see the other side of just a real still quiet buddhist oriented meditation and

31
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,239
through imc um just listening to the audio dharma i'm not quite blanking on that name

32
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,920
of what it was but yeah well if it was through here it was vipassana okay yeah that's probably everything yes

34
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,080
thank you hi i'm linda hi linda i'm here at the invitation of my daughter i was

35
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,080
here once before um i actually used to meditate um daily

36
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,920
and then for some reason when i moved to a different apartment i just got out of the habit of doing it

37
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:55,360
interestingly enough i didn't do it at all during the pandemic which i probably should have anyway when

38
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,480
she invited me to come i decided it was the nudge that i need to get back to doing a practice beautiful here i am

39
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,680
thank you and did you do this kind of vipassana meditation in the past i did it

40
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,599
with deepak chopra on on a video great yeah perfect great okay anyone else

41
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,199
i'll just say great i can go hi i'm carlin linda's daughter hi carlin

42
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,960
and i have really picked up mindfulness meditation

43
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,600
over the course of the pandemic moving forward i honestly started with an app

44
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,639
on my phone and started a practice in the mornings as i was working to help

45
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:45,520
with the stress related to the pandemic and this past january i had the pleasure of

46
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,320
going down to baja and doing a retreat a seven day retreat where we did a mindfulness practice

47
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,000
every morning with a gentleman who told me about imc

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,320
and and so i had uh just a wonderful experience there and then came came back here and wanted to start

49
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,440
to incorporate more into my practice and it's taken me a while to actually get here but um was able to do a session with with

50
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:19,039
gil or a sit with gil a couple weeks ago and heard about this intro and great was happy to to come and learn more great

51
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,440
beautiful and then richard can you just check the youtube chat to see if anyone on youtube has a particular

52
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,400
reason they're here that that you could read out loud for us

53
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,759
okay okay great all right so

54
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,639
any other kind of different reason for being here

55
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,960
and maybe there'll be more time for those questions and answers or things to be brought up so

56
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:56,160
i guess i should kind of shift into orienting and starting i'm tanya weiser

57
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:03,039
i'm happy to be here really grateful for your presence it feels pretty a significant shift actually for

58
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:10,960
imc to be opening back up and starting to offer the intro class again and

59
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,440
and i'm really really excited to be a part of that and hoping to support

60
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,199
more of it and more community um and uh

61
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,960
just a heads up too that there's a couple other follow-ups we'll be offering um

62
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,639
a day long for intro will happen in september on the 10th and then

63
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,520
there'll be a second series following this one about establishing your practice so we'll we'll just sort of keep building

64
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:49,919
and see where we go but i'm glad you're here and um hope that it supports you right um

65
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:56,560
making it real i think you know the connection real the song gorilla and

66
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,560
so i want to just say a couple words about imc insight meditation center so

67
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,759
you know this is a buddhist center in vapasana tradition

68
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:18,479
and within the kind of origins of vipassana all teachings are offered by donna

69
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:25,199
meaning generosity so this whole center because of our founding teacher gil franztal is

70
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,759
completely devoted to everything being offered freely

71
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:39,039
so there is not a single employee of insight meditation center no one gets paid to do anything here

72
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,720
and at you the community has paid for and pays for everything

73
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,160
all the costs of insight meditation center so it's completely because of people's

74
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:57,120
generosity and time and love and finances that we exist

75
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,840
you're a part of it if you want to be a part of it there's no membership other than that so

76
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,639
i think it's pretty profound i actually just feel a sense of shivers in myself because it to me it is such a profound

77
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:18,000
thing to be a part of and to offer so i invite you to be comfortable

78
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,639
there are restrooms there are cushions there's kodo is going to talk about sitting

79
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:33,360
posture and you can use the equipment here so please make yourself comfortable

80
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,680
and i hope you feel welcome totally welcome

81
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,279
included part of so

82
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,720
um yeah maybe

83
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,200
maybe now koto you could say a few words about just introducing yourself and yeah

84
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,880
yeah sure thank you tanya can everyone hear me okay if you need as we go along there are

85
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,880
hearing assisted devices just around the corner if that's useful for you um

86
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,200
yeah my name is kodo coto conlon i live in san francisco so i i travel

87
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,320
down here to be with all of you i take a lot of joy and insight meditation fibasana practice

88
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,399
this tradition i've been practicing meditation for about 20 years

89
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,480
and that has added up to a lot of hours a lot of wrong turns which turned out to

90
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,920
be right turns i hope we all have such good fortune

91
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,200
i think the thing i want to communicate at the beginning just to echo something tanya just said

92
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,279
is yeah inviting you to be comfortable in the space whatever that whatever that takes for you

93
00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:00,320
um finding your way being comfortable in the body while we're here together because i think that supports

94
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,560
us being together in community and i think uh one of the one of the benefits to all of us being here

95
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,160
together and being here online is that we have other people we're going through this course with

96
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,839
and uh connecting starting starting to make those relationships as we want to

97
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,200
so i think that's all for me great so i'll just say a couple more

98
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,640
words and then koto will do posture um

99
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,959
so you're here to learn mindfulness practice

100
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,200
mindfulness meditation so it is from buddhism

101
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,200
buddhism cannot exist without mindfulness but mindfulness can exist without

102
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:55,040
buddhism so there's no requirement for you to be a buddhist to be here or to practice

103
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,640
you can have any other spiritual or non-spiritual beliefs and practice

104
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,480
mindfulness okay so permission you don't need to agree

105
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,839
with it you know any philosophy or approach it's about a

106
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,760
practice and it's a direct practice it's a practice that supports us in

107
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,560
connecting right and connecting with our inner experience with more depth

108
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:31,120
and our outer experience with more ease connection depth ease

109
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,800
and the practice helps us gain choice

110
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:44,880
and reduce our reactivity so the invitation as much as possible is

111
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,760
to be comfortable to allow to know what's happening as it's happening

112
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:58,160
so this is why we're emphasizing you know this idea of it's okay to be in

113
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,600
your body it's okay to sit however you need to sit it's okay for whatever thoughts and

114
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,240
feelings to come up and we're practicing being with in a connected and non-reactive way to our

115
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,079
experience so that's what will grow it's kind of the big thing will grow

116
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:24,959
all right coda you want to guide us on sitting posture it might be helpful if i use the earlier

117
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,760
switch big invitation as we go along discovering uh the

118
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:46,880
posture for the next 10 minutes if you need more supplies you probably saw them on the way in we have cushions

119
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,200
blocks benches right around the end of the what was probably a stage here

120
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,279
and of course cheers so as i'm talking if you if you discover something that will support you in uh

121
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:05,120
finding the posture to help you stay alert and comfortable

122
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,279
for a stretch of 20 minutes 30 minutes then yep please get up and feel free to get

123
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:20,240
the supplies so a basic definition of mindfulness

124
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,680
to start with is a clear stable

125
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,360
non-judgmental awareness that's attentive

126
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,040
attentive to what's happening now clear and stable

127
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,360
not entangled at all and there's something actually that we're going to we're going to express

128
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:50,560
that with our bodies we're going to express clarity stability and balance

129
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,800
a couple of different ways we can go about the finding the basic postures i'm going to talk about sitting on the floor

130
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:04,000
sitting in a chair and i'll even i'll mention lying down practice which i i did for about a year

131
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,880
so maybe let's say something about uh the sitting on the floor first since

132
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,600
i'm here so have what she needs

133
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,880
great great um well there are certainly some some

134
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,000
benefits to sitting on the floor and then it lowers your center of gravity and can give you a wide base

135
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,199
i want to say before i begin talking about sitting on the floor perfectly

136
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,040
perfectly wonderful to sit in a chair for meditation i love that the the images the mythology

137
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:47,680
of the future buddha he's sitting in a chair so you're in you're in good company if you're if you set meditation in a chair

138
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,920
so regarding regarding all postures the most important thing

139
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,760
is an alert spine an upright spine that's both

140
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,399
energetic and allows the body to relax there's really something about

141
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:12,720
having a having a spine that's balanced on itself in such a way that the body is alert

142
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,959
that all the the muscles can start to balance and let go and release

143
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,720
so some particular pointers i'll be brief with the the time that we have

144
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,399
sitting on the floor everything starts with the base everything needs a foundation for your

145
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,839
spine to be upright and alert we have something like a tripod down here

146
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,440
but uh one point is the the sit bones on the cushion if you're on if you're on a

147
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,639
cushion sitting on the front third can be helpful to get the spine to align the in a comfortable way

148
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:56,160
there there are any number of cross-legged postures but uh a balanced one we recommend is

149
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:03,600
one leg in front of the other called taylor fashion or burmese fashion uh this can this is this both helps to

150
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,720
be symmetrical and also doesn't put too much torque on the knees or on the hips

151
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,800
and i invite you as we go through to feel free to play around with these different postures as we go through the five weeks like really spend some time

152
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,680
finding what works for you something i'll say if the hips and the knees are really tight

153
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,959
in order to help lower the knees it can be helpful to raise the hips so sometimes i'll sit on two cushions

154
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:37,079
and it raises this situation or

155
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:46,959
sometimes a knee doesn't want to come down but we need the we need the weight of the leg transferring to the floor so

156
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:54,720
put something underneath if you're going to support if you're going to support a knee

157
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:02,560
something to exp something to experiment with or something to make note of is that you you want to try to have the

158
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:09,280
the hips above the knees if the uh if the knees are above the hips it makes the back of the

159
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,760
the low back sort of turn out i love seeing everyone moving moving around and trying this out so yeah

160
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,160
please feel free

161
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,840
i'm going to show you another posture and then we'll move up from there so

162
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,760
great you're welcome to grab these two yeah

163
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,360
great crepe

164
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,799
so

165
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,600
i appreciate that so much so

166
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,640
finding a finding a a way for your lower body to be arranged such that

167
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,480
the spine can be upright and alert

168
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,840
it may be cross-legged let me show you another base posture before i sort of build the rest of the posture up and

169
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,160
that is you may sit kneeling like so where you turn

170
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,440
one of these cushions up like a wheel and sit like sit like this

171
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,279
that may be that may be more balanced

172
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,400
experiment please do yeah this will take some time

173
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,000
so finding finding the base finding the base that supports the spine to be upright

174
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,360
the shoulders can roll back

175
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,120
the hands we say can do can do anything where they're symmetrical a lot of people will

176
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:17,120
do palms down on the thighs palms up is fine

177
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,600
very traditionally we'll have one palm one hand on top of the other with the thumb tips and fetch in front

178
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,919
of the low belly whatever works for you something you want to look out for when

179
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,160
placing the hands is to to not place them in such a way that your shoulders get pulled forward

180
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,679
trying to maintain that front back balance is really important otherwise a real strain a real strain comes to the

181
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,760
back so this can help with that

182
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:55,329
resting your hand on a pillow nice [Music]

183
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:04,240
so from here one way you can really get into an upright position is once your base is settled you can sort of lift

184
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,120
yourself off the seat and let your spine grow nice and long

185
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,720
and then lower back down and doesn't your spine feel just a little bit longer

186
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,000
straighter the chin we say is just barely tucked

187
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,480
another way to think about this is putting some space in the the the last vertebrae under the skull so

188
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,679
the chin is tucking just like this to give some space up here

189
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,840
in this tradition we sit with the eyes closed if you're comfortable if you've trained in another way with eyes open

190
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,000
that's fine too mouth is closed um

191
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,360
i like to say relax the tongue i keep it uh keep it at the

192
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,360
uh the contact with the pallet the top but soft soft

193
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:02,200
i find if there's tension in the mouth there's all this tension in the face and the neck that can develop

194
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:12,480
one thing to check as you're establishing the posture is does your head feel balanced

195
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,320
like feel around is your head square on your shoulders or the ears line are the ears lined up

196
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,760
with the shoulders in such a way that your your back muscles can relax

197
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:32,240
wonderful so a thought or two about sitting in a chair

198
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,360
oh sure yeah yeah go ahead

199
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:52,080
how important is it to sit without back support oh that's fabulous thank you for the question

200
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,280
um i can say it's it can be really helpful

201
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,520
to sit without back support in the sense that it helps support the the attitude

202
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,360
of uh independence self-reliance

203
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,400
i it may be good to know that i uh i sit with a back injury

204
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,480
so very often can i have your support cushion very often i'll need a little something

205
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,799
in my at my low back so on a chair still try to keep try to

206
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:32,320
keep the feet flat on the floor if you can have your knees a little lower than your hips or right at the

207
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,960
same level but sometimes i'll tuck just a little support back here it really helps the really helps the low

208
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,120
back i try to minimize how much i lean lean on this so if i if my back feels

209
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:51,600
healthy and i don't need the support i'll actually sit on the edge of the chair

210
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,400
or something like this that feels really comfortable if you need back support all the way up

211
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,440
which sometimes sometimes that's necessary you can roll up a towel or

212
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,520
put one of these in half and put it along the spine such that the shoulder blades can still

213
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,720
relax back so i hope that responds to the question

214
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,799
on youtube

215
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:37,400
so those are some of the basics of posture the upright alert spine

216
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:45,039
having the sitting base established hands not pulling the shoulders forward

217
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:52,080
everything sort of aligned and opened love this hillary hillary's helping with

218
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,679
a posture clinic of sorts if at any point as we go along or in any of the breaks if you have questions about your

219
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,480
posture we can we can certainly address them it's really well worth investing in the time

220
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:11,840
to determine the posture that works for you it can make all the difference in uh establishing a practice in a a

221
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:19,279
more useful way yeah so i think with that go back to tanya for a while

222
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,480
you feel comfortable right now where you're at in your postures

223
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:37,200
okay and uh i think i'll just say one more thing about posture which is um

224
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,840
you know it's it's okay to be a little bit uncomfortable

225
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,120
and it's important to respect your body right

226
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,159
so if you're if you have an injury or if

227
00:24:54,159 --> 00:25:01,840
you're afraid you're starting to hurt yourself just take a breath recognize it's important to move

228
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,000
and move with consciousness with awareness to change your posture

229
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,720
don't make yourself stay because you're not supposed to move

230
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,919
meditation we're teaching and in this environment it's like a gym right to grow and

231
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:26,480
strengthen our mind and our mindfulness but we want to do this in all of our lives really to be more aware

232
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:33,360
so it's not that we have to not move we don't want to hurt ourselves it is possible to cause injuries to ourselves

233
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,200
if we overdo it in a posture so nerve damage can happen

234
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,360
it's not common but i've known people who've had it happen so it's important to

235
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,279
to not feel like you have to you know sit through pain a lot of pain okay

236
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,880
we'll talk later maybe when we do the body about working with pain

237
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,278
to support people who do have injuries or just physical pain

238
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,279
so now i want to shift and talk a little bit about how to prepare the mind

239
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,480
because we're preparing our bodies which is also supporting and preparing

240
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,080
our mind but when we come to practice when we come to practice meditation

241
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,760
it is helpful to do things to orient the mind to prepare the mind

242
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,679
before you actually begin to formally sit so some of the things that i'm thinking

243
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,120
of naming you know for you tonight is just

244
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:46,080
number one please give yourself permission to have any and every experience you

245
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,600
have tonight so whatever thought comes up whatever

246
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,799
mood whatever feeling please give yourself permission

247
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,919
to to know it right to have it that

248
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,639
it's not about sitting down to try and create an experience

249
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,600
it's about learning how to show up for the experiences happening does that make

250
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:21,279
sense so i asked earlier about kind of expectations or why you were here

251
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:27,919
and so just take a moment and just maybe reflect a little more deeply

252
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,799
and you know a lot of times people start to practice because they're suffering

253
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,320
so maybe one of the reasons you're here is that you don't want to be so anxious or you

254
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,919
don't want to be so depressed or because you don't want to say stupid things

255
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:52,559
anymore or you know you or maybe you want to be free you maybe have a deep aspiration

256
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:59,039
for freedom so those things are all really important

257
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:05,200
um they can support your practice held in the right way

258
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,640
no but no mud no buddha right no suffering no freedom

259
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,880
you know we we can use all of our experiences to help support our awakening

260
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:23,760
and if we sit down with an agenda we will suffer more right if we're trying to make

261
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,200
ourselves be different have a different experience

262
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,080
we're not going to find much peace so

263
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,279
our our minds works in a way that

264
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:54,399
it weaves together all of our different sense experiences that are happening in the moment coupled

265
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:01,679
with our memories from the past and the learnings that we have and our beliefs and perceptions all of the stuff

266
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,559
in our mind is a weaver and it weaves it all together

267
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,480
so much so that you know if we uh are often going along we don't we don't

268
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:19,279
we're not even aware of all the separate pieces and things that are that are feeding the experience

269
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:25,039
we're having we might not even know that part of the experience that we're

270
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:30,720
having is actually based on past or expectation instead of what's really happening in the moment

271
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,559
we may not even know that so one of the ways that we go about learning

272
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,679
to practice mindfulness is that we break apart

273
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:48,720
parts of our experience so the first and we start to learn more about each

274
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,159
part we get intimate with it so that we become much more familiar

275
00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:00,080
with how that flows in us how that shows up for us how it influences us

276
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,760
and over time we become increasingly attuned to these different aspects of

277
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:12,000
our experience this week the first week we start with mindfulness of breathing

278
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,039
as our primary kind of investigation

279
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:23,120
next week it will be body and so the work you do between now and

280
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,320
next week will be on breath and that work will lead and support

281
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:35,760
working on body awareness and then the third week we'll start to focus on emotions

282
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,760
so the breath and body will support your ability to be more mindful of emotions

283
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,039
fourth week will be the mind for thoughts

284
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,799
and again we're we're building we're building and we're also helping ourselves

285
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:59,519
get intimate with each aspect they're all interrelated i don't mean that they're not interconnected

286
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:06,799
but we can attune more finely to each one independent from the others

287
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:14,080
so tonight this week it's going to be about the breath

288
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:21,200
this thing that our bodies know how to do the first thing that we did

289
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,519
when we were born and the last thing that we'll do

290
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:35,039
on this life is to exhale in this world it's our longest companion

291
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,480
and it's a changing experience and it's much easier

292
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:47,679
for the mind to tune into something that's variable than to try and

293
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,279
pay attention to something that's unchanging relatively unchanging

294
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,799
so when um when you're doing certain kinds of uh

295
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:05,919
there's something called emdr a kind of therapy and you're stimulating the bilaterally

296
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,840
the brain if you have this stimulation it might be a tap

297
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,200
tap tap if it goes tap tap tap tap tap

298
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,279
same speed doesn't take very long for the brain to absolutely ignore it

299
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:28,320
it stops being input because it's no longer

300
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:35,679
causing the mind to pay attention to it because it's been figured out and it doesn't need to be attended to

301
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,799
so i say this to emphasize how important it is

302
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:47,840
to be tuning in to something that has some degree of flow and change in it that that's part of what helps

303
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:55,360
our minds stay connected just because of how we're wired

304
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,799
just because of how we're wired

305
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:08,720
so i just want to we're going to sort of glide into a meditation here as i'm

306
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:15,679
offering these instructions you might notice i'm slowing down am i talking

307
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,960
invitation is to sort of let things come to more of a stillness

308
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,720
so finding your body maybe acknowledging okay here i am we're

309
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:36,399
at imc oh whoa fast forward we actually have gone through the posture introduction we're gonna meditate

310
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:42,240
okay a couple of deep breaths can be a nice

311
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,760
support nice reset for the start of a meditation

312
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,120
feeling the support of your feet if they're on the floor your bottom if it's

313
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,760
on a chair

314
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,480
and if it's comfortable you might try shutting your eyes and if

315
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,480
it's not no problem you can gaze

316
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,800
typically we say a few feet in front of you on the floor or it's some sort of

317
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:31,040
blank bland object so your eyes can just sort of gaze there

318
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,639
so just taking a second to see what you can notice here

319
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,760
as you just receive your experience

320
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,440
maybe making the breath the star of the show

321
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:02,359
a little spotlight of awareness on the experience of breathing

322
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,520
noticing if it's long or short

323
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,920
fast or slow

324
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,680
just being curious curious about the experience of breath

325
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:02,599
noticing if there's a difference between the inhale and the exhale

326
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:41,838
and we can feel the breath in the body in a lot of different places

327
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,760
maybe noticing first how you experience breathing in your

328
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,760
nose

329
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,839
noticing perhaps in the throat

330
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,880
the chest

331
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,599
and the belly

332
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:24,078
receiving the language of the body which is sensations

333
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:31,799
receiving the massage of the breath as it comes in and goes out

334
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:16,920
and then just seeing where you are most aware of the breathing where it's most natural for you to feel the breath

335
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,400
and wherever it's easiest just sort of resting in that space

336
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,838
maybe relaxing a little bit more

337
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,800
you might think about yourself as a naturalist

338
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,960
somebody who's very committed to non-harming and

339
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:12,960
observing nature not there to make anything happen or

340
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,640
change anything but to be a beautiful witness

341
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:25,838
to take in the beauty of the nature the life

342
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:33,920
with this reverence with this sense of respecting

343
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:43,119
the life which is what we experience with breath life

344
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,240
so with the mind and the heart of a naturalist

345
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:58,240
just being attuned to breathing as it's occurring

346
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:07,319
in this body in this moment in this place

347
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,800
and how this breath is

348
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,640
and the next breath

349
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:26,319
and when because it will be a win when the mind

350
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:32,400
maybe catches you and carries you downstream in a thought

351
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,400
there's a precious moment when we recognize that's happening

352
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:48,480
when awareness is aware of thinking

353
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:57,000
we don't need to go anywhere we don't need to change anything or try and chase the thought away

354
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,480
see if you can't breathe with it

355
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:12,000
breathe through it and in time maybe the breath will become

356
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:20,280
in the center spotlight again being patient and kind

357
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,920
breathing just breathing

358
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,119
breathing with

359
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,680
and if it's hard to stay with a breath

360
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:50,519
it can be helpful to think about maybe a three-breath journey

361
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:58,560
just seeing if you can stay connected to three breaths in a row

362
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:04,560
feeling the beginning of the breath the ending the in-between

363
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:10,318
the new breath riding it like you might ride a surfboard on a wave

364
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,119
just three breaths little journey

365
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:11,839
and we're coming to the end of our practice not leaving it but but coming to the end

366
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:20,400
i invite you just to see how you can gently

367
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:27,079
feel intimately your next few breaths

368
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,319
i'm just resting as you hear the bell no need to quickly change

369
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:07,839
allowing yourself a slow and slow re-including of other

370
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,839
experience

371
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:38,800
just just noticing if anything has changed

372
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,839
just tuning in to feel of the vibration level the

373
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:52,079
energy the mind the heart what what feel what do you notice

374
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,920
is it different are you more connected are you uncomfortable and need to move

375
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:04,079
your body please feel free to take care of yourselves and we're going to shift into

376
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:10,000
a mining and question and answer looking for

377
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,520
the invitation to share a little bit about your experience what you noticed and

378
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,880
as you do it's an act of generosity to share it helps others

379
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:28,960
find and feel into their own experience so please take a little stretch

380
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:34,760
yeah maybe i'll take a drink of water

381
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:57,920
okay so we do have the microphones it is very

382
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,599
very helpful if you'll use them these talks are recorded and we are on

383
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:09,839
youtube right now so it's uh for the benefit of others that are listening that we speak into

384
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:17,440
the microphones and um yeah first maybe

385
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:23,119
what did you notice you were a little naturalist

386
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:29,040
in the wilderness of breathing what can you tell us about your

387
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:37,119
observations there's a microphone right

388
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,720
there thank you so much

389
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,200
my name is isabelo campo and

390
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:03,680
i for for a long time my life i've been trying to find a practice

391
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:09,520
and i did find myself meditating some years ago but then

392
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:16,240
i just move on into different things and things are fine in my life

393
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:24,240
but um again i've been questioning myself every day of

394
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:30,160
what am i doing is this ad is there more to my life

395
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:35,920
and i'm very grateful that i'm here today

396
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:42,160
and for a long after so long i was able to

397
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:50,880
just be just breathe and i did notice that

398
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:59,040
i had the need to take this really deep profound breath

399
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:06,660
and it was like coming from my heart it was i feel relief

400
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:13,280
[Music] this is my experience beautiful

401
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,760
anybody else thank you anyone wants to share

402
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,160
just

403
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:33,680
um i noticed how active my mind was beautiful nancy

404
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:39,200
and then after a while it was kind of like the the rhythm of the breath was

405
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:47,440
primary but the mind was still you know active more in the background

406
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,800
so i didn't necessarily feel

407
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:58,559
i don't know calm necessarily in the moment but after

408
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:04,720
the bell rang i noticed that i felt really calm i guess like i felt

409
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:09,920
my body was so still and i didn't realize that it happened

410
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:16,400
during the meditation so that was nice so great that you were able to

411
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,839
stay long enough right to feel that to notice that

412
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:28,960
yeah there was a share from someone online

413
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:36,480
that said sometimes i feel paralyzed at the end of the meditation is this normal

414
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,640
thank you for the question uh without being able to have a back and forth it's hard to know just what you

415
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:49,920
mean just just what the specifics are of what you mean by the word paralyzed

416
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:56,800
but to say something um you know paralyzed can have connotations

417
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:02,559
of fear also have a feeling of actually

418
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:07,920
physically not being able to move which may last for some time and

419
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,440
i wonder how long it lasts if i could talk to you that's one of the things i would ask

420
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,559
and what do you notice what do you notice about that transition

421
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,240
paralyzed can also have this other connotation which we just heard from nancy which is stillness

422
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,280
which may actually be something really wholesome so it's it's hard to parse without the

423
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,640
without a little bit of conversation um

424
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:42,000
i would say i would suspect that uh there's a there's a gradual coming back into sort of full contact with the body

425
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,119
that's that's happening and uh it's perfectly perfectly normal for

426
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:52,880
some of the machinery to start to power down while we meditate

427
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,880
and then it's good to be in touch or in contact with a teacher or an experienced meditator who can

428
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:05,200
help just gently gently keep you safely on the path that's what i would say to that

429
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:12,480
thank you um

430
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:18,960
i am going through some airway issues and breathing issues so it's been interesting um

431
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:26,240
it's extremely hard for me to do it which is a little bit upsetting but

432
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:33,920
you know want to keep trying yeah and so um and some people have

433
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:39,200
you know paying attention to breathing is triggering so you know that's where we'll

434
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:44,559
be talking about the body and so this week if it's just too much to do the breathing

435
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:52,000
just just tune into your body and we'll talk more about that next week but sensations move too right there's

436
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,240
there's ways to find that like the breath right because it's moving is a good object but you can pay

437
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:03,520
attention to the sense of sitting to feeling the sensations in your body

438
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,520
yeah

439
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:26,720
hello thank you der sanga my name is holly um

440
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:31,760
okay so when i first started my practice 11 years ago

441
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:37,520
i was so restless i couldn't focus on the breath i couldn't do mindfulness of the

442
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:42,799
breath so i had to learn love and kindness meditation

443
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:48,720
and samadhi with like visual objects i think they're called like nemitas or

444
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:54,640
something like colors or a candle flame or so i haven't even

445
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:01,280
bothered with mindfulness of the breath until today and now that i've calmed myself through

446
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,880
so much samadhi and loving-kindness [Music] i've finally

447
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,960
experienced the richness of the breath meditation but that's also to say that you don't

448
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:18,079
have to focus on your breath that's right beautiful and focus on

449
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:23,200
love for others visual objects yep

450
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:29,520
yep and so respecting respecting our each of us our own path

451
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:34,640
right whether it's we have body challenges breath challenges

452
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:40,400
you know all kinds of things so listening listening to what you know

453
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:46,880
what what will work talking asking questions there's a question from youtube that

454
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,920
i'll read and then we'll we'll start to shift into a second set

455
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:58,799
of instructions but boy this was so rich i wish we had more time right

456
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:04,559
do you feel so much benefit of hearing people share their experience

457
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:10,720
tremendous tremendous and so we'll also be around after the class formally ends

458
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:16,559
we'll hold the container but if there's anything else that you want more support around or want to

459
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:22,400
share afterwards we'll be here okay so

460
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:28,079
this this is a question thank you from youtube it's reads in zen students work with

461
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:33,280
teachers closely one-on-one and do such regular meetings happen in

462
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:40,000
mindfulness meditation and so the answer to that would be probably the simplest

463
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,280
answer is to come to day-long retreats where it says

464
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:51,200
there will be discussions with teachers to sign up for

465
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:58,240
there is one i mentioned scheduled for september 10th and we will be offering

466
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:03,599
you know discussions with students during that time

467
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,640
so day long's half days with gil or other teachers here on wednesdays is a

468
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:13,760
time to get to talk to a teacher about your practice they're short

469
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:20,000
10 15 minutes you just kind of go in you have a particular thing like

470
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:27,040
you know that you're struggling with and you get a little bit of advice for practice and you go practice

471
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:32,400
retreats are set up so that you get um and you know group and sometimes

472
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,680
individual um discussion times with teachers so within this tradition those

473
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:42,880
are the primary ways that you get that kind of guidance and feedback and

474
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:49,359
coming to a class like this where there's question and answer as well yeah okay coda i'm going to hand you this

475
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:54,319
little handy-dandy little microphone thanks

476
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:02,960
as we do a transition if you want to stand up again and shake it out or if you're comfortable you're welcome to you're welcome to keep

477
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:10,200
your seat but just want to give that as an option because we've been still and seated for a long time

478
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,319
all right

479
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:54,799
so there's this old teaching story

480
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:01,280
speaking of students and teachers this old teaching story of a student going to a teacher and asking what's the

481
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,960
essence of the practice and the teacher writes on a piece of paper

482
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:14,000
one word attention then holds it up shows it and the student goes is that all

483
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,839
and then the teacher takes the paper back and writes attention attention it shows them the shows them the paper

484
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,599
actually attention over and over again

485
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:30,799
again this uh this basic notion of mindfulness that's going to travel with us across the weeks and through our

486
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:36,240
practice to notice

487
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:41,279
just what's happening while it's happening

488
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:49,440
just to notice if it's pleasant or it's unpleasant just to notice and for this week

489
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:55,680
establishing and nurturing this connection between attention

490
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:01,599
and the breathing body the attention and the sensations of breathing

491
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:09,599
and this doesn't um it's not limited to our cushion what we're going to talk about right now is establishing a daily practice

492
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,519
finding your practice at home

493
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:21,520
something that experience tells us is that in order to develop the skill

494
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:27,599
of paying attention to what's happening while it's happening and to sort of experience the pleasures

495
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:34,480
that come through the practice and the sense of integrity and healing and goodness

496
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:39,680
or getting in touch with something really deep in ourselves it's very helpful to to do the practice

497
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:46,240
daily so the encouragement the encouragement for

498
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:53,839
these five weeks is to sit each day if you can um i want to talk a little just give a

499
01:01:53,839 --> 01:02:00,480
couple of things for you to consider as you're establishing a daily practice one

500
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,520
can be really helpful to do a conscious reflection at the beginning and at the end

501
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:10,559
particular way that we're going to suggest here at the beginning

502
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:16,160
very very helpful to enlist the whole mind and body by saying

503
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:22,400
or saying or thinking to yourself deliberately setting the intention now i'm going to be

504
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:28,559
attentive and mindful for this period of time it's really remarkable how much that

505
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:35,839
sort of aligns the system just by making that simple intention for yourself

506
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:43,039
and then um along with that intention making the intention to for the for the time being

507
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:48,559
for the say 20 minutes of your practice i'm going to let go of my preoccupations

508
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:53,760
the important ones will be right there for me when i'm done right there or they'll or they'll

509
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:59,039
accompany me during the during the whole set but at least i have that intention

510
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:04,240
so that's the beginning of the setting at the end of the sitting

511
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:10,559
very helpful to to take half a minute just to reflect on how it

512
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:17,520
went just to reflect on what happened it's not a it's not so much a time to evaluate or criticize or or anything

513
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:22,799
like that but just to take the moment to sort of knead the water back into the

514
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:30,838
dough this is what happened this was the mindfulness that i had this is how this experience went

515
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:36,400
in addition to that just like we were hearing in the in the

516
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:42,400
q a a few minutes ago everyone has their their path that's unfolding for them

517
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:48,720
through their own body and mind all of us also have

518
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:54,000
our own home with its unique

519
01:03:54,240 --> 01:04:00,000
characteristics your context is going to present its uh its own little its own little challenges some of them we have

520
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,079
in common um

521
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:12,079
i mentioned the home because it it it's ideal to have a place in your home

522
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:19,920
where you always do your sitting if you have the space have that one spot kind of out of the way so

523
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:27,359
people aren't walking by you it's pretty quiet if that's possible so that when you go to sit down

524
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:32,799
you have the best chance of being not disturbed for that amount of time

525
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:38,240
um i have found it really helpful to do

526
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:43,520
meditation in the morning there's something about the machinery of the mind starting to click on if i if i get

527
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:48,720
involved with the phone or i start reading the news or if i get into the first activity of the day

528
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:54,480
where it's actually harder for the mind to collect into mindfulness so i i try to do it first thing in the

529
01:04:54,480 --> 01:05:00,400
morning if i can other people have a different system where it it's almost like the the mind

530
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:07,599
and body naturally coalesce into mindfulness or collectedness in the late afternoon

531
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:14,960
or in the evening so feeling to feel into what's going to work for your own circumstances

532
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:24,079
let's see something i would like to emphasize

533
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:30,559
is that it uh if there are other other people who live in your household this is true for many of us

534
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:36,960
i find it really helpful to have a conversation to sort of in not not enlist them to

535
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:42,559
hold you accountable or something like i don't want someone saying did you meditate today

536
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:48,319
but it is really helpful to to let them know of your intention you know i think i'm gonna i think i'm gonna for these

537
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:54,880
five weeks i'm going to try sitting at such and such a time it would be helpful if we could

538
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:03,078
if i could have your support in that i found that particularly helpful

539
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:09,520
so the place the time the intention

540
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:18,350
i think the one of the takeaways i want to i want to emphasize here is that

541
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:24,559
[Music] this is a process of experimentation a little bit of trial and error in terms

542
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:31,760
of time of day and the sort of the sort of um context in which you're practicing

543
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:37,280
try something out see how it works give it a go make adjustments

544
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:43,520
and maybe we'll learn something about learn something about how to sustain a practice at home

545
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,720
after five weeks of trying that

546
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:58,559
we're going to move into another guided meditation

547
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:04,039
so if you'd like to find your meditation posture again

548
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:19,760
welcome welcome there's questions if you want to grab a question

549
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:25,000
yeah go ahead we're just about to do another

550
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:42,599
so

551
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:52,280
yay people taking care of themselves

552
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:07,520
all right finding ourselves again

553
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:15,039
with an alert upright spine supported by the sitting base

554
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:24,278
alert spine relaxed wide shoulders

555
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,960
tucked chin and softly closed eyes

556
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:39,080
returning to this practice that we're emphasizing for the week

557
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:45,278
sustaining contact between attention

558
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:49,318
and the sensations of breathing

559
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:58,798
sustaining contact between attention

560
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:02,400
awareness noticing

561
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:11,679
and the felt experience of breathing wherever it's most predominant

562
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:21,238
maybe the nose

563
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:28,480
maybe the sensations in the throat standing out

564
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:38,080
maybe it's more easeful now to feel breathing in the whole body

565
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:49,799
or to let go of the breathing

566
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:57,480
and be attentive to the sense of sitting just where you are

567
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,600
to sustain contact

568
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:41,220
one support can be offering

569
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:48,880
[Music] a very very soft note or a label

570
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:55,520
that coincides with the breathing say on the inhale in

571
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,480
perhaps on the exhale out

572
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:14,559
or if you are noticing the breathing in the chest or in the belly

573
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:20,000
you may note rising with the sensations of rising

574
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:26,039
falling with the sensations of falling

575
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:37,400
it doesn't have to be the right word

576
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:46,239
but just a very simple very soft thought

577
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:50,119
to help keep you here

578
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,800
in this particular practice

579
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:49,480
to be attentive to the breathing just as it is naturally

580
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:57,198
to be a naturalist of the in-breath whether it's long or short

581
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:09,040
a naturalist of the out-breath long or short

582
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,800
just as it is

583
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,520
so

584
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:20,400
whether the experience is pleasant or unpleasant

585
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:27,080
just to notice is enough

586
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:38,320
and with this support the very soft whisper in the mind

587
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:46,880
rising falling

588
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:54,960
or if you're aware of the whole body maybe sitting

589
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,840
sitting

590
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,880
in this last minute of this sitting

591
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,440
checking in with yourself

592
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:58,320
tuning in to just how how much effort is needed

593
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:07,080
to sustain contact here and now

594
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:37,929
so [Music]

595
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:48,080
so when you're ready you can open your eyes

596
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:54,800
so we we introduced a very very uh well-known tool

597
01:16:54,800 --> 01:17:00,960
in this tradition during this sitting some traditions will count the breathing

598
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:07,520
to help sustain attention and uh this tradition emphasizes using a tiny little

599
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:14,480
note label almost sounds too substantial to say that it's like can be like a little

600
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:21,679
puff a little in the mind very very soft

601
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:28,000
and there's a way that um it enlists the help of the thinking mind

602
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:34,719
the mind that uh really wants to veer off into its preoccupations

603
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:40,400
it's like you're you're making an ally of the thinking apparatus

604
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:45,320
to help you be here and now and attentive

605
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:57,000
so we have another 10 minutes for sharing questions comments responses

606
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,040
anything that came up

607
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:16,480
when you started you kind of shared all the recommended postures almost again like the most holistic postures but i noticed

608
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:22,080
myself fluctuating every minute and is it more important to like just to be comfortable

609
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:28,159
versus kind of still and regimented in a certain posture sure sure i think both

610
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:35,440
of those things have their time there's a there's a time for

611
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:41,280
practicing and cultivating a sort of skill in stillness and

612
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:47,040
it's really important i think to like ease into that ease into that

613
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:54,239
um you'll notice when we when we were doing the posture instruction i was sort of delighted when i saw people pop up and

614
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:59,920
get cushions and move around a little bit like i said it's very very well worth

615
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:05,040
the time to sort of invest in finding the right posture for you

616
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:10,800
and i would suggest being very gentle as we move in if your body needs to move

617
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:16,320
let it move um we're pretty um i'll speak for myself only can be pretty

618
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:24,920
wound up and there's a lot of unwinding that that has to happen so please please take care

619
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,800
holly has a hand

620
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:55,440
oh it's okay you've got your mask okay thank you tanya thank you kodo for

621
01:19:55,440 --> 01:20:00,880
this and thank you and um very grateful to be here as well i sometimes i find

622
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:06,719
that when i'm sitting or i'm trying to meditate i'm just emphasizing on the the effort

623
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:12,639
rather than being present yeah and as many people noted sometimes it's

624
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:19,920
posture that i'm thinking about or being comfortable or thinking about things and from

625
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:27,199
the past or worries of the future that kind of become my problems for right now

626
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:33,840
so i just sometimes i don't know if my practice is going anywhere

627
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:40,400
and but i i still persist because i know it's important and i i feel like i have

628
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:47,520
i have a heightened sense of awareness now but in that awareness i'm like oh gosh

629
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:53,600
here i go again i'm like let me just try and breathe but then

630
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:59,520
i know the thoughts don't go away and everything but it's just being okay with it

631
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:05,920
and all that stuff so thank you everyone can i ask you something yes

632
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:11,920
you said um you know what's important how do you know

633
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:19,040
how do you know it's important you know i know it's probably not important and

634
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:26,480
it's the stuff in my it's the narrative that i've told myself over the years and now i

635
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:34,400
in the effort of trying to sit with my thoughts and just like just try and see them like passing

636
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:40,000
clouds i just i get confused because i don't know if it's

637
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,040
my own thinking or the make-believe yeah yeah

638
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:50,639
yeah you want to say something

639
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:57,120
sure unless you have a thought you want to give right away go ahead yeah

640
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:04,400
um what i feel inclined to say one is i saw a lot of heads nodding

641
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:11,840
i think there's a lot of relating to the kind of experience you're describing um

642
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:18,639
certainly wondering is this is this going right is this going anywhere

643
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:25,199
uh but i mean look what's going on in here one of the one of the

644
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:31,280
one of the paradoxes of mindfulness practice is that as as we begin to be established in

645
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:36,560
mindfulness we become more aware as we become more aware

646
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:43,360
more is revealed it may well be actually that things are getting more still for you

647
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:47,280
but there's more visibility now

648
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:53,760
possible possible subjectively it may not look that way

649
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,800
i also wanted to highlight that mindfulness of thinking

650
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:04,239
is advanced practice mindfulness of thinking takes a lot of

651
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:10,000
practice and i think i think if we if uh

652
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:15,760
sort of follow along with the instruction and sort of invest the time in each week

653
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:21,840
having the base of breathing the base of the body the base of mindfulness of emotion which is often

654
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:28,560
what's fueling some of the thinking then we're in a much better position to be able to relate to thinking skillfully

655
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:34,560
so uh maybe i want to i want to encourage you and i think um

656
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:39,679
i think you're coming here was was uh just the right thing

657
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:45,520
thank you so much the first half day retreat i attended was with judy cannon oh yeah i was

658
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:51,440
so excited because i was on summer vacation and and i was just like a little hesitant because i'm catholic and

659
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:56,800
i i practice every week and just you reiterating that it's okay

660
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:03,199
mindfulness and what was it buddhism don't you can still buddhism needs mindfulness

661
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:09,760
is required but but mindfulness doesn't need buddhism yeah and i'm glad i can still you know

662
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:18,400
align myself with both so thank you yeah okay i'm tempted to say one more thing

663
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:24,480
because there were so many nodding heads and that is you know you don't have to decide if those thoughts are important

664
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:29,520
or not while you're meditating you don't have to agree with them or disagree with them you don't have to

665
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:36,320
make them go away um just like respect them

666
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:42,639
let them be and like gentle like with respect like

667
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:48,960
as much as you can just okay that and breathing

668
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:54,880
and breathing oh in this breath just

669
01:24:54,880 --> 01:25:01,520
so that there's not this power struggle yeah okay

670
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:06,800
say one more thing yeah and then we'll move on i promise

671
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:16,400
rather than um let's see what can i say there's a there's a possibility

672
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:23,520
of thinking about breathing in the foreground and letting thinking move its way to the

673
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:29,760
background without the thinking necessarily having to stop it can kind of be

674
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:36,480
say if you're sitting sitting next to a stream and you're watching the stream go by and that's your breathing

675
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:42,159
there can be the sound of the birds are the people walking by behind you on a sidewalk

676
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:48,320
or the wind in the trees these are the thoughts most of your attention is here in the

677
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:55,719
foreground and it's okay it's okay the birds don't get in the way of the stream

678
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:04,760
maybe time for one more and then we'll have to transition

679
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:22,480
hello again thank you everyone um so i was going to say something about

680
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:29,520
pain but now i want to say something about my wrist the restlessness thing it was mine pertained to thoughts

681
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:34,639
and i found some advice from jack cornfield helpful to just say label it

682
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:40,159
wandering and just patiently go back to the breath over and over no matter how many times it took

683
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:46,719
and get a new thought wandering and another practice was i'm just labeling

684
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:52,719
them pleasant unpleasant or neutral thoughts i don't know if that's a good idea or

685
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:57,840
not but i think he said that was a good idea sure and then

686
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:04,320
i always talk about pain as if anyone has chronic pain i have it too and what i noticed today

687
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:10,719
from finally practicing mindfulness of the breath again after so long um

688
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:18,000
was that the changing postures and changing where i felt the breath allowed me to almost control the amount

689
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,440
of pain i was perceiving from my hand sure so i don't know

690
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:30,480
it's just an observation it's not like a lesson or something thank you holly

691
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:37,120
let me okay i can't resist find your big toe with your mind

692
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:43,440
just bring your awareness into your big toe you don't have to wiggle it just just as much as you can

693
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:49,679
and if you can't find your big toe find your thumb whatever you can with your awareness

694
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:56,320
just see what you can sense whether it touches another toe or finger or

695
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:03,280
coolness or warmth can you feel where the toenail fingernail is versus the bottom of the

696
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:08,320
toe okay now take a deep breath in and let go of

697
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:14,880
the toe and feel into your belly

698
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:20,639
bring your awareness as much as you can into the experience of the belly

699
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:26,719
see if you can relax it let it fall over your pants

700
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:32,560
feel the breath expanding in the belly

701
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,320
soft belly

702
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:43,840
all right in the next exhale let go of the belly

703
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:52,480
and find the top of your head with your awareness like where that soft spot is when you're

704
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:59,920
a baby see if you can feel the hairs the individual hairs on your head

705
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:06,639
your scalp just bringing your awareness there

706
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:15,760
okay and let go of that what happened to the big toe

707
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:22,320
when you were paying attention to the top of your head were you aware of your big toe

708
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:27,600
it disappeared but it didn't so this is the

709
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:34,800
the commodity that we're working with if you want to call it that is awareness and we can choose where we focus our

710
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:40,000
awareness that's the practice

711
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,199
right partly is learning to direct and that's why

712
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:51,600
you notice maybe less pain when you're paying attention to the breathing in a different part of the body we're just

713
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:57,600
redirecting the energy of awareness what we're taking in

714
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:04,320
yeah all right koto love it thank

715
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:10,080
you so to bring us to a close our last couple of minutes

716
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:18,239
um again tanya and i will be here afterwards if you have something more to share another question comes up

717
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:25,120
no class would be quite a class without a homework assignment

718
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:29,440
and we've mentioned most of these already

719
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:36,000
it's perfectly fine leave the class tonight

720
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:42,800
don't think about meditation for the whole week perfectly fine and

721
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:49,440
the way the class is built sequentially you can get a lot of benefit if you practice practice in between as we go

722
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:55,600
along so we recommend a daily practice start with 20 minutes this week

723
01:30:55,600 --> 01:31:01,600
i'll have to confer with my esteemed colleague about progressive increasing but we'll

724
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:07,679
talk about that so 20 minutes one time a day

725
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:13,520
and focus on mindfulness of the breathing as we practiced it there's a there's a handout that's

726
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:19,440
available online and there are a few there on the end of the stage also that have instructions and also review of

727
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:24,800
some of the major points second thing

728
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:30,560
is to choose some routine activity that you do during the day

729
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:36,480
could be brushing your teeth could be washed washing the dishes walking here or there

730
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:41,920
and experiment with doing that with a little

731
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:48,000
mindfulness careful attention so um don't have your radio on in the background

732
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:54,400
conversation going on just that one thing just this well well it's time to do this

733
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:59,320
take nothing i think loved washing the dishes

734
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:04,639
and then the third thing is that similar to the second

735
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:10,080
extending this mindfulness practice off the cushion because the boundary is arbitrary

736
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:17,600
between the cushion and everything else in your life tuning into the sensations of the body

737
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:23,760
while you're doing any normal activity for about half an hour i could try doing that once this week

738
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:28,880
and see how that goes um

739
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:35,120
and then after after after tuning in for that half an hour just check in what

740
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:41,120
happened how was that kind of like the reflections we recommend at the end of the settings is there any change that i notice is

741
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:47,360
there any bit of well-being here am i more agitated than i was at the beginning

742
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:54,400
if it's not what you expect that's the path if you're aware enough to notice

743
01:32:54,400 --> 01:33:00,158
you're doing the practice whatever it looks like

744
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:07,440
i want to extend my thanks to all of you i am really delighted

745
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:14,159
so nice to be here with you at imc i'm looking forward to getting to know each of you a little bit as we go

746
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:20,880
um tanya is there anything you would like to say to close you can't do it wrong

747
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:28,920
okay okay thank you thank you so much

748
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,360
you
