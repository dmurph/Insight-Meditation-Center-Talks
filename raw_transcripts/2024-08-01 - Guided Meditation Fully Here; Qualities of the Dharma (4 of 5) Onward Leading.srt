1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:06,839
so hello everyone and Welcome to our morning meditation for some of you it's the

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,519
afternoon or maybe the evening and

3
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:20,240
um there's a wonderful saying about the path of meditation

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,760
mindfulness meditation that uh can be very useful to keep in

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,200
mind and that is um the saying the fastest

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:39,960
way to go from point A to point B is to be fully at Point

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,079
a so of course that doesn't relate not true everywhere but it's something very

8
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,559
true about the practice of meditation it's kind of like

9
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:58,600
um um little bit like sometimes trying to fall asleep and the more we try to fall

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,680
asleep the the harder it is to fall asleep and there's something about

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,680
letting go of the effort to try to go to sleep and just allow oneself to be as one is that sometimes creates the better

12
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,280
conditions to fall asleep or to relax certainly we can do some relaxation

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,840
willfully but uh there's also a deeper relaxation that comes when we just are

14
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,159
present with ourselves as we are without adding anything without picking anything

15
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,200
up without reac acting and the whole system physical

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,880
mental emotional system sometimes can just settle in that process and the fastest

17
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:49,079
way to settle is just to be relaxed about how you are and so um the analogy the Buddha

18
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:56,360
gives is uh uh if you stay in the middle of a river if

19
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,240
you're kind of floating in the river and don't grab the band branches don't try to row

20
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,479
upstreams um and just allow your don't try to and don't kind of like you know

21
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:14,480
sink but stay floating um just be there in the floating uh without trying to go

22
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,360
anywhere the stream will carry you along and maybe carry you along better than if

23
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,760
you try to swim if you try to swim Downstream you'll get tired after some hours but if you just kind of rest in

24
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:34,319
the current and avoid grabbing onto the branches on the side or um avoid getting

25
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,519
stuck on the sandb bars the current will carry you and so the fastest way to

26
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:47,560
get to to the ocean on the in the river is to uh stay fully in the current where

27
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:54,040
it is here so um

28
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,879
so for this to work in meditation uh we have to keep in mind

29
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:06,400
mind there is an onward leading nature there is an idea that where there is a place to go to Greater freedom to

30
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,840
Greater uh capacity for an open heart and for uh less

31
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:20,200
suffering there is the Dharma is very Developmental and nature there is a place to go trust that

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,720
and trust that there's something about just being fully present here that allow puts us in the current allows something

33
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,760
to unfold much better than if we're trying to to engineer and make it happen

34
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,120
ourselves and uh for this to work then uh it's not just a matter of being fully

35
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,200
here but being fully here in a with

36
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,599
awareness to be cognizant to be have the uh ability to be conscious of this

37
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:59,239
moment be fully Alive to be um uh feel the Vitality feel the sh whatever degree

38
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,360
of CL ity or sharpness that's possible for you to just recognize oh this is how

39
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,200
it is now and um sometimes it's stepping away from the

40
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,799
fry the chaos all the activity and being able to just step aside and just see it

41
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:21,000
for what it is sometimes it's being in the middle of it and kind of waking up

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,680
and oh this is how it is sometimes we're aware of details sometimes we we we're

43
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,759
aware of kind of the whole party of what's happening but the important thing

44
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,199
is this ability just be here with consciously be here with awareness be

45
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:46,520
here knowingly ah this is how it is uh and if in that knowing we feel strain we see a

46
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:54,360
pushing uh trying a lot if it's possible relax that let go of that and if it's

47
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,919
not possible uh just know that clearly and don't make it a problem

48
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,680
so to assume a meditation

49
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:15,160
posture and the posture Can Begin by feeling where the weight of your body

50
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:22,319
rests against some surface the chair the floor a bed wherever it is that the

51
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:28,960
weight of the body rests and this is here this is a this is

52
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:36,400
the place where you are right now and to let the weight of your body

53
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,400
how it feels resting against the surface to

54
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,199
be the beginning of arriving

55
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:59,680
here now and then gently feeling

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,280
the weight of your body Above This surface you're sitting the Torso in

57
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,639
that's in an upright posture if you're standing maybe the

58
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:20,599
legs and the joints of the hips that are activated and if you're lying down

59
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:27,120
maybe it's a feeling of the length of your body

60
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:40,560
gently closing your eyes and feeling as globally as you

61
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,960
can your body how your body is

62
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,919
now and the idea of a global awareness is one that for a few

63
00:06:52,919 --> 00:07:00,479
moments doesn't focus on any particular place any particular discomfort Comfort

64
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:07,800
or habit of being with something broad

65
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:15,400
wide awareness of the body as it is here

66
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:26,280
now and within this body to take some gently deeper

67
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,919
breaths maybe 3/4 ERS filling the

68
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,879
lungs and on the exhale

69
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,199
relaxing relaxing the body

70
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:54,639
into here into just this moment just here this experience

71
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,199
letting the breathing return to

72
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:18,759
normal and is there anything happening for you that keeps you away from here and

73
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:25,319
now any thoughts concerns emotions which are preoccupying

74
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:32,719
you and if there

75
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:39,279
is is there any tension in your body associated with that

76
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:50,560
concern feel that tension and if and within the global

77
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,959
body as if the global full body supports

78
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,440
you relax that tension

79
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,600
soften the physical tension associated with any concerns that preoccupy

80
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,560
you around the eyes

81
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:28,279
forehead the [Music] shoulders chest the belly

82
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,160
breathing a normal

83
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,959
breath perhaps the experience of

84
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:50,360
breathing is at the center of

85
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,600
a point a to be fully here at Point a is

86
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,120
the fastest way to get to B

87
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,440
to feel the body's experience of

88
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:25,360
breathing and if you'd like you could ever so gently say the

89
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,640
word softly lightly in the mind say the word

90
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,160
here as you breathe in and ever so

91
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:45,240
lightly lovingly say the word now as you

92
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,320
exhale so that these two words are a

93
00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:00,079
reminder to not try to get anything or make anything happen

94
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:08,800
to just be awake to the experience of Here and

95
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Now

96
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240

gently sing the word here as you breathe in now as you

107
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:17,480
exhale but doing so as a pointer to the

108
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,880
experience of the body breathing now and

109
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:30,840
here pointing to sensing and feeling

110
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,320
Here and

111
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840

125
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320

126
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

127

for e

130
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,679
and then as we come to the end of the

131
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:58,559
sitting to imagine remember

132
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:05,799
maybe visualize yourself being

133
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:12,120
present with another person maybe a person who you feel safe

134
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:18,279
with you don't need to act on desires or

135
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:26,640
aversions responsibility or and there's occasion just to be

136
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:34,278
present here and now maybe listening to the

137
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:42,760
person clear recognition of the person where you're not caught in ideas

138
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,880
of Praise or blame or right and

139
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,279
wrong responsibility or

140
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:03,080
expectations and may that ability to be fully present here in an open clear

141
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:08,640
mindful way be a vehicle be a

142
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:18,320
means by which to respect others care for others love

143
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:26,760
others for people to be seen clearly is a form of

144
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:33,360
love May it be that the practice of being present supports all of

145
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,600
us to love or care or respect everyone

146
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:46,559
we encounter especially the people for whom it might be hard to do

147
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,840
this may it be that this practice we do is not just for our own

148
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:58,640
sake but for the sake of bringing goodness happiness care

149
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:06,559
care to the people we encounter may all beings be

150
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:15,760
happy may all beings be safe may all beings be

151
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:22,799
peaceful and may all beings everywhere be free

152
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:34,259
[Music]

153
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:39,960
thank you

154
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:32,559
so hello everyone and welcome to this fourth talk on the five qualities of the

155
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:40,000
Dharma and there's two ways of understanding the word Dharma here one is um it's the teachings of the Buddha

156
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,960
so these are five qualities characteristics of the of those teachings how we can recognize what's

157
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:52,720
essential in those teachings but sometimes the Dharma is uh considered to be the

158
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,519
inner the processes the movements the development the growth the

159
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:04,279
unfolding that happens when we practice an unfolding which sometimes feels like

160
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:09,440
not that we're doing it but that we're being practiced that we are almost getting out

161
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,360
of our own way and allowing something deep inside to unfold to grow to mature

162
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,960
to expand and a lot of Dharma practi is creating the conditions of being so

163
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:29,519
fully present here and in being here having the right condition for something

164
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:36,480
to flower and uh practicing the EF path PR practicing ethics learning how to be

165
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,720
present and mindful in a non-reactive non-manipulative way just fully present

166
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,519
with care and attention is phenomenal in setting free some process of maturation

167
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:55,880
and growth so the fourth characteristic of the Dharma is that the Dharma is onward

168
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:03,880
leading So It Begins by by saying the D the Dharma is something that's visible here and now it's something that's

169
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:11,679
immediate it's something that invites you to come take a deeper look and as we are looking deeply as we

170
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,799
see more clearly one of the things we start seeing and feeling and sensing is

171
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:24,320
this uh that it that uh the Dharma in us the movement in US of practice is not

172
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,600
static it's not fixed but there's a feeling oh here is where it can grow if

173
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:36,399
I let go here if I bring attention here if I give myself to the practice now

174
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:43,399
something's asking to grow something's asking to unfold something wants to be born something wants to be released

175
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:50,240
something wants to be healed uh something wants to be understood there's all this kind of movement of something

176
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:58,799
here wants to grow and develop and we can sometimes feel that and and and and

177
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:05,039
then uh allow for it or give into it or practice because of it or in that

178
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,398
direction and um in the sense that that's onward leading and that's Dharma

179
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,720
is developmental is actually built into the Buddhist teachings over and over and

180
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,960
over again his teachings follow a development developmental model that

181
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,158
he's presenting um teachings and practices that are relevant for

182
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,599
different uh point points of maturation and growth and uh even in a single

183
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:38,358
Retreat for example even a single meditation there's a a variety of changes that happen and knowing how to

184
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:45,599
meet those changes recognize those changes to allow them to keep unfolding is part of how why it's valuable to

185
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:51,118
learn the Buddhist teachings in some detail and this idea that it's onward

186
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:57,760
leading this idea that uh that developmental is not opposed to a common

187
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,880
an idea that in mindfulness practice we want to sit and be really accepting of this present

188
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:10,000
moment and um and what that means is that we're not rejecting right now we're

189
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,240
not trying to fix right now we're not trying to get someplace now right now uh

190
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,800
because fixing and and resisting and rejecting all those actually move us in

191
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:27,040
the opposite direction to Freedom they they actually interfere with this growth

192
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,400
that can happen in the Dharma and um and so the idea of being

193
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:40,359
fully present here for what's here is not for its own sake but uh uh it can be

194
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:47,320
it's beautiful just to kind of feel this full presence to experience here and now but it's also for the sake of allowing

195
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:54,760
this process of growth to unfold without our interference and in the and in truth I

196
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:02,160
think the Buddha never talked about practicing acceptance uh uh he actually talked about letting

197
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:09,040
go of both acceptance and rejection um that uh both those

198
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,480
interfere with the Dharma and how I understand that is that the active conscious movement of accepting

199
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:22,079
something is a little bit too much like condoning or a little bit too involved and engaged with the process of what's

200
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,599
happening and there is a deeper more peaceful way of being present that uh

201
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:35,040
allows things to be as they are but we don't have to take the next step of accepting it um or rejecting it but

202
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:42,319
seeing it clearly just really see seeing that is not for or against seeing that

203
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:50,000
is not accepting or rejecting seeing that just see something in a very respectful way that this is how it is

204
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,200
now look at this and then take a deeper look remember that's the characteristic of come and see come and take a deeper

205
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,440
look discover what's here everything you need to discover about the Dharma you can

206
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:10,240
really discover here in your own experience if you take a deeper look if you're really present and patient and

207
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:18,520
not trying to analyze not trying to uh fix or but to really tune in and allow

208
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:25,240
things to reveal themselves show themselves to us and what we do is

209
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:31,880
adjust how we see how we look as I said yesterday what we're looking for is in

210
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:39,160
the looking that it's a very profound thing to to uh notice how we're mindful

211
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:44,319
how we're attending to our experience so the mindfulness the seeing the

212
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:51,240
attending doesn't contain inside of it um uh rejection or clinging or wanting

213
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,880
or pushing or uh entanglement with experience but it's just kind of very

214
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,400
simple clear seeing and the simplest free knowing of the

215
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,280
experience and as we do that that creates the conditions to know something better to know something without our

216
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,480
projections without our our um our interference with them and that's what

217
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:22,680
meant by come and see see deeply what he let things reveal themselves to us so I

218
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,800
think it's one of the very uh inspiring encouraging aspects of this D our

219
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:34,359
practice is that um uh it is developmental it does flow it does move

220
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:40,000
we do grow there is a maturation um and the ancient language

221
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,599
is um where it's like a fruit that uh matures until it's ripe and something

222
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:52,079
inside of us that keeps growing and um and we know we see in

223
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,440
children how children develop grow developmentally in stages that kids grow

224
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:05,200
grow and develop physically emotionally psychologically intellectually and and um and I would

225
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:12,560
say that uh some of that continues beautifully wonderfully in Dharma practice as we become adults and go into

226
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,880
adulthood but also um uh spiritually there's a kind of spiritually a

227
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:26,440
spiritual growth and development a development in these beautiful qualities that come as we discover how to be Freer

228
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:33,920
and Freer and um the qualities of kindness and Good Will and compassion the qualities

229
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,640
of equinity and peace and joy and happiness so the Dharma is onward

230
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:47,960
leading and um and one of the ways to support that onward leading is this practice I said during

231
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,880
the meditation that the fastest way to go from point A to point B is to be

232
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:01,440
fully at Point a uh to be in a Hur wor to get to point B maybe we'll never get to point

233
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,000
B but if you're fully at a at least in the meditation practice and Dharma

234
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:15,599
practice that's can be sometimes the way that something begins to unfold let go relax settle open up um much better than

235
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,760
if we willfully are trying to fix and change and resist and deny and ignore uh

236
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,880
our experience but to wake up here to

237
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,760
neither accept nor reject but to be awake in the

238
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:39,079
field of awareness in the field of wisdom of course there's a time to change things

239
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:47,960
field of wisdom and Street smarts there's a time to say no and this can't be or yes let's do this but in the field

240
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:54,160
of awareness the field of presence to learn to just be present and hold it

241
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,599
wisely and clearly and freely and openly is one of the great gifts of this

242
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:07,079
practice and that's a gift which we can offer to others and it's remarkable

243
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:14,800
the onward leading nature of our friends our strangers our enemies uh when we

244
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:22,000
bring kind open um awake attention to really know them to listen to them to be

245
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,280
with them and um don't interfere don't judge don't try to fix but really be

246
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,520
present in a kind supporting respectful way um listening deeply sometimes you

247
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:41,720
can watch how people relax and open and become happier and in our relationships

248
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:47,960
too there's an onward leading nature of moving uh the relationships to healthier

249
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:57,440
and healthier States and um so this practice is onward leading

250
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,920
and uh and and ultimately according to the Buddha this practice is onward

251
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:12,160
leading and carrying us along like a current in a river to uh uh to neana to

252
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,880
the the mind the heart's fullest capacity capability to be free of every

253
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,960
single clinging every single resistance to be free of suffering it's one of the

254
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,480
greatest things that uh we can experience and then to offer that to

255
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,839
support others to do the same is also phenomenal so the onward leading nature

256
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:42,160
of experience so the five qualities of the Dharma the first four is it's uh

257
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:48,160
directly visible here and now it's immediate it's uh inviting us to inspect

258
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,359
for ourselves to see for ourselves and it is onward

259
00:42:53,359 --> 00:43:00,040
leading and tomorrow we'll do the last one which is um uh to be personally

260
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:06,040
experienced by the wise and tomorrow uh when we finish uh

261
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:11,119
we here at 7:45 we'll have a zoom meeting um just a

262
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:17,079
gathering to meet and uh and I'll answer questions from you um chance for some

263
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:23,400
discussion we'll probably do a little breakout group maybe groups of four for 10 12 minutes or something so you say

264
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,720
