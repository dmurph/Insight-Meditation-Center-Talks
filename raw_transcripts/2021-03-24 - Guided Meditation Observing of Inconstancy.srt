1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,599
warm hellos from redwood city

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:16,160
and uh i appreciate all the good mornings and the warmth that it comes kind of

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:24,560
radiating out of the chat here so thank you for those who are making the greetings and and

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,320
thanks to all those of you who have those kinds of greetings in your heart

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,680
so we're continuing with mindfulness of breathing and one of the functions one of the

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,120
wonderful functions or potentials of mindfulness of breathing

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,600
is a combination of doing both mindfulness and concentration practice

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:57,680
that we are both developing a steadiness of mind to stay on the breath to really rest in the breathing or

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,158
stay kind of immersed in the world of breathing without being pulled into extraneous

10
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,920
thoughts and ideas and feelings and it can be a real delight to

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,560
simplify the mind even our life in a certain way and be absorbed in one thing in this

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,880
case the breathing and it's not necessarily the breathing is so wonderful and as it is the absorption the really

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,520
kind of intimacy with it that intimacy and connection continuity opens up a whole different inner world

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,040
of possibility and one of those possibilities is to observe

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,479
carefully the experience of breathing which is really where the passana practice practice of insight

16
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:52,240
begins opening up and to distinguish to highlight what observing means

17
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,720
we can distinguish between

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:06,960
looking seeing and observing looking is an active function

19
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:14,720
we if we look at if we say look look look at look for look for the needle and the haystack

20
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,920
then um there's a kind of staring that might go on you might kind of really

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,959
actively engage the eyes to see and try to find the thing that we've been asked to look

22
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,319
for and so it's an and it might be very active engaged

23
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,920
and um and even the head might go forward and the eyes may be you know more fixated as

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,720
it kind of really searches the terrain uh to see uh in the more

25
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,720
passive sense of the word or there's less active senses of the word

26
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:56,560
it's just the i see there doesn't have to be an intention to see determination to see any effort to find

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,599
anything or look anything particular there's just seeing happens and we might

28
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:09,200
not even choose what we see it's just new things come in and you just see that for now

29
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,720
and it's more receptive quality than the active quality of looking and observing has a little bit

30
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,319
of both qualities observing has

31
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:29,519
the the receptive quality of just seeing not interfering not trying so hard not

32
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,159
staring at anything fixating on something but it is also a little bit

33
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:43,120
intentional gentle loving determination intentionality to be intimate with the

34
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,599
experience to really get closer and really feel and sense and experience it in a

35
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,360
more precise way and a little bit like you're still seeing

36
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,760
within that kind of receptive mode but you've placed a magnifying glass

37
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:09,280
or you're still seeing but you've gotten really close so i've had a history of being

38
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,920
nearsighted and that's a little bit changing now with cataract surgery in one eye

39
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:23,199
but uh still my right eye is nearsighted and if i keep my eye my hand you know

40
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,960
three feet away from my myself i see that i have a hand but i don't see many details at all

41
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,360
it's a little bit fuzzy but as i bring it closer i can see really all the lines and the

42
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:43,759
fingerprints and i can see the details of my hand very nicely and and so i can still just seeing

43
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,919
but there's a things get highlighted and clear and clear so it's a little bit like that

44
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,120
the observing that we're building or finding discovering

45
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:03,120
that comes with being settled and immersed in the world of breathing is to now begin seeing this the subtlety

46
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,120
or the details the fingerprints almost of each little in-breath and out-breath

47
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:17,120
each little experience of breathing and so the observing has a little bit more of a little bit more maybe kind of

48
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,720
intimacy than just seeing might have but not the active kind of looking

49
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,840
forward and reaching for out that that looking would have

50
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:36,840
so to observe so that's kind of the so to take a comfortable meditation

51
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,918
posture and gently close your eyes

52
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,960
and relax let go soften your body

53
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:07,280
tune into your body see your body feel your body

54
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:15,360
and then within this body take a few long slow deep breaths

55
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,960
the purpose of which is to remind yourself now you're going to be

56
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:30,000
with your breathing that you're offering to accompany your

57
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,160
breathing and your breathing and ascent is going to accompany you

58
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,199
hand in hand you will go

59
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:49,440
and here you are you're saying hello to your breathing with these big breaths

60
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

61
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:06,080
and as a way of settling into your breathing more you might

62
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,800
relax your shoulders and as you relax your shoulders almost as if you're relaxing into the

63
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,840
body breathing

64
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,720
easing up some of the muscles and that are surrounding

65
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,840
the body's engagement and breathing

66
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,520
and the same thing with a belly to relax the belly as you breathe

67
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,520
so that there's a greater connection to breathing and freedom to breathing

68
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:59,840
and maybe there's also a softening in the chest the solar plexus area

69
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:10,560
and as you relax the chest it's almost like you're able to settle in more to the experience of the body

70
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,400
breathing if you experience the breathing mostly

71
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,639
in the nostrils maybe there's a way of softening relaxing your face

72
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:32,240
so that you settle more into the place where you feel the breathing

73
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:45,120
there as you exhale

74
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,320
to relax your thinking

75
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,839
calm your thinking a little bit

76
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:09,839
reassuring the mind that things are okay at this moment just for now here

77
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,079
as you exhale letting go of your thoughts

78
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:37,839
as you let go of your thoughts let go into your breathing

79
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,640
and in the beginning of this sitting keep returning to your breathing as

80
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:15,279
often as necessary but do so gently lovingly

81
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,880
do so in which in a way that the returning the beginning again

82
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:28,079
is pleasant the returning the beginning again itself

83
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,600
is done in a way that's calming relaxing

84
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,680
maybe a mental tai chi

85
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,839
where you flow awareness back into your

86
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
breathing

87
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:04,800
and then stay intimate with their inhales with the exhales

88
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,200
as if there's a wonderful tai chi dance between breathing and your

89
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,360
awareness why the breathe the awareness mirrors

90
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,680
the breathing follows the breathing

91
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,839
rides the breathing

92
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,519
and relaxing the mind's ability to be aware

93
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:03,440
so that the awareness of breathing is more receptive

94
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:11,920
than active but a receptivity that

95
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,720
is committed to the intimacy between awareness

96
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:35,839
and breathing

97
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,839
[Music] hmm

98
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
do

99
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,639
and then with a little bit more intimacy

100
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:34,000
awareness getting really close to the inhales and the exhales

101
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:41,839
begin to experience the details of sensations that come into play

102
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:49,519
as you breathe in that come into play as you breathe out

103
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,800
breathing in breathing out intimately

104
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:04,720
letting things letting the sensations that are connected to breathing begin to

105
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:12,320
stand out and highlight in the clarity

106
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:20,480
of awareness that's not swept away in thinking and thoughts

107
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:30,320
but becomes more like a soft relaxed magnifying glass that just

108
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:37,600
feels and senses intimately

109
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:43,279
the beginning the middle the end of the inhale

110
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,519
the beginning the middle and the end of the exhale

111
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,839
observing

112
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,039
observing the particular detail of your breathing

113
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:10,000
particular detail of all the sensations that come into play as you breathe

114
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,840
and that is those sensations are changing

115
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,280
no need to look at the details in any a different way

116
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:30,799
but begin observing the relaxed receptive way

117
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,720
how every sensation that comes into play as you breathe

118
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:45,440
changes by fading away or turning into something

119
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
else

120
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:11,200
maybe the way that waves washing up on a shore are constantly changing

121
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:25,840
as they wash up and roll back on the sand

122
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:53,840
immerse yourself in that changing landscape of breathing

123
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,240
observing in a relaxed but careful way

124
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,640
not only noticing how the sensations change

125
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:31,840
notice that some appear and disappear

126
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,080
an ongoing sequence of sensations that appear and disappear throughout the inhale

127
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,880
throughout the exhale no need to think about it or be involved

128
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,640
with them but allow those sensations to be known

129
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,840
as coming and going

130
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:30,159
as we observe the breathing allowing the sensations to come and go

131
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:39,600
on their own there is a giving of freedom to those sensations

132
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:49,840
there's allowing each of them to be its own self as it arises as it passes

133
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:03,840
and this way in which observing grants freedom

134
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:11,360
from our involvement our entanglement our fixing and wanting is a wonderful

135
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,840
lesson for how to be with others

136
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,159
to allow others to be as they are

137
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:32,559
to have the ability to be present and maybe even a certain intimacy or

138
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,200
closeness or attentiveness

139
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:45,360
we allow others to be who they are where others become free

140
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:53,760
of our desires our needs our expectations our fixing our wanting our bias

141
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,840
and interpretations

142
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:15,919
and to allow to let the deep capacity to observe this way

143
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:22,480
be registered deeply in the mind and the heart

144
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:31,279
and to stay close to it so we begin to find wise ways

145
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:41,840
of offering this freedom to others the freedom from what our minds does

146
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,799
and may it be that this meditation practice that we do

147
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,919
offers a lot of freedom

148
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,679
for others to be as they are

149
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:08,320
they might not recognize that you're granting them freedom because it's really a freedom that

150
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,399
within which how they are seen and received in ourselves

151
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:25,919
and it's a freedom that then also makes more room for the hearts tenderness

152
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:32,559
kindness love for others to shine forth

153
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,840
in a way this freedom that the mind grants to others

154
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,799
allows for space for more love care

155
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,960
and may it be that what we learn here

156
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,840
can be expressed in the words may others be happy

157
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,960
may others be safe

158
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,720
may others be peaceful

159
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,120
may others be free

160
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,440
and may others be included in my circle of care

161
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:48,640
a care that is characterized by

162
