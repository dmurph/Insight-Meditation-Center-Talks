5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,279
so for today's practice theme of metta

6
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,960
there's this little story that came up to my my mind and i wanted to share that

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,840
to set the stage um the story of

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,640
of um as i remember it um

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,199
someone walking on the beach and and uh picking up

10
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:02,399
starfish and throwing them back into the ocean so they would dry out and they would survive as as the

11
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,600
conditions were such that that was a possibility and maybe it was hot or whatever it was

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,200
and there were thousands of starfish on the beach and the friends seeing this

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,479
person picking them one by one and throwing them in the ocean says there are

14
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:28,400
thousands of starfish what are you doing this is madness you know but you're doing this doesn't make any difference

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:36,079
and the person who's doing this act of service says well it makes a difference to the starfish i'm throwing back

16
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,640
so i've loved that story i've loved that story because even if at times

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,759
it seems like oh how can our acts of kindness acts of service act so just

18
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,880
listening to one person giving or caring ear or not losing our temper just this

19
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,040
once just this this little tiny act of kindness like ah what difference does it

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,880
make just the world is so overwhelming by challenges but it makes a difference

21
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,760
of course it makes a difference it makes a difference to the starfish to that one starfish

22
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:19,440
it makes a difference to the that person we're not losing our temper with or being kind with or or patient with or

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,680
that person we're saying hello to um so many stories like this

24
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,519
um [Music] say you go for a walk and

25
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:39,280
you smile to someone who's looking down and looks stressed maybe it's a neighbor who's walking by you walking past you

26
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,599
you just smile at them maybe this is the gift the only human interaction they

27
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,879
have throughout the day it's another story i'm now remembering just echoes and vestiges of

28
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,200
it and just trying to find it but the story of of how simple human

29
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,720
kindness is of just a smile just a kind world have been instrumental and really have

30
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,720
kept other people going without the giver ever realizing that the simple act

31
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,760
of kindness the simple act of service that they were sharing was really so

32
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,840
profound really so um sustaining the other person's

33
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,560
connection to life connection to life so do not underestimate

34
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,200
the power of throwing one starfish back into the ocean one starfish

35
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,040

167
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,360
small or large and now i'd like to invite you

168
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:33,320
to consider an act of kindness meta

169
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,080
but you shared with someone else

170
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:48,240
maybe you were a helping hand you offered a helping hand or

171
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:55,679
patient ear whatever it might have been

172
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,240
now let yourself feel the nourishment of this kindness

173
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,600
this goodness let it glad in your heart

174
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:16,720
feeling the impact the appreciation of the other

175
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,320
first the starfish you threw this one starfish

176
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,080
you threw once into the ocean

177
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,880
breathing in breathing out

178
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,399
appreciating the interdependence in this kindness

179
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:45,760
letting your heart be buoyed uplifted

180
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:53,320
not a time to remember all the previous wrongdoings remember kindness

181
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:04,760
let your heart be glad maybe a smile shows up on your face welcome it

182
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:57,760
we are all starfish and we all have the capacity

183
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,720
to throw one starfish back into the ocean

184
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:10,638
so as we bring this practice period to close

185
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,720
offering offering the goodness

186
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,638
of our practice together

187
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,679
touching into kindness intentions of kindness recollecting kindness

188
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,358
turning our hearts our minds our mind stream towards kindness the

189
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:44,359
benefits the gifts appreciation of it this is time well spent

190
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,839
whatever you frequently ponder and reflect upon becomes the

191
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:59,200
inclination of your mind says the buddha

192
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,359
so we reflect together on kindness so that it becomes

193
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,680
the inclination of our hearts and minds

194
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:18,400
may all beings everywhere all starfish all starfish

195
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,119
hypothetical physical imaginal including ourselves the

196
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,880
starfish may all beings everywhere

197
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:40,039

211
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,359

not just profound but also fun it's good when practice is both and of course

213

218
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,839

219
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:39,920
to enter little little oceans little tide pools

220
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:46,079
in small groups in small groups of three and consider the the uh

221
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,440
each other as starfish and offering kindness offering kindness

222
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,680
offering kindness to ourselves to each other and the question reflection is what was

223
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:03,119
this practice like for you what came up whatever you like to share from your

224
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,420
first person experience and um

225
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:13,760
[Music] not managing not questioning not

226
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,920
you know guiding the group but just really from your own experience whatever you like to share

227
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,280
sharing one thing and then the next person will share one thing or they'll share silence say i'll pass i'll hold

228
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,920
silence today perfectly fine no expectation all welcome the third person will say something and

229
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,640
they'll come back to you so you'll go around a few times

264
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:21,119
larger group but a mantra i use when i feel a negative emotion arising is these

265
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:27,040
feelings are inside me and someone's actions triggered me uh actually triggered them i have the

266
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,960
power to ignite these feelings or not that is that's true yes it is out of context and you michel and yes i

267
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:40,640
appreciate the um yeah the the way that you're supporting yourself with uh with with this mantra

268

269
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:54,960
real quick uh i would say uh um i was in medical i i was in uh

270
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,240
beef college before i went off to uh professional school and i was working

271
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,440
for the police and the intelligence unions and another student was with me from high school and

272
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,440
uh found this suicide note that bliss had collected and in it i would never forgot these

273
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:17,520
words i felt intrusive upon he was intruded upon the suicide note but only to say that

274
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,680
he had been ridiculed in high school and my mother had asked me to reach out and protect them which i did and in the

275
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,960
suicide note he mentioned that i never forgot that

276
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:36,720
and he said that he even said maybe he did this because my mother was talking about this i did but it reminded me you

277
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,960
never know the effect of kindness oh

278
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,400
