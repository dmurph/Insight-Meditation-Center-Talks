1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:08,000
good morning good day everyone uh Could you type in the chat if you can hear me

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,320
okay I'm wondering if the sound is coming through all

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,520
right yes thank you very much um I'm so

4
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,800
delighted that I can be with this wonderful Sana every morning this week

5
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,920
um and I have to say it is so delightful to read the messages coming through chat

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,079
thank you so much for those um I'm especially happy to be doing this since

7
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,000
this week Falls between the holidays it is such a great time of year

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,920
year uh for reflection and for witnessing uh acts of generosity and

9
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:16,680
kindness um as well as the overwhelming need of all of humanity for

10
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:24,520
compassion so for these reasons and following Gil's beautiful talks last week about thinking I thought this week

11
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:31,280
we could focus on qualities of heart and mind um that are trans are called the

12
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,560
Brahma viharas which are often translated as Divine abodes or Heavenly

13
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,680
abodes uh and an abode of course is a place to dwell I I think of the Brahma

14
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:54,399
viharas as very wholesome places for the mind to dwell to hang out to live in

15
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,600
away uh the Brahma viharas are good will compassion

16
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,799
appreciative joy and equinity of course a wholesome states of

17
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:14,640
Mind are not limited to the list that I just gave um and there are so many

18
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,040
others which is wonderful um another wholesome state that I want to

19
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:28,040
particularly focus on today is generosity uh the virtue of giving and

20
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,640
it seems to underly each of the other Divine abodes and our practice in so

21
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,879
many different ways uh so that in fact sitting here and

22
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:45,680
reading the chats is like opening gifts and in a great form of

23
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,319
generosity um these beautiful states of Mind these Divine abodes and the state

24
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:59,360
of generosity excuse me don't happen by accident of course

25
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,760
they come come through taking care of one's mental state through the

26
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,319
meditations we do through mindfulness and we have this opportunity to

27
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,720
cultivate and reinforce helpful qualities of mind I think meditating in

28
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:22,280
a supportive group like this one that's uh so friendly uh to one another is a

29
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,319
generous Act of mutual support so with that as an

30
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,000
introduction let's settle into our

31
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,560
meditation beginning with giving yourself the time you

32
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,319
need to settle

33
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:00,400
in taking your time for settling into the posture

34
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:08,040
finding the state of alertness and relaxation that can be

35
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:25,160
supportive offering care for this body this heart and this

36
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:31,600
mind and how they are right in this moment

37
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:04,479
starting with knowing just exactly how we are right here and right

38
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,840
now feeling the gift of

39
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:37,360
breath breathing in and breathing out of all parts of yourself as you're

40
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,400
here the nourishment of kind

41
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:06,039
attention to soothe and feed all parts of the body

42
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:08,759
heart and

43
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,680
mind perhaps gradually scanning the body from head to

44
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,120
toe give some ease to each part of the

45
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,960
body that would benefit from

46
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:02,840
ease perhaps spending more time in any any area that seems to need your

47
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:10,479
attention or benefit from some extra breath in and breath

48
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:31,160
out releasing any extra tension that can be

49
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,000
released anything extra that you're carrying

50
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,360
around allowing the out breath to carry

51
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:53,280
that away and respecting any part of the

52
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,400
body that cannot be eased respecting and

53
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:06,360
giving it the attention of accepting it just as it

54
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,360
is the body heart and mind offer us

55
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,880
this record of conditions and how they've

56
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,080
been they show up in this moment perhaps

57
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:53,240
reflecting some of the things that have gone before and as we give kind

58
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,959
acknowledgment to that often those areas can then

59
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:05,320
feel the ease of settling into what's happening

60
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
now

61
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,279
perhaps feeling the aliveness of the entire

62
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:50,320
body as it sits here and now or lies down or

63
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:06,480
stands and recognizing with kindness any moods or emotions that are

64
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:20,120
present allowing each thing that comes to awareness it's time to be known to be

65
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,560
felt to be seen and

66
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
heard

67
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,959
and offering all emotions and moods that are here your good

68
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:54,600
will receiving messages from the heart in the same way that you would receive a

69
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,040
dear friend whether the friend is

70
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,200
in a great mood or the friend is facing

71
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:33,600
challenges in the same way gently

72
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,800
attending to the activity of the Mind as you would listen to the thoughts

73
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,560
of a friend accepting every

74
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:52,320
experience without joining them in those thoughts

75
00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:00,720
but respecting what they have to say having some generos I

76
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:08,440
it for how they are for how this mind

77
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
is

78
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,040
offering the gift of mindful attention to to each thing that comes to

79
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,959
awareness as phenomena come and go throughout the

80
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,600
meditation everything included nothing left out there is

81
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,240
no right or wrong meditation there's only kind awareness

82
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,079
for what is present in each moment that

83
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
arises

84
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
right

85
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
for

86
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:51,000
it's so delightful to be with you all and there is so much

87
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,080
generosity that is INRI inextricably part of Buddhist practice

88
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:06,679
as you give your time and attention to the body the heart the

89
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:13,440
mind this awareness this gift of mindfulness allows what is arising some

90
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,559
time and mental space to be known that gift of attention is one of

91
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:25,000
the keys to discovering and uprooting what causes

92
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,840
dissatisfaction stress suffer uing and by giving ourselves the time to get to

93
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:40,518
know the Mind deeply we learn we gradually learn how to find sustainable

94
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:46,760
happiness and this all started with an act of generosity and that was the

95
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:54,120
Buddhist conscious decision to teach so according to one suta that I uh

96
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:00,000
was reading when the Buddha was newly self-awakened he was said to have been

97
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:09,279
thinking something like this this Dharma that I have attained is deep hard to see hard to

98
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:16,679
realize peaceful refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle to be

99
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:22,919
experienced by the wise but this generation Delights an attachment is

100
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:29,039
excited by attachment enjoys attachment for a gener delighting in attachment

101
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,559
excited by attachment enjoying attachment then he goes on to name these

102
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:43,399
things that are going to be really hard for people to understand when they're so into attachment such as conditionality

103
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:50,559
this if this then that dependent co-arising the resolution of all

104
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:58,880
Fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the end of crazy cing

105
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:06,159
dispassion cessation unbinding and apparently you know the

106
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:12,360
the thought was if I were to teach the Dharma and others would not understand

107
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:18,440
me that would be tiresome and Troublesome for me so as he entertained

108
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:25,960
these thoughts The Story Goes that his mind was inclined instead to just dwelling at ease and not to teaching the

109
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:31,760
Dharma but this particular suta recounts that a

110
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:37,279
Brahma implored and persuaded him to teach by telling him that there were the

111
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:45,159
there were people there are people who would be able to understand and after that the Buddha

112
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:51,480
apparently decided that he would teach those who could hear the Dharma and had

113
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:57,080
conviction but then he went on to dedicate the REM the remaining decades

114
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:04,720
of his life to teaching so it's one thing to teach a few classes but imagine the generosity it

115
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:13,000
takes to spend every day every decade of one's adult life one's you know teaching

116
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,158
what is hard to convey and hard for others to understand so that's that's a

117
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,599
pretty amazing Act of generosity he didn't just discover this for himself he then passed it on and

118
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:29,638
then the next enormous active gener generosity um to which we owe the

119
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:35,320
practices we learn was that the generations of monastics who first

120
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,398
memorized and recited the teachings of the Buddha um and to anyone wanting to

121
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:47,919
hear the Dharma and then later recorded them in writing and then we're fortunate enough um In Our Lifetime that they've

122
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:53,560
been translated into languages that we speak and these weren't people who were

123
00:34:53,560 --> 00:35:01,520
setting out to make a a fortune from what they knew knew it was freely offered passed from one warm hand to the

124
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:11,640
next for the past 2,500 years so when we take in that fact 2500

125
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:17,280
years of people generously offering this um it really registers with a sense of

126
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:24,960
amazement and gratitude um and if we dedicate ourselves regularly to this practice we

127
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:32,040
start to feel the ways in which generosity grows um inside so for me

128
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:39,000
realizing that I'm coming up on the 20th year uh since I sat at Insight

129
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,520
Meditation Center um with Gil 20 years ago and have been doing so ever since

130
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:53,000
and now online the generosity of the people who developed these tools that enable us to come from all over the

131
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:00,760
world to gather and meditate together one way it manifests is is in an

132
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:08,520
attitude of goodwi towards others and I can see that going on in the chat um for

133
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:14,720
someone who's going through things and the care that people are sending that's pretty

134
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,640
wonderful so we can feel Goodwill towards each other and also towards experience

135
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,480
itself this practice makes us increasingly able to meet every kind of

136
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,960
experience and every kind of relationship with some Goodwill some

137
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,480
fundamental friendliness or kindness and willingness to open to what's happening

138
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:47,359
instead of being in conflict with it when that good will encounters

139
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:54,079
suffering we respond with another form of generosity and that is

140
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:02,119
compassion good willll wants to see suffering come to an end and it's an inclination of mind that

141
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:07,480
knows that given exactly the same conditions we would suffer in exactly

142
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,880
the same way and not only that when generosity

143
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:19,800
encounters someone who's experiencing Good Fortune instead of being envious or competitive the heart responds with

144
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:26,440
appreciative Joy feeling good for the other person um so devoted practice develops

145
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:33,920
this capacity not only to feel compassion to come from a quality of goodwi but also

146
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,040
to radiate good wishes towards someone for whom things are going

147
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,280
well and there are so many forms of generosity that surround

148
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:50,920
us um it it lightens the heart and it develops Good Will further Goodwill to

149
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:59,880
begin to look around you and discover generosity everywhere um Donna is the ancient poly

150
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:07,440
word for generosity and it's named as in the Buddhist text as the first of the 10

151
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,920
parmes or Perfections of virtue so the first Perfection of virtue is

152
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:22,319
generosity aan suito uh wrote a book about parmes that I'm sure many of you know and he in that

153
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:29,079
book he points out something pretty interesting that in order for our minds to be ready to take in the teachings of

154
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:38,440
the Buddha to really be ready for Liberation um the Mind needs preparation

155
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:44,920
and the specific preparation that aan suito sites is to

156
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:50,800
access and take in the validity the the real value of

157
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,680
generosity and also virtue and renunciation so these three together are

158
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:03,000
practiced as a beginning of being able to come to freedom from suffering

159
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,960
they're practiced not only for on but for the welfare of others and they're said to lead to

160
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,920
Peace So virtue and renunciation that are named in this Trio with

161
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:23,280
generosity to me actually come from generosity as well if you think about

162
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:30,040
practicing virtue which you could also say is ethical conduct or morality

163
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:37,920
that's another gift that we give each other that's the way we create safety

164
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,359
honesty trust and reliability in our

165
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:49,119
relationships and those things are so fun fundamental to Harmony and

166
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:56,920
ultimately happiness it brings peace to your own mind and BEC because the

167
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:04,960
conscience knows that it's behaving unethically and it will never come to peace when that's running under

168
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,400
conscious awareness it will continue to cause someone to act

169
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:18,920
out cause entire groups of people to act out in some form of discomfort

170
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,960
suffering although it it wears a lot of different

171
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:30,160
guises renunciation is a another Act of generosity when you think of letting go

172
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:36,480
of an UNH wholesome Habit in favor of a more wholesome way of being we are not

173
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,400
only benefiting ourselves but we're benefiting other people giving up on

174
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,599
wholesome Behavior UNH wholesome speech UNH wholesome thoughts we get a lot

175
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,560
easier to live around and we become less harmful to others so when we're

176
00:40:53,560 --> 00:41:00,280
practicing renunciation often we're giving up up our Greed for something that we previously craved as if it were

177
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:07,480
going to be the source of sustainable happiness and when we give up on that greed again we're doing something that

178
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,800
benefits others our cravings and

179
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:33,480
by using only what we need so as as you've been listening to

180
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:39,760
the various ways generosity presents itself in these foundations for the

181
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:47,200
practice of generosity virtue and um

182
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:54,240
renunciation as well as in the practice of mindfulness itself maybe some of the ways you experience generosity are

183
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:01,000
coming to mind um what are some of the simple ways that generosity shows up in

184
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,960
your practice in your life if you'd like I'd love it if you want to type some of them into the chat examples of

185
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,440
generosity that you value the generosity um of sharing it with each

186
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:20,760
other in the chat um will inspire others to see more forms of generosity in their

187
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,520
life so some of the things that are coming to mind for me are the uh really

188
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:34,400
kind way that when you're riding a bicycle uh cars will give you a wide birth as they pass or the

189
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,280
generosity of actually talking to someone who's a clerk at a store that

190
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:48,400
you're shopping in instead of just treating them anonymously so presence is one that I

191
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:56,800
see I see warm hugs being sent that's generosity what else inspires you

192
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,920
as generosity that you see in daily

193
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:10,240
life the kindness of strangers letting go of taking

194
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,760
