137
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:14,679
present in this guided meditation what would it be like what do you imagine how might shift your attitude towards

138
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:19,880
yourself towards others towards your life this this gift that is your life

139
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:25,679
your impermanent life or limited amount of time and we're always so uh concerned

140
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:34,080
with things that are not going well and and that that we miss we miss the grace of it as techan has said

141
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,320
um walking on water is not the miracle walking on

142
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:50,039
Earth is the miracle we're all engaging in Miracles every moment of being alive

143
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:55,080
so so the invitation for the small groups

144
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:00,919
is to again explore for your your own benefit as you speak You're exploring

145
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:06,639
the other two people are just holding you witness they're not going to ask you questions even if they didn't understand

146
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:13,760
a word of what you said they're just going to hold kind compassionate presence no questions asked you're just

147
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,000
exploring for your own benefit what would it be like I don't know um and

148
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,440
then you offer a nugget the next person offers a nugget or reflection reflecting for their own benefit the next person

149
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,840
then comes back to you so go around a few times doesn't have to be a long

150
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,440
monologue just one nugget of exploration uh offered for the benefit

151
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:44,120
of yourself and um yeah as a gift so so I'm going to

152
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,519
create the small groups and and yes let's go alphabetical order reverse

153
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:56,159
alphabetical order in terms uh with last name

154
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:03,960

155
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:11,360
care of each other be kind um yeah and explore what with this

156
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:18,440

161
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,399
large group um or you can also share it in chat either privately to me in which

162
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:56,720
case I won't read your name or you can share it with the whole group so what uh

163
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,600
what did you discover from this practice something shift and open up for

164
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,158
you I'd love to

165
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:20,159
hear and be quite a juicy practice and also can be confusing so everything is

166
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,960
welcome

167
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:42,120
there I'm GNA jump in because I love your topic um it's been sort of the

168
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:50,039
standard actually the standard of my life for a number of years because there was a movie done maybe as long as 10

169
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:58,159
years ago maybe longer called a bugs life and the songwriter for that movie

170
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,760
his name has unfortunately to gone out of my head in the middle of thinking about this tonight but he won an Oscar

171
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:10,760
for the first time he'd written scores of songs for movies never one anything

172
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:17,800
um and you would know all his songs he's very good anyway so he wrote a song for this movie called it's the rest of your

173
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,960
life so live it well this has been my Anthem ever since

174
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:29,480
I heard it because it is it's what we all it it would behoove us well to do

175
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,599
this let's put it that way um and I've always been one to look I I've had a

176
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:40,960
tough life and I've always looked at all the horrible things that have happened to me instead of looking at any of the

177
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,720
good things that came into my life uh and there were a lot of those too so I try to stay focused on the good things

178
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:53,440
coming in so that's why I gratitude on beautiful thank you Claire I have to go

179
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,480
find this this song now it's so sweet you love I'm going to go find it and I'm

180
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,920
sure by the time we finish the sentence you know who would have found it and put

181
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:10,000
the link in chat or something you know who but no pressure no

182
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,359
pressure great thanks Claire she lovely thank thank you for bringing this in

183
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:22,359
beautiful Petro please well thank you so much for this

184
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:30,760
practice was um yeah lovely and Powerful at the same time I was something I was sharing in the small group is um how

185
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,079
many moments in my life I live like they don't matter they're just a transition

186
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,359
to something else that will really matter and then when I get there it's just well that also doesn't matter as

187
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:48,320
much and there is the next thing coming up so lot of delusional moments uh but

188
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,400
this practice was very grounding to go back to yeah every moment matters so I

189
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:00,000
was so I really thank you for that lot of gratitude for that and I was also wondering is there any advice to bring

190
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,280
that more into maybe everyday life when we really get caught up in this Transitions and really forget about this

191
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,400
uh the preciousness of the moment of each moment yeah yeah thank you thanks

192
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:19,480
both for the reflection of how it it it really resonated for you and also the

193
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:27,280
question about how to live it remember to live it more um so so similar to

194
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,720
quote unquote mindfulness or or being aware it's it's easy to be mindful it's

195
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:40,760
and it's easy to forget right it's it's hard to remember it's easy to do it it's hard to forget so I mean h it's hard to

196
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,520
remember that's what I meant it's hard to so so that's why we practice that's why we practice on the cushion to bring

197
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:54,160
this reflection in so that it becomes more of an inclination of the mind and and also it would be helpful to have

198
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,319
some um um uh it's like habit stacking so you you

199
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:06,359
stack this reflection with especially those times that you tend to take them

200
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:14,240
for granted so maybe there are times that you're like oh I'm just going to go on I don't know social some social media

201
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:21,560
and it's just a wait time between whatever this and that it's like this doesn't matter like oh make a connection

202
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:27,720
to the times you go on a particular I don't know Facebook or whatever it is or this is the time like this matters this

203
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:33,880
moment of my life matters how can I really take care and again maybe it is appropriate to go on social media maybe

204
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,960
it is that is the appropriate thing to do in that moment if you connect but but be conscious of it so maybe connected

205
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:47,160
with with those moments that usually kind of um it it's as if it doesn't matter does

206
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:58,599
that make sense what I'm suggesting yeah yes yes connected yeah thank you thank you much thank you thank you and Peggy

207
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,480
um I it was kind of challenging for me I kept going back to um some part of my

208
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:11,200
past which um something today reminded me of I guess and kept trying to come

209
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,319
back to my breath and um and what does this mean and I finally came to well

210
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:21,440
these thoughts are here and um what if what if this mattered and I was here

211
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:29,160
with them which helped me bring more kindness to them which was much more helpful and the small group was really

212
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:36,119
nice just I heard some um commonalities that it was just so nice for me to feel

213
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:43,040
less alone with um some thought pattern that I have that's tremendous piggy I thank you

214
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:49,640
for your practice report I love how your heart and mind found a way to be with

215
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:57,280
what seemed to be challenging you know this pattern of you know something that has um been up for you they entanglement

216
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:04,040
you know thinking about something and then instead of beating yourself up okay how can I this matters what is going to

217
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:10,040
what does it teach me in this moment can I be with this with kindness what does this teach me right here this matters

218
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:16,200
this moment matters even this this rumination matters it's not like I need to push it away but how can I be with

219
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:21,400
this in a way that I learned so that's beautiful thanks Peggy thank you

220
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:27,000
Lely yeah Maran also says what Peggy just

221
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:34,440
report is pretty much exactly what my practice was like too yay that's sweet yeah that's great TK thank you Peggy

222
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:41,960
says here Fred hi uh for whatever reasons this

223
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:50,280
this didn't feel very difficult to do tonight and I'm aware that if I were to do it right now or tomorrow it might be

224
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:56,720
much harder so whatever the series of uh forces that brought it

225
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:04,119
to be a you know a kind of agreeable practice you know I'm thankful for them

226
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:10,560
but I recognized that it wasn't actually a big deal you know I I felt present of the moment it wasn't dramatic wasn't any

227
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,280
Revelation it was just being there and and that was fine that was and being

228
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:22,400
there is always so much better than not being there or you know struggling to be

229
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,359
there um and I just really appreciated the

230
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:35,599
lowkey what the low the lowkey pleasure is almost too strong a word but just the

231
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:42,280
um a little slow vibration of presence that that I got to enjoy beautiful thank

234
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:02,400

different ways as we find our way and and I appreciate what you shared in the way that yeah it was a low key um my

236
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:19,079

of ordinariness oh yeah this is beautiful delicious and and yes sometimes I can also if you do it again

238
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:31,359
maybe later at a different time cause a condition it'll feel extraordinary like wow the power of this move like or or
