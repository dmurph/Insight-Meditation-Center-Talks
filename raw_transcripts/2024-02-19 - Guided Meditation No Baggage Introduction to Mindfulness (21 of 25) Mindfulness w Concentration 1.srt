1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:08,480
so hello everyone and the

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:15,120
um I came today and the been away for a week and that technology here at IMC was

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:24,400
uh somehow a bit off and the final challenge was that uh the way that

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,240
I participate with all of you is through my laptop and um my laptop wasn't

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,640
connecting to the Wi-Fi here and so I don't know what uh but then I

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,200
didn't initially it was that uh it wasn't working at the recording station

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,719
but that seemed to have started to work so um now we're connected and I have a

8
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:58,920
different laptop so hopefully um it's all good sorry to be a little

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,719
late so

10
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,280
um so this is the fifth week of this introduction to meditation series that

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,680
I've been doing I'll me record so this is the fifth week of this

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,680
introduction to meditation series and I want to uh build on what

13
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,439
we've done so far uh this week or apply it in

14
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,920
different ways but one of the things I'd like to talk about today is the role of

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,960
concentration as a partner to mindfulness and I'll start with an

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:48,240
analogy and then we'll sit that um many years ago I went to Yus

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,960
with my family and small kids when they were

18
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,680
small and we stayed in tent cabins in the Yus Valley and then uh during the

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,920
day we did some uh beautiful hikes but some of them were quite Steep

20
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,920
and uh had to keep these little kids kind of entertained as we went along and

21
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,280
we had brought with us uh you know luggage of different types that we could carry from the car to the

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:25,160
tents if I had decided to uh bring all my luggage with us on our hikes into the

23
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,280
mountains carrying the suitcases and the backpacks and sleeping bags and everything that we

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,599
had um we wouldn't have gotten very far it would have been quite

25
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:42,400
exhausting so the same thing with meditation sometimes we carry with us into

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,879
meditation um so much of the baggage so much of the memories

27
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:55,159
expectations projections into the future fantasies we carry it along and um we

28
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:00,400
can't go very far if we're carrying a lot of baggage with us

29
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:09,280
the role of concentration is to put down some of that baggage and uh and

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:17,159
um uh even if it's just briefly so um uh we can be

31
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:24,120
mindful and the mindfulness can be continuous part of the function of

32
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,640
concentration is for the mindfulness to stay put for a while so that can hike

33
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,400
along in our life without carrying a lot of baggage picking up a lot of things along the

34
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,599
way the role of what's called concentration is not just to be

35
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,760
continuous but to be immersed in what we're being mindful of a certain kind of

36
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:55,439
immersion into so we can be present in a fuller maybe embodied way so with that

37
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,799
as a introduction we'll meditate

38
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,920
and so to assume a meditation posture and part of the idea of an

39
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,120
intentional meditation posture is to a posture which

40
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,959
allows some of the luggage We Carry in Our Lives to slide

41
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:26,880
off and maybe what slides off is what first is what is least needed for

42
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,680
meditation so take an intentional medit meditative posture where your whole

43
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:39,320
body recognizes oh here we go with meditation the longer you meditate the

44
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:45,560
more there's an embodied recognition this is time for

45
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,960
meditation and then close your eyes and

46
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,840
gently uh take the three breath Journey count each breath to three

47
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,120
staying present for the

48
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:33,400
breath and then let's do that again this time if you to really stay connected to

49
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,520
the breathing continuously or

50
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:47,720
immersively if you count to three count one for the inhale and one for the

51
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,759
exhale then two two 3 three but do it so

52
00:05:52,759 --> 00:06:00,080
that the count somehow gently quietly almost like a whisper in the mind kind

53
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:07,639
of is really feels the inhale feels the exhale or maybe you gently repeat it

54
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,440
couple of times through the inhale and exhale so the

55
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:20,080
count really helps you to be immersed in the experience of each inhale and each

56
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,039
exhale so do a three breath

57
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Journey

58
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,680
of course you many of you all have

59
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,400
different speed by which those three breaths are done you can always do more

60
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,560
so now taking a few long slow breaths

61
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,280
relaxing on the exhale kind of staying with a whole

62
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,879
exhale as you

63
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:31,000
exhale the relaxing with the exhale is an immersion into your bily experience

64
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,720
an immersion in

65
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
exhaling

66
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,240
for and then letting your breathing return

67
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,479
to

68
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,959
normal and

69
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:54,480
now take a five breath Journey count up to

70
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,640
five to each count this twice once for the inhale one for the

71
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:08,320
exhale and you can see if you can count as soft as you need to so that it's not

72
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,920
agitating to count or seems like too much work even if you imagine your

73
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,680
counting is enough and count up to five with the

74
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:28,800
idea that the count is encouraging the mindfulness to stay immersed in the

75
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:35,200
discovery of what the breath is like the experience or

76
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:42,800
breathing not straining but relaxing into the full experience of

77
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,600
breathing in and out so there's a continuity for five

78
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,680
breaths without carrying luggage with

79
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,279
you and then continue through the sitting if you loose count just start

80
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:06,800
over again at one if five is too much go back to

81
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:14,040
three or if you make it want to make it really simple count up to one and then start

82
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,399
over

83
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
again

84
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
e

85
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
for

86
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
for

87
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
for

88
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
for

89
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
e

90
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
e

91
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

92
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:52,000
as you count your breaths you might think of the count

93
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:00,399
each count as a invitation to

94
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,970
relax open and feel

95
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:14,279
[Music] receive the experience of

96
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,800
breathing maybe almost as

97
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,600
if you're receiving

98
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:37,439
A Gentle Wind that surrounds you fills

99
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,680
you staying with a

100
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,560
breath carrying no luggage nothing with

101
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:05,279
you open-handed open-minded openhearted to just this experience of

102
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
breathing

103
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

104
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
e

105
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
e

106
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
for

107
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

108
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
e

109
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

110
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
e

111
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
e

112
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

113
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

114
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
e

115
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:12,960
and then for a few more breaths see if you can give yourself

116
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,559
over to a to an attention an immersive

117
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:26,880
attention with no baggage to just

118
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,279
breathing with an equal immersion in the inhale as

119
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:39,399
the exhale with no

120
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,960
strain maybe as if immersing yourself in the body's

121
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,480
experience of breathing it's like lowering yourself into a refreshing

122
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,799
or warm pool of

123
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:13,520
water safely immersed in the pool or the

124
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:33,080
bathtub and as you would feel the water against your skin feel the sensations the waves of

125
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:40,360
breathing in the inside of your skin inside your

126
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
body

127
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,679
and then [Music]

128
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,679
to in this

129
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:22,840
meditation relax let go of breathing just be here

130
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:31,200
for a few seconds nothing to do nothing to be nowhere to

131
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:38,559
go just sit here open and present and simplest way

132
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:55,880
possible and then without picking up baggage and histories

133
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:03,320
and fears open your attention your

134
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,640
concern to the people around you in your

135
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:15,159
communities households work wherever you might be

136
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:21,000
today and imagine meeting people without any

137
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:29,640
baggage without any predetermination ideas or judgments

138
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:37,000
or history that for a few moments you meet them

139
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,398
fresh and in that

140
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,960
freshness with Good Will wishing them

141
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:10,200
well may the people in my life today May my good

142
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:17,919
will spread to them may my care for their

143
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:27,039
well-being be directed towards them may whatever ability I have to be a

144
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:34,200
safe person person for them may that come forward as

145
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,960
I put down

146
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,919
Luggage in whatever way that I accept them so they can be

147
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:53,799
themselves free to make their own choices may I accept

148
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:04,600
them may the meditation practice we do serve

149
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,960
us in one way or the other to

150
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,640
benefit the world around

151
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
us

152
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
for

153
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:37,000
so good morning on this Monday morning or good day for those of you it's

154
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,360
already the morning's already gone by and

155
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:48,919
um so this is the fifth week of this introduction to mindfulness

156
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:54,799
meditation and um the general idea of mindfulness is

157
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,360
very simple and I think maybe the very beginning of this series I try to offer

158
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:07,120
the Simplicity of it and the instructions that I've given since then might seem like it makes it

159
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:14,559
complicated but it's more like uh describing the territory of what we could experience if

160
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:21,279
we're available and open to the present moment and the idea is to be present

161
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,880
simply for that don't have to make it complicated don't have to do a lot of things except

162
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:34,919
to be present but we know what to be present for so we began with breathing being

163
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:40,440
present for breathing that's stabilizing it's connecting it's Wonder for many

164
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:46,120
people a wonderful beginning for some people it's not and then there are other

165
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:51,720
uh home bases for attention but uh generally the way we teach in a generic

166
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:57,799
way is to um have breathing be the home base

167
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:05,279
and then as we go along the body speaks up and the body becomes more you know

168
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:11,440
speaks up and wants to be heard and uh and so then we can let go

169
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,639
of breathing and then we the very simple attention to recognize and feel what's

170
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:26,399
happening is uh with the experience of the body and uh as we go along there might

171
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:33,000
be emotion that arise and those emotions we can feel in the body are expressed in

172
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,159
the body and emotions can be listened to can be heard can be attended to again

173
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:45,399
with a very simple attention it's very caring profoundly

174
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:52,279
meaningful for our emotional life for the emotions to have room to be without

175
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:59,279
us involving ourselves with them for or against them but they to keep it really

176
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:06,000
simple and then we some point we become aware of thinking and the idea is to keep that

177
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,399
simple simple recognition as we're recognizing these things simplic very simply then we since

178
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:19,760
we know the territory we might kind of see different aspects of each one we

179
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,919
might see the particular sensations of the body we might see the way the

180
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:32,399
sensations in the body where the emotions are most active and most Express themselves we might

181
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:37,559
see that the emotions are made up of different parts and so to be aware of

182
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:44,519
these different component parts because we kind of have a sense of the map so it's not like we have to go searching or

183
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:49,760
figuring it out but we just over time we know more and more of the territory and

184
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:57,360
we can just bring simple awareness oh this is how it is this is how it is and some people find it very helpful to have

185
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:04,000
some phrase like uh something like uh this is how it is

186
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,480
now or this is X now this is this is how it is at the

187
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:19,760
moment uh just leave it that simple so the general way we teach is to

188
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,880
have the breathing at the center something else becomes more

189
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,840
predominant attend to it be present for it receive it allow for

190
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:37,880
it to be enter into awareness when it no longer feels like it needs to be attended to then go back to the

191
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,639
breathing go to the next thing that comes up back to the breathing and so that's kind of the breathing is the

192
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:49,919
place to come back to and one of the reasons for that is for some people many people not

193
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,639
everyone um breathing uh having one place that's the place for stability the

194
00:33:55,639 --> 00:34:01,200
place for the default to come back back to helps to develop continuity there and

195
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:08,398
the rhythm of breathing is a place that's continuous it's always there gently rocking us massaging us being

196
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,638
present here for us and so what we're what we're doing then is we're also

197
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,679
bringing along um uh ability to stay with something

198
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:25,760
continuously uh sometimes that's called concentration though some people associate concentration with straining

199
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,720
or narrowing down and a laser focus or something it's more an experience of

200
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:40,760
immersion with the experience and uh or uh uh uh composing

201
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:47,800
ourselves on the experience just really being here for this and um and the value

202
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:55,320
of this is that if we don't have a home base like this if we're not cult cultivating concentration with the

203
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,839
mindfulness that um uh our

204
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:07,160
mind has its own interests and if we're just simply being a available to notice

205
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:14,400
what's happening in the mind what's happening what's sometimes what we're doing is not necessar is the mind not

206
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,880
might not have the be your best interest in mind and you might not see how

207
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:26,440
subconsciously there's bias towards certain directions certain concerns certain emphasises like some people are

208
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,560
really almost addicted to their thinking and so just to constantly be mindful of

209
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:37,480
thinking thinking thinking actually strengthens the thinking reinforces it some

210
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:45,760
people prioritize their emotions and uh and there's a way in which uh uh uh we

211
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:53,720
we're predisposed to experience the emotion more than is necessary and so uh our attention is

212
00:35:53,720 --> 00:36:00,160
often not unbiased but represents some of the deep deeper um attachments deeper

213
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:07,119
fears deeper concerns that uh we bring with us and so uh the idea of staying

214
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,520
with something like breathing as continuously we can is the equivalent to

215
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:19,119
um not uh going hiking uh in the mountains with all your luggage that's

216
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:26,760
really hard if and you can't go very far and you might get to understand how the weight of your luggage and the and the

217
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,000
and what it feels like in your hand to grip the handles of the luggage you might get to know those things really

218
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,040
well but you're still not going to go into the mountains very far and so the idea is to be able to put down the

219
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,800
baggage that we carry with us the the bias we carry with us the the uh the the

220
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,079
orientations that we have that don't really serve Us in order to kind of be

221
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:57,280
become fresher and be able to go deeper and look more without bias without

222
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,560
pre-existing orientation and baggage and so uh something like the

223
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,680
breathing to develop some modum of concentration don't have a high

224
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,960
standard um and so uh even being able to stay with three breaths

225
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:23,280
continuously um or even sometimes even just one breath continuously is enough to begin to um um

226
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:29,720
interrupt the way in which we feed thinking or feed our emotional life or

227
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:36,280
feed some concern that we have and beginning to take this think of

228
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:43,119
attention as food and whatever Direction attention is going we're feeding that

229
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:49,760
thing and if attention is going towards being mindful being aware of

230
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:56,240
thinking then the attention goes to the mindfulness but if attention goes into

231
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,480
thinking then we're feeding the thinking if attention goes into emotions there's a

232
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,800
way in which we feed them but if attention goes into being aware being

233
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,440
mindful of emotions it's kind of like we step back and really see it oh the not

234
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:21,040
to condemn it not to push it away but not so we're with the experience but

235
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:27,520
we're not we're not we're not identified with the experience we're not being the exper

236
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:35,720
experience and um every experience is allowed to be what it is but we don't have to be identified with it we defined

237
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:42,480
by it be in it so this uh continuity just one breath

238
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:50,200
is enough to step away and from the uh put down the baggage two breaths three

239
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:56,119
breaths and to have not try too much because the idea is to let that slowly

240
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:01,440
grow continuity immersion concentration is something

241
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,480
that's um it's like a muscle that develops it or it's like a um uh like a

242
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:16,040
muscle that we're relaxing but just gently massaging it over and over again and slowly something develops or it's

243
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:21,240
like butter if you take butter out of the freezer um it's really hard and you

244
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:27,560
can't uh you know you have to break it in order to to U Break It in half you

245
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:35,160
have to kind of you know take a hammer to it or something but if you let the butter sit out in in the

246
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:42,040
warmth of the room slowly it will uh it'll get softer until you just take can

247
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:49,119
take a butter knife and just almost even just put it on top and it just sinks right through easily so the same way

248
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,680
with concentration it's it's a slow warming up process we come back and stay

249
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:00,280
with a few breaths and and then if we're not upset that we get distracted but

250
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:06,680
lovingly Begin Again Begin Again and something begins to come into the groove

251
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:13,720
and maybe we get five breaths maybe 10 breaths as an act of will we could stay

252
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:19,200
for 10 breaths maybe but concentration is not meant to be an act of

253
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,319
will um uh it's meant to be a a Act of

254
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:33,440
love an act of care an act of of um of uh offering our presence to

255
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,960
something and that's with a combination the coming together of mindfulness and

256
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,040
concentration of mindfulness with a continuity of mindfulness we're mindful

257
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:50,040
of something and then we stay with it for a while feel it be with it and if

258
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:57,000
it's not something other than breathing like if it's some sensation in the body or some emotion or thinking

259
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,359
um this idea of a you spend at least three breaths with each one oh maybe

260
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,839
three breaths is enough to fully acknowledge something and the acknowledging and being and feeling it

261
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:14,359
for a little bit for three breaths I'd be enough to be able to put it aside and come back to the

262
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:20,040
breathing and um and so this rhythm of three breaths with whatever we recognize

263
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:25,960
in be with sometimes we want to be longer with something that's fine but uh

264
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:31,079
it's great sometimes to just stay for a long time with one thing but the three

265
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:38,119
breaths putting down the baggage just being with that uh can begin

266
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:43,720
to overcome and relax

267
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:49,680
the the bias automatic Pilots the automatic

268
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,920
prioritization that the Mind makes for what's where attention goes what we're

269
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:00,920
concerned with for for example with our thinking so I hope that that makes sense

270
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:08,400
and um and so I want to leave you with the the principle that uh the way

271
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,920
that I teach mindfulness is with a um partnership

272
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:20,200
with concentration and the two don't have to be uh done separately but one

273
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:27,520
supports the other so thank you and um continue this

274
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,760
introductory series

275
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,400
tomorrow
