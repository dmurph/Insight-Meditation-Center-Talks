00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:07,000
good evening good evening it's a pleasure to be here with

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,519
you all this evening or maybe it's not evening where you are maybe you're listening to this or

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:23,000
watching this sometime later whenever it might be welcome

4
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:33,560
welcome so we'll just do a little bit lightly guided guided

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,839
meditation taking our meditation

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,120
posture a posture that

7
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:57,640
reflects Our intention of settling

8
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:06,519
in and being up ight these two different

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,280
movements be finding a balance

10
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:27,798
between some ease and some comfort and some alertness

11
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:39,040
maybe there's some wiggling that happens as we find our

12
00:01:52,079 --> 00:02:00,240
seat and just allowing the mind and the body

13
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,240
to arrive here the body is here

14
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,679
but sometimes the mind is

15
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:24,080
elsewhere it can be helpful to feel

16
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,800
connected to this experience

17
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,400
feeling the pressure of the cushion or chair

18
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:47,319
bench couch bed against the body

19
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:12,239
and feeling any uprightness that is if you're in a

20
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:20,680
meditation posture feeling the pressure of the chair cushion but also the spine

21
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,120
being upright the head being over the

22
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,120
shoulders

23
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:01,720
we might notice that the body is breathing

24
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,280
there's a certain

25
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,040
Rhythm to the movement of the chest or the

26
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,560
belly certain Rhythm to the air going in and out of

27
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,759
the nose

28
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:56,759
what is it like to connect with that

29
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:04,039
Rhythm the expansion over the chest or belly

30
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:12,160
and and then the whatever is the opposite of expansion the shrinking

31
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,160
the

32
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,719
nonexpansion stretching and then the non

33
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,680
stretching for

34
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:16,639
we might notice that the breath is long and

35
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:24,080
slow or maybe it's a little bit fast and

36
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,560
shorter maybe deep or shallow

37
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,479
we're just

38
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:01,400
noticing can we trust that the body knows how to breathe

39
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,199
we don't have to do anything

40
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,520
special e

41
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,680
and when the mind wanders as it will

42
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:42,399
do we don't have to make it a problem just very

43
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,200
simply gently begin

44
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,320
again can we begin again with

45
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,440
a environment of warmth and

46
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,440
care e

47
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:46,800
rather than meditation being one more place where

48
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,880
the inner critic might pester us

49
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,000
can we have

50
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:12,360
meditation be a place of safety Sanctuary for our mind and

51
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:21,320
hearts a refuge for our mind and hearts

52
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:57,639
a refuge that allows what our experience

53
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:01,240
is to be there

54
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,120
without insisting that it be

55
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:32,279
different a refuge that has warmth and

56
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
care e

57
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:55,839
a refuge that treats us with

58
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:02,560
respect and honor honors the

59
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120

e e

86
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,159
what is it like to

87
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:20,080
meditate in such a way that it feels like a

88
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:29,440
refuge a sanctuary a place of safety

89
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:36,360
allowing the mind and the heart and the

90
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,720
body to

91
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:47,840
rest and to feel safe

92
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:12,158
is there a way that we can practice that we can

93
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,278
meditate that supports us

94
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:29,640
and allows not only for us to feel this sense of Refuge Refuge creating a refuge

95
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:37,000
a place of safety but also for that to affect the

96
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,640
way we show up for others affect the way that we

97
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:49,919
behave things that we say in

98
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:58,679
communities that is to help them feel safe help them

99
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:07,320
feel like there's a refuge so that our

100
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,120
practice isn't only for

101
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,760
ourselves but it's for those we come in contact

102
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,880
with and perhaps even those who come in contact with those who come in contact

103
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:34,559
with us and this way we can extend

104
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:41,039
or expand the sense of ease that comes when

105
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,240
there's a sense of safety and

106
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,240
refuge so that our practice may be for the benefit of all

107
00:29:52,240 --> 00:30:01,039
beings everywhere for

108
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:09,940
[Music]

109
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:55,279
so welcome welcome a really warm welcome to

110
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,799
everybody wherever you might

111
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:06,880
be and whatever situation you might find yourself in as you're listening to this

112
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,639
or watching it as the case may

113
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:20,120
be so want to mention that a book just came out just got published called be

114
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:27,919
the Refuge the subtitle raising the voices of Asian-American Buddhists it's written

115
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:37,200
written by the amazingly talented chenz Han and I know chenz and I know a lot of

116
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,000
work went into writing this book and pulling it all

117
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,639
together and on Sunday afternoon February 28th IMC is sponsoring an event

118
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:56,240
to discuss the book so everybody's invited to that and this book is a part

119
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,360
Memoir from trans as well as it's a result of her Research

120
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:08,120
into the experience of Asian-American Buddhists and it's quite

121
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:14,960
touching so I can recommend this book and of course with a title of be

122
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:23,080
the Refuge um she discusses this or you know in this in the book and without giving

123
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:30,200
away the details of the book I'll say that a person in the

124
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:38,960
book um describes how they were to turn their practice toward being a refuge for

125
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,240
others there such a beautiful idea I think this it's kind of this act of

126
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:52,120
generosity this act of recognizing the impact that we have on

127
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:59,360
others and this wish to be a refuge for others and some ways maybe that kind of

128
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:05,159
uh summarizes the Buddhist practice is to find a way in which we

129
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:13,399
can be a support for everybody in some kind of way but in the book this uh individual

130
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:19,960
talks about creating a space where people feel calm and

131
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:26,159
positive in a way that they are taking care of each other rather than creating

132
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,600
agitation sometimes there's this um bonding

133
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:38,240
through mutual outrage I think uh Kim Allen I heard her say that and I

134
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,480
recognize that there certainly have been times in my life when you know my

135
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:50,360
friends were like yeah and can you believe this also and that oh my gosh and not only that this and then we just

136
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:58,880
kind of rattle ourselves up more and more but what is it to create a space

137
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:06,399
where people feel calm and positive not by being ply Anna not by denying what's

138
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:13,040
happening but to recognize that tremendous value is there by not

139
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:20,638
creating conditions that makes people more agitated or more feeling ill at ease or

140
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,079
more worried or anxious or whatever it might

141
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,919
be but to be refuge in a way that to create a space either literal or

142
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:38,000
metaphorically create a space where people can feel some well-being some

143
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,358
calm and positivity and then in in chenine

144
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:51,679
book this individual also talks about one way to be a refuge is to create

145
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:59,119
communities that are refuges for others where people can find comfort and

146
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:06,640
well-being and sometimes that's through Affinity groups people coming together that maybe

147
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:14,359
look similar or have similar beliefs or have similar background similar

148
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:20,800
ethnicities similar experiences similar preferences whatever

149
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,880
it might be similar ages so Affinity

150
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:33,720
groups is one way we can help create a a refuge to help be a refuge is to either

151
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:41,480
create uh communities that perhaps don't exist or if they do exist to show up in a way and that we can convert them into

152
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:48,560
a place that is a refuge and of course it's not only Affinity groups there's all kinds of

153
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:54,359
kalanam groups good spiritual friends and people

154
00:35:54,359 --> 00:36:01,760
that live in this similar geographical area that before covid

155
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:08,359
would meet in person to talk about the drama I'm imagining many of them are

156
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:14,480
meeting online now and for some of these programs we

157
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,599
have at IMC we kind of try to facilitate a little

158
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:27,640
bit uh the creation of Home groups which are kind of like this kalana groups these ideas small community where people

159
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:34,078
can practice together and discuss and explore different

160
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:40,599
topics and of course there's even these uh when we're on the zoom meetings I

161
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:46,319
know for some teachings that we do here at IMC with some of the programs that

162
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:51,880
are on Zoom we break people up into breakout groups you know maybe two three

163
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:59,000
four five six people and those of course are also kind of a little bit of a community

164
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,920
and what would it be like if we had this idea that kind of to be a refuge is to

165
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:10,520
help create a community wherever we might find ourselves where people can

166
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,640
feel safe they can feel some comfort and some

167
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:24,800
ease for us to have this movement of the heart to be inclusive and to be generous

168
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,520
with our attention and our time

169
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:36,079
so trening Han she describes this in her book uh be the Refuge raising the voices

170
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:43,000
of Asian-American Buddhists there's all kinds of great stuff in that book that's but also we can look to see what do the

171
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:50,920
suas have to say what does it mean to be a refuge for others we often associate

172
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:56,200
this word refuge with taking Refuge take refuge in the Buddha Dharma

173
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,319
the SAA not so much this idea of be a

174
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:07,960
refuge and there's a suta that's uh in the poly Canon and it has a parallel

175
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:13,119
that was also preserved in

176
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:19,839
Chinese and uh it talks about this idea of being a refuge and as is often the

177
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:26,160
case or maybe even always the case that when there's a sua that's in the poly Canon and there's a parallel that's got

178
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:34,720
preserved in Chinese that there's differences between them and so I'll be focusing on what the

179
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,720
part that's the same uh between these two

180
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:47,520
sutas so in this suta the Buddha says to a

181
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:56,560
Brahman it is here Brahman that you should bathe to make yourself a refuge for all

182
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:05,480
beings it is here Brahman that you should bathe to make yourself a refuge for all

183
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,920
beings so maybe we can unpack this a little bit what is the Buddha talking

184
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:18,640
about about bathing and making on a refuge so maybe I'll um start by saying

185
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,359
this expression make yourself a refuge if um we look at the poly I can't read

186
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:32,520
Chinese so I not sure exactly what it says in the Chinese but uh if I look at the ply the translation maybe more

187
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:41,200
literally would be make yourself a place of safety or make yourself make a a

188
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:49,319
sanctuary or something like that it's not the same word refuge sa that we um

189
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:56,200
when we take refuge in the Buddha Dharma Sanga but uh a number of English translators have used this word refuge

190
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:02,440
and I rather like it so this idea

191
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,880
of making yourself a refuge for all

192
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,359
beings so this idea of bathing comes from the context of the

193
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:19,280
suta as you might imagine so in the suta the Buddha is with some monastics and he

194
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,280
sees in the distance that there's a Brahman so a Brahman at this time and in

195
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:32,160
this setting and this is um we could think of as a priest for the dominant

196
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:38,200
religious Tradition at that time in Ancient India so somebody who was a not

197
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:44,960
only a practitioner but somebody who was um an upholder maybe we could say of the

198
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:51,119
tradition of the dominant religious Tradition at that time which we might call

199
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:59,000
brahmanism and so the Buddha is with uh some monastics and he sees this Brahman

200
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,960
in the distance that's um approaching him and knowing that the Brahman will

201
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,040
over hear what the Buddha is about to say the Buddha begins his talk uh

202
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:18,040
directed to his monastics but also kind of directed towards this Brahman and he

203
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:25,079
says that there are these six different types of impurities or

204
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:30,560
defilements in the mind we can think of this impurities or

205
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:37,359
defilements we could think of this as um one way that I is a I find helpful to

206
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:43,760
think about that are things that are extra like we don't need them they're

207
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,119
not helpful and so for me that's one way I like to think about it defilement and

208
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,640
impurity sometimes has this feeling of this

209
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,880
puritanical uh way uptightness or something like that to some of the

210
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,040
associations we might have with these words I don't know if that was the

211
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,280
associations that were um with these words in Ancient India but I like this

212
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,359
idea of things that are extra and that we don't need

213
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:23,000
them and that budha gives these 16 I'll go through this list don't worry

214
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:30,440
I'm not going to unpack them all or anything like this but just to give you a sense what are these uh this

215
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:39,839
list covetousness and unrighteous greed it will anger resentment offensiveness

216
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:45,000
contempt Envy stinginess deceit fraud

217
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:52,760
obstinacy aggression conceit arrogance vanity and

218
00:42:53,480 --> 00:43:02,200
negligence so we might um summarize perhaps this uh list of 16 as

219
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:07,960
maybe greediness of self selfishness or I want more or I need

220
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:15,040
more or maybe it's aversion of will hostility kind of like get away from me

221
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:23,160
or get this away from me or maybe also um this self assertion or a conceit we

222
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:29,599
might also think of it like don't you know who I am kind of thinking and I would say with the exception maybe

223
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:36,520
it's that last one negligence negligence is just maybe not to applying ourselves

224
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:43,400
or not being careful or attentive or something like this so maybe the first

225
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,800
15 we might summarize and you might recognize this

226
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:56,359
idea of I want more I need more or get this away from me or don't you know who

227
00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:04,280
I am and these are manifestations of greed hatred and delusion some of the core

228
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:10,559
foundational defilement but the way that um the

229
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:17,119
Buddha is using these the words that he's using right he's not talking about you know just the core fundamental ones

230
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:23,359
with uh some of these words of aggression or stinginess or Envy or

231
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:29,160
arrogance vanity using some of these words there are some of the ones that

232
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,880
are um maybe we might think well these are just minor

233
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:43,400
manifestations of some of these deeper things that are extra defilements

234
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:54,000
impurities but um I appreciate what neopan Tera who is a who was a an elder

235
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,040
in this tradition like his book The Heart of buddh meditation was one of the first and pretty foundational books

236
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:07,720
written in English came out in the mid-60s about uh theas

237
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:13,720
practice and uh he writes how much more pleasant and

238
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:20,680
harmonious will be human relations individual and communal if there is less

239
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:27,359
pettiness and peevishness and fewer vanities and jealousies and less self

240
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:34,960
assertiveness and words and deeds so that was kind of one his way when he looked at this list of 16 thinking like

241
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:41,240
it would just be so much easier to get along with other people whether it's just one other

242
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:47,359
people or whether we're in a group if there was less of these things these um

243
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:55,079
16 different qualities and we also might consider that there is a connection between these

244
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:00,280
qualities and the deeper roots of greed hatred and

245
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:05,400
delusion and so to work with where they show up and maybe what we might

246
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:12,359
consider minor or we might consider surface level to work with them and how

247
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:19,040
they get expressed in our daily lives is really a way in which to work with the

248
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:24,960
the deeper ones the the foundational the root

249
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,680
defilements so then the Buddha in the suta he can he can um he continues after

250
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:37,319
talking about this list of 16 defilements he says if you know it's a

251
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:45,359
defilement abandon it seem so straightforward right makes

252
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:50,920
it sound easy of course it's not easy but this is why we have a meditation

253
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:57,240
practice and why we have a Buddhist practice not just meditation but all of them all of the elements of the eight

254
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:03,559
path or the gradual training that is to recognize if you

255
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:08,880
know it's a defilement if you know that this is something that's extra that's

256
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,920
not helpful that doesn't lead to Greater freedom but instead leads to less

257
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:21,800
freedom and to some suffering abandon it so what are some ways in which we can

258
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:27,079
lessen the attachment the clinging the stickiness

259
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:34,040
some of these uh expressions of the of greed hatred and

260
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:41,160
delusion so if you know it's a defilement sometimes we don't know sometimes these are a habits of

261
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:47,240
mind sometimes we're so used to thinking well of course

262
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:53,880
I'm filled with arrogance because everybody else is an idiot what do they

263
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,960
know or I don't know maybe that's an exaggeration but are there some ways

264
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:07,319
that maybe we weren't quite considering that they were impediments to Greater freedom and

265
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:14,040
greater ease and then the Buddha and the suta

266
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:20,040
continues and he goes with a describing Brahma vajar

267
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:27,240
practice probably many of you if not all of you are familiar with this practice it

268
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:34,440
begins with imbuing the mind with loving kindness this is good will

269
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:40,040
respect benevolence care friendliness

270
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:45,119
love for others and oneself not just others and

271
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:52,079
oneself and the way love and kindness practice is described in the sutas which is a little bit different than how we

272
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:58,599
practice it like when I do happy hour um to um relying more on the way loving

273
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:03,839
kindness practice is described in the commentary so a little bit um after the

274
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:10,880
time of the suit does but in the suit does is to imbue the mind with loving kindness this

275
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,319
warm-heartedness if you will and then to pervade it in 10

276
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:22,720
directions four directions we can think of as the Cardinal north south east

277
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:29,240
west and then four directions are the intermediate H Northwest Southwest

278
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:37,480
northeast southeast and then the two directions above and below all

279
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:45,359
directions so to imbue the mind with loving kindness and then pervade 10

280
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:50,440
directions with this warm-heartedness and then with a mind

281
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:57,480
that is boundless exalted immeasurable and welldeveloped

282
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:04,400
and find myself smiling when I'm talking about this because sometimes right if we have this

283
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:12,160
loving kindness practice and we're able to really feel fill the heart and mind

284
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:18,760
with this Good Will and to be sending it out and

285
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:24,960
including ourselves with it it is such a way in which we can have

286
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,359
in which we are not expressing a aggression or stinginess or deceit or

287
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:36,559
contempt or resentment all these other things that are in this list of

288
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:44,920
16 so in the suta it's not clear if the Buddha is um saying first abandon these

289
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:50,400
16 defilements and then practice the Brahma aaras or it's and practice the

290
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,640
Brahma vajar or maybe we might even understand it that practicing the Brahma

291
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:03,838
vajar is a way in which we can help us to abandon some of these 16

292
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:11,040
qualities so many of you know where the Brahma vhar is I um first started talking about loving

293
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:17,559
kindness but it also includes compassion sympathetic joy and

294
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:25,040
equinity there say four movements of the heart um we might say so I won't go into

295
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:32,799
detail about what that is but but this just a recognition that it's a sense in

296
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:40,359
which there's um maybe a sense of fullness or a sense of um maybe some

297
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:44,960
safety and some that itself can be a

298
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:53,680
refuge so then this uh then the Buddha and the Brahman start discussing

299
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:59,520
bathing and purification so the Buddha

300
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,000
says Brahman so now he's directing his attention to the Brahman Maybe by this

301
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:11,520
time the Brahman has walked there and has sat down that's not explicit but that's what's happening in my mind is

302
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:17,079
that now the Brahman is sitting with the monastics and is listening to what the

303
00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:23,079
Buddha has to say and the Buddha says Brahman this is what is called bathing

304
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:30,359
the inner mind instead of bathing the outer body so the Buddha is making a

305
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:38,760
real distinction to purify cleanse remove what's extra from the

306
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:45,119
mind making that's really different than purifying cleansing removing what's

307
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:51,760
extra on the body external body and the B the Brahman replies by

308
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:58,799
saying Goa you should go to the bahooka river to bathe cuz one who bathes in the

309
00:52:58,799 --> 00:53:04,119
bahooka river becomes purified and eliminates all

310
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:09,200
evil so we can we learn that this Brahman was a person who their practice

311
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,440
their spiritual practice was to bathe in particular rivers and sacred rivers with

312
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:20,920
the belief that that didn't matter so much what actions you did as long as you

313
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:30,880
included the action of bathing in the river and then all you all the bad or

314
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:37,720
inappropriate unskillful UNH wholesome everything that you had done would just be washed

315
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:45,760
away then maybe as a as a little aside I'll say there's a another suta it's um

316
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:51,680
from the terata some of you might be familiar this is the verses from the

317
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:57,400
nuns and there's um some there's a nun

318
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:03,599
right now her Name Escapes me I think it's Puna who um also encounters a Brahman

319
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:09,079
who has this uh practice that um just um

320
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:16,040
as long as you bathe in the right Rivers you can do whatever you want and I'm I'm chuckling because uh

321
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:23,000
the nun says to the Brahman something like this I'm paraphrasing well if that were true then wouldn't all the turtles

322
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,880
and the fish and I think COC crocodiles and serpents wouldn't they all be

323
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:36,160
perfectly pure and if that were true wouldn't all your good deeds also be

324
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:43,760
washed away so I appreciate very much that this nun doesn't just speaking truth to power

325
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:50,760
here this Brahman but getting back to this suta where um the Buddha is uh speaking to

326
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:56,839
this Brahman about there's to do this inner cleansing this inner

327
00:54:56,839 --> 00:55:05,400
bathing if you will rather than outer and then the Buddha um says to

328
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:11,839
inverse for the pure in heart and I looked at the ply it's is this word is

329
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:18,079
heart as opposed to mind which is um I don't know it's a

330
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:24,720
beautiful thing actually to think about having this pure of heart maybe with the loving kindness

331
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:30,799
practice is a way that helps us to have this purity of heart or the Brahma vajar

332
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:36,480
practice for the pure in heart it's always the spring festival or the

333
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:42,799
Sabbath so the Buddha is saying we don't have to wait for special days that we go

334
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:49,640
bathe in the river to be cleansed of things that um wrongdoing if we are pure

335
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:55,880
of heart then every day is a special day for the pure in heart and clean of

336
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:02,559
deed their vows will always be fulfilled we don't have to go bathe in

337
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:09,920
the river and then the Buddha says it is here Brahman that you should bathe to

338
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:17,960
make yourself a refuge for all beings it is here that is abandoning

339
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:23,280
those defilements and practicing loving kindness which maybe isn't a surprise

340
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:30,480
for any of us the part of the Buddhist practice is these two movements of the heart two

341
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:39,039
movements of the mind that allow us to show up for others to create safety for

342
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:45,680
others to be a sanctuary for others it also points to this idea that

343
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:53,920
behaving ethically is much more than just following the precepts but also to notice any contempt

344
00:56:53,920 --> 00:57:01,280
or domineering or ER arrogance that we might have and for us to think about that what

345
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:07,520
are some ways we might create safe spaces for others create safe

346
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:13,280
communities or if we find ourselves as part of a community how can we support

347
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:20,359
the that Community to be a place that's inclusive that honors and recognizes and

348
00:57:20,359 --> 00:57:26,760
respects everybody from whatever background they have however they're

349
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:34,440
showing up and then maybe I'll close with this

350
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:40,640
um last um an excerpt from yet one more

351
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:48,200
suta that's this verse where the Buddha says one whose mind all day and night

352
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:57,480
takes Delight in harmlessness who has loving kindness for all beings for them there is no there is

353
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:05,079
antigon antagonism with none I'll say that again one whose mind

354
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:11,280
all day and night takes Delight in harmlessness who has loving kindness for

355
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,319
all beings for them there is antagonism

356
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:23,720
with none that is we can be a refuge for

357
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,119
others thank you
