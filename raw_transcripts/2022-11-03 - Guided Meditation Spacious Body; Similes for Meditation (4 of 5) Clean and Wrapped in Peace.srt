1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:10,340
so hello everyone warm greetings from

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:17,340
here at Insight Meditation Center and uh

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,740
dark morning I think it's just a little teeny bit of hint of light in the sky

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:29,400
out the windows so

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,640
what I'd like to say today from preparation of this meditation

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,040
is that um one of the discoveries in doing

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,780
mindfulness meditation maybe a lot of meditation that goes kind of kind of deep concentrated enough

8
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:57,480
is how much our experience is mediated by Concepts

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,760
Concepts that run quite deep in the mind so we don't really realize that we're

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,020
living in Concepts and so to give a very simple idea that

11
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:16,320
I'm looking here now that um the camera for seeing you all on

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:24,540
YouTube is on top of a bookcase with uh four shelves

13
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,500
I see it as a bookcase if we go back in history Maybe

14
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,920
a few only a few tens of thousands of years and bring this bookcase to the people

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,140
who lived on the planet at that time I don't think they would have seen it as

16
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,720
a bookcase I don't know what they would have

17
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,299
thought about it and I wouldn't know how they would use it maybe they'd put it down

18
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,119
flat on the ground on its back and use it to store different things

19
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:06,119
to distinct or maybe the store kindling for wood

20
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,900
maybe it was a kindling holder I don't know but they wouldn't see it as a book case that I'm sure

21
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,780
and the idea of seeing a bookcase I can do

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,680
uh you know effortlessly it's like you know

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:33,780
you know I don't have to think about conceive or have a thought bookcase it just you know what else could it be

24
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,959
so but as we sit and meditate this uh this subtle conceptual mind

25
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:46,860
begins to quiet and quiet and not seeing it as a bookcase in the

26
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:54,360
deep meditation is not a big deal particularly or relevant but what happens in with the eyes closed

27
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,400
meditating is that the concepts we have of our body

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,800
begins to dissolve begins to stop operating

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,860
so I think for the uh I think a couple of days ago

30
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:18,300
I clipped my fingernails and in my meditations over since then

31
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,239
uh I have not thought once about my fingernails

32
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,239
but I could have I could have thought my fingernails now short maybe I didn't cut them quite

33
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,459
right maybe they should have been more curved or rounded or this way or that way

34
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:42,599
and I'm having fingernail thoughts but but luckily for me I was able to

35
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:48,360
meditate without thinking about my fingernails I could think about

36
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:56,060
um you know that uh meditation think about my hair

37
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:02,400
and I have thoughts about my hair and how long it is and should I get a haircut or this or that

38
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,680
but luckily I did not have to think about my hair during meditation and so my hair and my fingernails

39
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,939
receded from attention receded from awareness something I wasn't really it

40
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:23,040
wasn't not only it wasn't really in my experience it wasn't really something that I thought about or that I I

41
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,639
perceived partly to in meditation to perceive

42
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,320
fingernails and hair I kind of need to have some concept idea

43
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:41,180
that's operating but without them they recede they kind of disappear

44
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:49,620
and um so as we sit and meditate if we sit in

45
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,960
front of a mirror and look at our face we have all kinds of face thoughts

46
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:03,540
but when we're sitting closed with eyes closed there's no maybe very few thoughts about the face

47
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:12,500
and the face is not that can still be a concept when we think about but there's no Direct

48
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,199
seeing of the face because there's no mirror that the eyes are open and the

49
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:26,000
ideas of her face come from memory and ideas unless there are kind of itching or pressure or tinkling in the face

50
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,440
warmth in the face then we feel Sensations but those Sensations can occur without the clear

51
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,840
mental image or clear uh self-conscious thought about what our

52
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,780
face looks like so this is a way of trying to explain that as we meditate deeper and deeper

53
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,060
the definitions the ideas the concepts that we use for the body begin to quiet

54
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:58,680
down and we begin finding the body after a while has no boundaries it has no edges

55
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:05,340
it has the things that we of course we have these things in the body but the conceiving of it the perception of it

56
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,440
quiets down and is entering into a world where the

57
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:18,600
body is experienced it's not experienced as solid not experienced as bounded

58
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,900
not experienced as something conceived or remembered

59
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:32,699
and it's uh just all these different uh um Sensations

60
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:41,880
but the sensations can exist without connecting it to a concept of that place

61
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,340
the warmth I feel the moment in my hand I can say hand

62
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:54,120
but I can also just experience the warmth without any concept of hand it's kind of

63
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:01,620
like in and of itself the warmth that just kind of hovering in a certain kind of space

64
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:09,440
and exists quite happily independently of idea of hand

65
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,880
the edges of the hand disappear and they're just warmth and other

66
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,300
Sensations there so so this is a direction that meditation

67
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:28,500
goes as the mind gets quieter the conceiving mind that thinking mind defining mind gets quieter

68
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,380
that the body begins to get more diffuse lighter

69
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:41,340
wispier there's feels feeling that there's lots of space in the body

70
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:48,180
that the edges are porous or the edges are diffuse they just

71
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:56,660
disappear so taking a comfortable upright posture

72
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,880
begin with being very clear idea of having a body

73
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:11,419
and you assume a nice posture with this body of you

74
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,300
and within this body aware of eyes

75
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:27,479
enclosing the eyes within this body a clear concept of

76
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:32,360
breathing and where breathing occurs in the body

77
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:45,260
and feeling what changes in your body as you take some long slow deep breaths

78
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,899
relaxing the shoulders and the exhale

79
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:06,440
relaxing the belly

80
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:14,180
letting the breathing return to normal

81
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,820
on the exhale relaxing the face muscles

82
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,339
and on the exhale relaxing

83
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,079
calming your thinking the thinking mind

84
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:13,860
so in the beginning of meditation Concepts ideas of the body are useful

85
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,800
and then to begin settling into breathing

86
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:32,120
and many other concepts of body are no longer needed letting them go in favor of

87
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,800
being attuned to the sensations of breathing

88
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,120
the rhythm of breathing

89
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,440
and as you breathe

90
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,760
let the attention

91
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:41,360
receive take in sensations of the body breathing

92
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:54,480
where what part of the body do you feel those Sensations

93
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,839
you don't you don't have to think about you don't have to operate with an idea

94
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:08,279
concept image of chest to feel the movements there

95
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:12,620
belly to feel the movements there

96
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,899
just movements just pressure release of pressure

97
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,380
expansion contraction

98
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:42,920
with every exhale quieting the thinking mind

99
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:01,800
or with every exhale letting go of your thoughts

100
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:09,320
letting them Drift Away like clouds drifting into the sky

101
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:25,280
as you're meditating there might be parts of your body

102
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,620
for which you have no perceptions of unless

103
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:41,000
you think about it for example you might not be perceiving

104
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:48,360
that toenail of your middle toe on your left

105
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,660
foot

106
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:09,120
maybe during this meditation so far there's been no perception

107
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,940
of one of the knuckles on your hand

108
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,740
until you go looking for it

109
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,280
if there's no backrest you're leaning against

110
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:38,880
the perceptions of your back rip cage are probably much more subtle than the

111
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,720
front rib cage

112
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:55,220
maybe there's a feeling of space around the subtle sensations of the back ribs

113
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,440
edges are diffuse

114
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:12,679
attune yourself to how within the body

115
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:21,120
that there's plenty of locations where there's more sense of space than there

116
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,400
is clear Sensations

117
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,940
where they're not sharp boundaries

118
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,640
and becoming aware of the space between Sensations

119
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,620
of your body

120
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:18,240
and in that place of space diffusion

121
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:26,700
absence of Concepts might there be a feeling of peace

122
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:34,340
Stillness maybe even safety

123
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,500
if there is stay close to that

124
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:47,000
breathe with it content

125
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,960
to rest for a few minutes

126
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:58,880
in this spacious Ness of the body

127
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,520
thank you

128
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,658
foreign

129
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,320
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

130
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:29,220
to imagine or feel or sense that the body is porous

131
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:36,559
that it's mostly made up of space at least the body that we

132
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:42,020
directly perceive with the eyes closed

133
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,299
the body that is not as is that is not conceived

134
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:53,000
but rather perceived through the senses

135
00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:01,940
that that perceived body is diffuse spacious open

136
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:13,260
and that the words people speak travels right through that space not

137
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:21,080
touching anything the things that we see in the world

138
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,980
in a way just kind of doesn't land in the space

139
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,340
the space is not troubled agitated by anything

140
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:46,919
and so the heart can be receptive and opened

141
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:54,240
without reacting Contracting asserting

142
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:02,778
in the spaciousness of the body the heart

143
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:11,299
can be kind you can move the world with

144
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:15,320
simple good will

145
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,440
looking upon all things kindly

146
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:30,379
looking upon all things with the generosity of care

147
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:37,639
with the spaciousness of the body

148
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,960
maybe may we care for the welfare and happiness of others

149
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,480
may all beings be happy

150
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,898
may all beings be safe

151
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,620
may all beings be peaceful

152
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,360
and may all beings be free

153
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,829
[Music]

154
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,530
[Music]

155
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:34,340
thank you

156
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,759
so we come to the fourth talk on the similes for meditation

157
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:58,520
and we're going through the similes that are used for

158
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:04,980
strong concentration practice for the genres for absorptions

159
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:12,480
and where they these similes are particularly uh apt particularly representative of some

160
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,840
of the deeper experiences in the the kind of phases through which

161
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:27,320
clearly clear kind of stages or phases that we go through as the mind gets really settled and focused quiet

162
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:36,179
and I I appreciate how much these uh descriptions who work for meditation well short of

163
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:42,620
deep absorption that meditation even uh even mildly

164
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:48,840
excited meditation goes through phases and the body the sense of the body

165
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:56,880
changes or their sense of self changes all kinds of things changes uh and as we settle even

166
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,360
modestly and some of what the the similes for deep concentration

167
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:10,620
represent or how they feel can be experienced sometimes in lighter meditation and to

168
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:19,340
recognize and feel like kind of supports the deepening support's sort of opening up to settling even more and more

169
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:27,960
and part of the advantage of being sensitive to some of these shifts and changes in in um in uh

170
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:35,460
in more ordinary deepening of meditation is that we're starting to get comfortable with it to recognize it so

171
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,500
when the meditation is really deep we're already somewhat familiar and we

172
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:46,559
recognize it and we don't get excited or sometimes people get afraid or or kind

173
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,720
of confused by it we're already familiar with kind of oh now I know this is just

174
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,778
a deepening of what I've already had and know about

175
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,220
so we come to the simile for the fourth genre

176
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:08,399
the fourth John is estate a very deep tranquility and equanimity

177
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,799
and um and in it the uh because fourth child of

178
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:18,860
the mind is so still and quiet that there's very little Concepts

179
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:26,159
conceiving making of Concepts in which through which we see ourselves and the

180
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:33,120
world around us and in fact there's no but the eyes closed there's no thoughts no conception

181
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,880
no perception of the world around us anymore because we're so subtle and

182
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,039
content and peaceful here that everything else recedes

183
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:51,480
and one of the things that recedes from awareness when we're quite settled and peaceful and the mind is calm is the

184
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:58,559
sharp definitions of the body the sharp the way we understand the body

185
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,980
and so much of uh experience of the body

186
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:09,240
is in fact mediated through Concepts being self-conscious about the body

187
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:15,240
often has to do with maybe comparisons one concept versus another

188
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:23,339
We compare our body with someone else's body type our body is to

189
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:29,820
thin or too large or too small or too something and uh and it's possible to

190
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:36,839
get really wrapped up in body Consciousness and these ideas and Concepts that have a lot to do with

191
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:42,000
comparative thinking impairing ourselves to an ideal to other people to how we

192
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,440
were when we were younger and this is all navigating in the world of Concepts and ideas which belongs to the world of

193
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,898
of uh thinking mind conceptual mind

194
00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:00,900
um the body in and of itself in the terms of its perceptions of

195
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,660
itself where uh perceiving sensations of the body the

196
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,720
sensations of the body are free and independent of the concepts we have

197
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,359
and this where someone you know with regular Street Consciousness this might be inconceivable

198
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:23,640
that there are we can experience the body without any concepts especially if

199
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,680
if their concepts are so deeply ingrained in the mind we don't even know

200
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,960
that we're conceiving them and um

201
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,960
and so uh but there's there's kind of this very you know deep layers of the

202
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,839
Mind where conceptions operate even without words even without images it's

203
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:54,960
just kind of there and all that can get quieter and quieter and we can start perceiving the body

204
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,020
um uh without kind of really any without seeing it without any clear sense that

205
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:07,500
there is a body here so the simile that's for this is a

206
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:13,440
delightful simile of a person a little bit I embellish it but the

207
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,560
person you know they're two earlier ones have to do of the being a lake kind of being in a lake

208
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:26,460
and imagine that you've gone for a nice bath lay swim in a beautiful clear water

209
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:33,359
and you've come out of the lake and and maybe you've been grimy and dirty even backpacking or hiking or something and

210
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:40,020
you're been maybe days without a shower and finally you're able to go to this beautiful quiet Lake and clean yourself

211
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:45,839
really thoroughly and well and all the dirt and grime is off you and

212
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:51,540
and you come back on the shore and you're very contented

213
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:57,300
very happy there's nothing to do nothing to be you've arrived where you want to come be

214
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:04,859
and um and you someone gives you a um completely clean

215
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:12,000
um soft cotton blanket to wrap yourself around in him and uh

216
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:19,440
completely enveloped in this blanket so that no part of the body is not covered by this blanket this

217
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,599
and um and in a land where there's flies and insects flying around you're

218
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:30,720
protected from those in the blanket you're protected from the Sun and nothing comes in

219
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:38,820
um that way maybe you're protected from the wind it just feels so nice and safe and protected inside this blanket

220
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:45,060
and because you're inside completely enveloped in this blanket uh no one no

221
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:50,280
one you can't see the body the blanket kind of the soft kind of

222
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,980
Gauzy blanket um means the body is not seen

223
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:01,380
but inside that blanket the person you is completely feeling clean so Purity

224
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:08,220
there's a cleanliness there's a radiating feeling that can happen after you're really clean perhaps a shower or

225
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:16,200
a bath or something and very content and and kind of peaceful

226
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:22,140
feeling of everything is good and everything is right in the world

227
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:28,560
so that's a simile that this person enveloped in a clean cotton blanket

228
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:37,859
um and no part not covered and um and so in this deep meditation of

229
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:46,500
the blanket shows us that you can't see the body we don't perceive the body in ordinary ways the body gets diffuse gets

230
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:53,339
it kind of disappears there might be individual Sensations the here and there but they're very almost disappear

231
00:38:53,339 --> 00:39:00,180
entirely remember the similarly before yesterday there's still things in the lake

232
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:06,900
the lake still has a certain kind of substantiality there's water in it

233
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:13,500
that and there's individual lotus flowers floating in the lake so there might still be Sensations in

234
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:20,520
the body they're just floating in the lake floating in this kind of spaciousness of the water

235
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:25,560
and this four assembly there's all you know really almost there

236
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,720
can be almost no Sensations at all of the body um there's uh that almost like the body

237
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:37,740
disappears except for this feeling of cleanliness

238
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:44,460
of refreshment that's come from the from the bath this feeling of being peaceful

239
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:52,380
being tranquil this feeling of being equanimous just everything's okay the work the of what

240
00:39:52,380 --> 00:40:00,119
you had to do has been finished nothing needs to happen there's nothing the next contentment there's no

241
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:06,060
reactivity of the mind no being for or against anything just very

242
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:11,820
very content and deep there's no clear sense of rapture or pleasure or Joy or

243
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:17,220
Delight there's something that feels more satisfying which is a kind of this

244
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:22,320
kind of feeling of deep kind of cleanliness and Purity and peace that

245
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:28,400
seems to radiate kind of where the body used to be

246
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:34,200
and um and it's a lovely experience

247
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,540
I've known people and I've done this where the body seems to disappear in these states

248
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:46,500
and kind of beginning doubting do I really have a body anymore has my body really disappeared and then opening the

249
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:52,980
eyes to see looking into the body's still there it didn't go away

250
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:59,099
because the sense of the body disappearing is so strong that that you want to check and make

251
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:04,619
sure you're still there and um so uh

252
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:10,260
the so one of the important lessons in this

253
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:15,720
kind of through the simile and but also the kind of meditation that's can be a little bit like this

254
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:23,579
is that as meditation deepens where uh experiencing ourselves experience our

255
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:32,480
life free of many of the ordinary Concepts that we live with on automatic pilot

256
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:39,660
and some of these Concepts that we take for granted We Believe to find reality this is what's really happening

257
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:46,440
turns out to be provisional turns out to be just concepts conceivings of the Mind

258
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,720
and they're not inherent they're not exactly what they have they don't have to be there

259
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:57,000
and when a lot of these concepts of ourselves our body and what's going on

260
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,280
um bring us a really heavy a burden or bring a lot of suffering and distress

261
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:09,060
it's kind of surprising and radical to have all those Concepts disappear and

262
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:14,640
stop and feel this deep peace and contentment without anything in the world having

263
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:23,760
been fixed or anything you know challenges in our body that we have fixed because the body

264
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:32,520
just has somehow there's a different way of experiencing life or a different way of experiencing that is not mediated by the concepts

265
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:38,700
that we are usually navigating or struggling with and that puts a little question mark

266
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:44,700
after the concepts after the struggles we have is this really as real as I

267
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:49,800
thought it was is this really a substantial and necessary as I thought

268
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:56,760
it was there is another way here the Buddha when he was a in the suit

269
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:02,700
does and the discourses there's um talking him himself as an old man 80

270
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:09,180
year old man and back in Ancient India there were no pain medication there was no the kind of

271
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:14,880
medications that we have that can make aging so much more easier there's there

272
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,099
was no palliative care in hospitals to reduce the pain

273
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:26,520
and um and he wrote he told you he talked about how much his body hurt and

274
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:34,440
was creaky and um that he was bent over in his old age his back and and um and that the only

275
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:40,260
place that he got relief from all his pain was to go into this deep state of

276
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:48,000
meditation that the symboly is for and I imagine that's where he got refreshed and renewed so that he can

277
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,880
continue going on with his life with this creaky old painful body kind of

278
00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:00,960
lifted it for a while and refreshed him and and um and um

279
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,980
so this kind of meditation is very useful for us and can help a lot

280
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:13,200
but the biggest help for people doing mindfulness meditation it can begin to

281
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:20,819
free us from The Authority the hegemony of Concepts and ideas

282
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:28,220
and we see them as provisional conditional contingent

283
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:34,760
um not always necessary to live by them and this is kind of a paradigm shift

284
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:40,980
that meditation can take us to and hopefully in doing so help us be

285
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:46,500
much wiser navigating in the world of Concepts

286
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:53,640
so um thank you and so we have one more simile

287
00:44:53,640 --> 00:45:01,140
and that'll be tomorrow and I think sometimes people go away on Friday

288
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:07,740
and so we don't quite have as many people here so maybe I'll make an announcement today and tomorrow about

289
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:14,040
the next few weeks is that uh next week uh Cod o'connellan

290
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:20,880
will be leading the the 7 A.M while I'm on Retreat and the

291
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,099
following week um May Elliott will give the

292
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:33,060
the talks also went on one retreat and they're they're related to each other

293
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:39,599
they're married and they're both of them in the imc's teacher training program they're wonderfully promising young

294
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:45,839
teachers and they have a little similar background as myself in that they have

295
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:52,800
also been practicing with the San Francisco Zen Center have a Zen background and kodo is actually a priest

296
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:59,280
there and um like I was and but also very deeply personal practitioners and

297
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,280
now you know in our in our the personal insight to teacher training program they're a delight and I think you'll

298
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,160
enjoy them quite a bit and um and then the following two weeks after that I'm going away for Thanksgiving and

299
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:16,500
then I do another Retreat so I won't be here for four weeks and um

300
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:22,920
and uh the um um but you'll be taken care of somehow

301
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:28,800
and uh during this time and I think it's very supportive for all of you when you

302
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:35,520
show up for each other here so I hope that you you know you're you offer that

303
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:42,000
support and I'll I'll um be back in in the beginning of December but I'm here

304
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,579
tomorrow great thank you
