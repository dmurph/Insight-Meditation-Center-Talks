1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:07,279
welcome welcome and happy New Year again

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,380
hard to believe right here we go one more year

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,800
and it's not uncommon of course at the beginning of a new year or new season or

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,019
new something to reflect back on the preceding

5
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,660
era time and to look forward

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,960
to what we would like to do or how we would like the next year or whatever to

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,320
be different

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:51,980
so maybe one way in which we do this is to think about what would we like to prioritize in our life the next year

9
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,719
chances are if you're here that maybe meditation has a role there if you made

10
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:06,119
it here on a rainy I think it's a holiday for some people today so if you if you made your way

11
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:12,140
here maybe uh meditation it's part not necessarily though but

12
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,479
and then so I kind of want to wrap this in with a the theme I want to continue

13
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,979
from the last time I spoke about kind of like effort and energy like applying effort and having energy

14
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:32,580
and how can we do that in a way that's helpful and supportive and honors and

15
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,939
respects the amount of energy we have without demanding that we have a different amount

16
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:42,960
necessarily and working with it to make our lives shape

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,280
Our Lives have our lives head in the direction we would like because it's not a secret that if we

18
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,340
want our lives to unfold a little bit differently than effort has to be part

19
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,520
of that part of that equation because no matter what we would like to

20
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,179
prioritize in our lives a sense of maybe a little activity or effort or energy is

21
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,840
what's needed to take it out of the theoretical into something that's actually gets done to take it out of

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,020
this idea or a wish into something that actually happens

23
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:28,020
I'm really good at just coming up with these great ideas so I'm going to do this I'm going to do that I'm going to

24
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,720
do this yeah that's as far as it goes sometimes right

25
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:41,519
just having these ideas so to help us kind of bridge this gap

26
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,519
between aspiring to doing something and actually like losing it

27
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,180
but what is this effort towards like what like maybe we can unpack this

28
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,720
a little bit and part of it is to do something other than just follow our

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,920
preferences and follow our habits right if we don't to play an effort that's the direction Our Lives will go maybe that's

30
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,680
okay but if we want it to broaden or to add

31
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,680
some different elements or shift the direction a little bit so we have to do something other than just follow our

32
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,879
habits and preferences and this takes energy

33
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,459
because right there are habits they are from uh this kind of like

34
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,640
stream that we might say of um activity the body the Mind create habits as a way

35
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,640
to conserve energy right things just kind of go on autopilot so energy is required if we want things to be

36
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,860
different if we want to do something different than we usually

37
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:57,420
do when I was thinking about this I noticed this is like a minor thing that but in

38
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:04,260
my own life something that I realized yeah this is going to take a little bit of effort I have this habit of

39
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,299
sitting at my computer and not putting my computer classes on so I'm spending

40
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:16,320
all this time you know going like this bad posture squinching right it's terrible it's just like this habit I

41
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,040
have of I can't quite see with my regular glasses I just I don't put my computer glasses on and the end of the

42
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,240
day I have this tension in my neck and shoulders this is a minor thing but right every day

43
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,020
day after day week after week month after month right this adds up so it will take a little bit of effort

44
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:43,680
for me to notice when I'm just have this habit of doing this so we have these habits of things that

45
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:51,000
we do but we also have these habits that are part of like with our relationships

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,100
or maybe there's habits that get supported by the social structure

47
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:02,040
that we're in there's a I had a friend who would

48
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:09,540
I really enjoyed reading blogs that were really polemic that were really about

49
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:16,740
you know we are right and everybody else is wrong and this was years and years ago but it

50
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,199
was quite something if this person my friend had just finished reading one of

51
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,539
these kind of like articles and then I happened to have a conversation with them it was quite something to feel like

52
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:33,539
all this righteous indignation and we've got to do something and like not seeing

53
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:38,759
quite clearly like not taking in the bigger picture just stuck in a small

54
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:45,000
picture about something but if it's our habit it's to you know look at our

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,539
phones in the morning and our phones are filled with this kind of this polemic

56
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:57,539
whether it's a podcast or a something that we read or substag

57
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:03,960
whatever it might be you know that's going to have an impact on us too

58
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,620
so if we want to do something different G

59
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:18,120
so I'm going to Define effort as Applied Energy and we might think of

60
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,639
energy as like this maybe this sense of Vitality we have maybe it has a little

61
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,740
bit of a like a buzzing maybe a little bit of

62
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,780
vibration to it I don't even know if that's the right word exactly but

63
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,300
it can also just be a sense of like feeling good like having having energy

64
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,660
is like feeling present I know in the Buddhist world energy and

65
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:53,520
effort have different poly words but sometimes those poly words have the same

66
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,100
definition so sometimes we talk about effort when we're and energy and kind of

67
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:05,819
just mix them up together but for what I'm doing tonight I'm going to Define effort as Applied Energy

68
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:11,160
and some of you might know that in the Eightfold Path which is this path

69
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,860
towards Awakening and not surprising as eight aspects to it

70
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,560
that one of them is what we call like wise effort

71
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,099
like how how to apply effort and something that I'll

72
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:34,800
highlight here that is as part of the Eightfold Path it's really pointing to

73
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:42,060
the direction of effort like what are we going to spend our life energy on what

74
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,220
direction are we going to go and what direction are we not going to go

75
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,259
so we could say kind of in a really broad brush that

76
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:58,500
the wise effort sometimes called right effort right in terms of not moralistic

77
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:08,039
right versus wrong but right as in terms of the best tool for the job

78
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:13,139
if we have to put a nail in we don't grab a screwdriver the right tool is a

79
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,960
hammer that kind of a thing so wise effort is this idea that if we

80
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,599
want to diminish what leads to suffering for ourselves and others

81
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:30,419
and we want to increase what leads to our well-being and others well-being

82
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:35,940
it's kind of right effort in a nutshell has more elements to it but you know

83
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:42,000
diminishing suffering and increasing well-being I don't think anybody will protest with

84
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,200
this I think probably all spiritual practices have this direction also

85
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,800
but I like um Gregory Kramer he has this sub definition he says uh right effort

86
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:03,420
is the energy of swimming towards the wholesome and away from the unwholesome I like

87
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:10,200
this idea of swimming because like we're moving through water there's a little bit of pressure again says it does take

88
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,240
a little bit of effort but also we can float on the top too right it sometimes

89
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,420
can just be a really restful effort but sometimes there can be this sense of

90
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:29,339
reading to swim and he he just uh summarizes right

91
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:36,480
effort as out with the bad and in with the good again I don't think anybody will uh

92
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,640
disagree with this but those um

93
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:48,240
so here what's the bad or you know those things that cause harm but it's also we might say not only

94
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,760
actions that cause harm but mental qualities what are we doing with our

95
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,820
minds is it helpful or is it unhelpful

96
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,860
this word helpful it's often sometimes a translation for this word kusala

97
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:11,279
the same word gets translated as wholesome skillful helpful

98
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:19,019
so not only are actions which maybe that's a little bit more obvious to be aware of that but really what are we

99
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:26,760
doing with our minds also and so there's a classic core of

100
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:33,600
teachings of what is abandoned you know like the unwholesome so many dermatocs are about these I'm

101
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,140
just going to list some of them don't worry I'm not going to go through all of these but this what are what are some of these

102
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:46,260
things that are the unhelpful five hindrances things that hinder that

103
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:51,779
get in the way of the mind being settled and having some

104
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:56,880
collectedness there's the three unwholesome Roots it's

105
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,760
this idea that at the base as the foundation of everything

106
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:09,839
that's unhelpful there's only just three things great hatred or we might sometimes call

107
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:16,500
it aversion and delusion sometimes called ignorance and sometimes it's helpful just to

108
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:23,220
simplify things greed really wanting more aversion or hatred you know to kind of

109
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:31,040
pushing away and delusion just not paying attention at all or being completely unaware

110
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,839
I know sometimes in my practice that can be helpful because maybe I don't really

111
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,180
have the exact word but there's maybe just this more this feeling of maybe

112
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:47,820
leaning more or wanting more sometimes we might use uh pooling like

113
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,579
wanting something or leaning forward

114
00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:00,120
also as part of this classic core of what is abandoned or the taints

115
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,940
these are said to what's abandoned when a person is awakened

116
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,339
and we can understand these tits as the intoxication with sense Pleasures this

117
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:18,440
idea that just pursuing endless sense Pleasures is the way to

118
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,880
Everlasting happiness sometimes we're happy if we have some

119
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:29,640
pleasure but it's not reliable and it certainly isn't Everlasting right we're always chasing

120
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:38,519
the next one so the taints intoxication with sense Pleasures intoxication with self-making

121
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:45,180
that is setting up the I'm the person who does X

122
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:53,100
and I don't do y I'm the person who is kind and I am not

123
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,139
unkind and so we have to ignore all those times when we don't let that

124
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:04,680
person in front of us in traffic or we're ignoring the person who's talking too loud or whatever it might be

125
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,139
but this sense of having to adopt a

126
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:15,779
belief about ourselves and not only do we have to adopt this

127
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:22,320
belief but we have to kind of make sure that everybody else believes it too and this takes a tremendous amount of

128
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,860
propping up and energy and time and effort and shows up in so many different ways

129
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:34,320
it turns out that having this belief is extra

130
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:41,040
we don't need it but this is something that kind of unfolds with practice it's not helpful

131
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,200
for me to just say this it's something that really you need to have this

132
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,360
experience but maybe I'll point to you briefly

133
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:58,920
there's times when like this righteous indignation when we hear something that really angers us that we feel like oh

134
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:06,060
how dare they and there can be a strong sense of they shouldn't do that there's a strong sense

135
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,579
of self then it might be helpful and appropriate but if you contrast that

136
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:16,740
with when you're doing your favorite hobby there's not such a sense of self when

137
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,920
you're knitting or doing gardening or something like this you're not thinking about

138
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:29,579
yourself you're thinking about whatever it is that you're doing so to have this really strong sense of

139
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:35,160
self I'm over here and all everybody else is over there just takes extra

140
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,639
energy it's not necessary and then one of the taints is ignorance

141
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:47,279
so these three taints these are said that's what's uh let go of with

142
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,440
Awakening this understanding that sense Pleasures

143
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:59,399
is not what's going to lead to Awakening we don't need to be make creating this

144
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,920
self and there's no longer ignorance instead there's a clear seeing of the

145
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:12,839
way things are and then maybe the last thing that I'll mention here is this classic core part

146
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,940
of because it's at the beginning of the year I thought I would say some of these things

147
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,639
is uh clinging it's amazing right how many things we

148
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,040
can cling to even the things that we don't want we cling to them and some

149
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,040
kind of convoluted way so these are some of the classic core of what is abandoned

150
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,579
with right effort and then what is cultivated are seven

151
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:48,420
factors of Awakening I just completed a series I talked about the seven factors and I'm teaching a

152
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,639
course on the seven factors online just as the name sounds like these are

153
00:15:53,639 --> 00:16:00,899
things that really support Awakening some of these seven I won't list all of them but some of them are like Joy

154
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:06,120
and some of them it's uh Equanimity you know having some balance some

155
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,899
concentration having some collectedness and energy is also one of them right we

156
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:20,579
need to have some energy or effort the five faculties something else that's

157
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:25,639
cultivated this um overlap some with the seven factors

158
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:31,560
mindfulness energy oh sorry I'll do this in order Faith

159
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,720
energy mindfulness um

160
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,940
concentration and wisdom there's so many different ways we

161
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:47,220
cultivate those we cultivate the Brahma of ahuras

162
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:54,300
these are for practices of the heart loving kindness compassion sympathetic joy and

163
00:16:54,300 --> 00:17:01,740
equanimity and the ten pyromes and I'll go through this long list of the poemies

164
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:08,579
so there's this you know the Buddhist love lists right so and I'm one of those people that like the lists

165
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:13,918
things to abandon things to cultivate so right effort is really pointing us

166
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:23,959
towards that but I would make a distinction between this right effort and balanced effort

167
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,000
so balanced effort isn't the difference or the balance between making effort and

168
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,240
not making effort said it's the balance or that's the

169
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:43,500
recognizing what is the right amount of effort to apply to the task at hand

170
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,900
and what's the right amount of effort to apply given the type of energy we have at the time

171
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:55,140
sometimes we have lots of energy sometimes we don't or maybe we have an illness and we rarely have lots of

172
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,780
energy we're not being asked to be different than who we are we're just

173
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:06,360
it's being pointed to to be wise about how we use the energy that we have

174
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:12,740
and to not use too much and not too little

175
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:18,179
so the Buddha I appreciate very much this

176
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:24,600
uh little simile about having the right amount of energy for whatever it is we're going to do

177
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:33,179
and he uh has this simile suppose a person was to hold a quail you

178
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:39,360
know these little birds right we have California quills they're so adorable with their little things on their heads

179
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,900
suppose a person were to hold a quail too tightly in their hands

180
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:52,440
it would die right there oh it's just awful to think about right

181
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:59,940
suppose a person were to hold a quail too loosely it would fly out of their hands

182
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:07,559
so this idea of not too tight and not too loose it's about you know how to apply the

183
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:14,460
right amount of energy so sometimes when we hear about right efforts or applying effort we might

184
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:23,780
think that this is some type of intense Focus or some has some intensity to it

185
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:29,179
but um quoting Gregory Kramer again I appreciate very much that he says that

186
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:37,500
that have balanced effort is like the strenuous effort required to turn

187
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:45,179
the soil and plant our Gardens get in there with the right tools

188
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:53,340
trowel or whatever might be needed shovels and other times the effort is like the

189
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:59,160
steady application of the sun's Heat we need all of these things to make

190
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:05,460
things grow so sometimes we're in there really exerting energy and sometimes there's

191
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,100
more just like this gentle Heat

192
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,440
and so part of the art of practice is Discerning well what what is needed here

193
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,720
when are we giving too much and when is it too little

194
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:28,860
part of recognizing if it's too little it's not uncommon when there's too little effort there often is a feeling

195
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:36,240
of discouragement which then can lead to doubt because there's like we don't quite see anything

196
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,640
happening we're applying a little bit of effort and we're getting a little bit of

197
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:48,840
results and it's true right this practice sometimes we don't see results in a

198
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:54,480
short time frame sometimes it's not until we look back over months that we

199
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,539
start to see oh yeah I am showing up in the world a little bit differently I do have a

200
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:07,679
little bit different inner voice sometimes that shows up that allows me to be more kind towards myself or kind

201
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,320
towards others or more patient or something like this

202
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:20,340
but I also want to acknowledge that I feel like um these days like these days being like

203
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:26,760
after the pandemic and as we're still trying to find our way with the new

204
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:33,059
normal that many of us feel depleted there's a

205
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:39,360
way in which there's maybe this is not as much energy for what used to

206
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,659
be meaningful for us or maybe it's a lack of enthusiasm I don't know exactly what it is

207
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:52,200
but maybe it's like this um coach and Paley Ellison he's a zen

208
00:21:52,200 --> 00:22:01,200
teacher he describes it as like the oxygen has left our life somehow

209
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,020
and this recognition that we might feel flat or a little bit disengaged or not

210
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:13,380
quite attuned to what's happening with our life that there's maybe a little bit

211
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:19,380
of just going through the motions and we feel like we're living a little bit

212
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:25,559
like from a distance from what's really happening not quite engaged with it and

213
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:32,820
then all our energy is going to just doing the next thing that needs to be done just to get through the day just to

214
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:41,520
get through the to-do list or you know finish the tasks so there isn't this energy to if we want

215
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:48,179
to make different priorities for our life if we want our life to turn to be differently if we want to be cultivating

216
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:55,980
the skillful wholesome helpful and abandoning the unskillful and wholesome

217
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:03,840
how are we going to do that or are we feeling like maybe overwhelmed what we just don't have the energy for it

218
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,900
well often when German teachers talk about effort and energy myself included

219
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:16,679
often we're talking well some teachers I tend to not do this because

220
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:24,299
maybe I'll tell this little story that at the beginning of a long retreat there was a one of the very first Talks Of The

221
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:30,600
Retreat right where we all are kind of showing up and kind of eager to do this whole retreat thing

222
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,360
and this one teacher talked about a retreat he had done in Asia

223
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:43,980
it was so hard and they could only sleep for four hours and we had to be sit you

224
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:52,260
know up you are not allowed to move for hours at a time and this person described how they lost like so much

225
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:57,480
weight because there wasn't enough food and like and it was months of this and

226
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,179
all of us I well I should say me my eyes are getting big like oh my gosh okay I

227
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:09,299
guess that's what's required oh my gosh that was so horrible Retreat it was so hard and I ended up getting

228
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:15,360
myself really it happened and tight not striving with my you know shoulders up near my ears and it was completely

229
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,640
unhelpful but sometimes teachers Like Straw Strife

230
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,179
you know you gotta do this or I don't know if they say that sometimes that's what we hear right

231
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:33,240
because maybe you know this doing that type of work really helped us maybe in our academic setting or in our

232
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:41,039
professional life but something different is needed here so I'd like to offer a little something

233
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,200
different here and that is this poem by a practitioner her name is Sylvia

234
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:54,000
ostertuck and this poem is called tiredness

235
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,220
and it's about have to practice with tiredness and

236
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:06,559
maybe how it actually can be really helpful so the poem goes like this

237
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,700
tiredness is no obstacle to sitting in silence

238
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:19,320
but to think tiredness is an obstacle

239
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:25,740
that is an obstacle when you stop thinking this you can sit

240
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:34,140
in silence very well with tiredness however tired you are

241
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:41,580
then at last you are too tired to get stressed and want to achieve anything

242
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:47,760
too tired to bully your breath and keep griping about yourself

243
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,220
perhaps even too tired to think

244
00:25:53,220 --> 00:26:00,000
that the only thing to do is to abandon yourself

245
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
gently for this brief moment into the silence

246
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,220
now I appreciate this this idea of you know

247
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:20,580
tiredness is maybe there's a way in that just supports a certain letting go

248
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:27,179
and earlier I had talked about that selfing is something that we're moving

249
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:32,760
away from with this practice and I appreciate she's perhaps even too tired

250
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,799
to think and the only thing to do is to abandon

251
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:44,340
yourself gently so when we talk about energy and effort

252
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:51,480
we often are thinking about how much we have to apply but I also want to introduce this idea that we can practice

253
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,900
with whatever is amount of energy we have and maybe there's even sometimes

254
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:03,240
advantages to having a little bit of energy maybe there's times when we feel

255
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,340
depleted or uninspired

256
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,820
can we sit anyway without this idea of

257
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:21,960
we have to achieve anything what does she say here at last you are too tired to get

258
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:28,679
stressed and want to achieve anything there's some sweetness to this I think

259
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:34,080
it's really tender instead of you know trying to prop

260
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:41,460
ourselves up in some kind of way but I mean there are times in which we

261
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,220
have this exhaustion and it may be due to not enough sleep

262
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:53,159
maybe due to illness maybe just simply because we're working too much

263
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:58,279
maybe you're spread thin with lots of responsibilities

264
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:05,100
but sometimes this exhaustion is not because of something external like that

265
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:12,179
sometimes it's about what's um happening internally

266
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:18,779
so can we pay attention when we start to feel exhausted and have this idea is it

267
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:25,159
about you know am I just simply too overextended or not getting enough sleep

268
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:31,559
or is it should I like have this uh investigation what is draining the

269
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:36,779
energy what is it that straining energy and

270
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:43,860
maybe it's something like trying to please everyone that's exhausting

271
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:50,400
right it doesn't work or maybe we're doing too much because

272
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:56,640
we're trying to feel indispensable or trying to feel important or something

273
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,700
like this that's also exhausting or maybe

274
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:08,340
we're not able to ask for help or to delegate

275
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:13,980
in our professional life or family life or you know we find it difficult to ask

276
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:20,520
others to do something so we end up doing everything ourselves

277
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:28,080
and feeling exhausted maybe even feel a little bit resentful and that adds to the sense of exhaustion

278
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:34,740
or maybe it's just we're not taking care of ourselves we're not eating well and exercising we all know we should do this

279
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:40,440
right and sometimes it shows up with our just being tired

280
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:47,039
when we don't uh take the or spend the energy or effort to take care of our

281
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,860
physical bodies but I I also want to address one more

282
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:59,460
thing that might fuel exhaustion and sometimes at the beginning of the new year we might

283
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:06,480
have some ambitious ideas about what we're going to do okay this

284
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:13,440
is the year that I'm going to do whatever it is not everybody does this but if we're

285
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:20,700
going to do it sometimes it's tempting to do it this time of year to make these like big changes

286
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,980
but in these times when we believe that anything is possible we have like these

287
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:31,860
peaks of energy yes I'm gonna do it this is the time finally

288
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:38,520
no matter what I'm gonna make this happen and sometimes that works fantastic and it does happen

289
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:46,440
but sometimes these peaks of energy are followed by valleys of energy to

290
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,380
and part of that not all of it but part of it is if we have this idea that we're

291
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:59,100
going to make a big change even if it's something that we want it can elicit like a fear response

292
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:04,919
there's something in us that's not so comfortable with making big changes

293
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:12,240
and that of course this fear response shows up as like putting on the brakes and kind of like sucking out all the

294
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,700
energy of what it is we want to do so just a recognition that that also could

295
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:24,120
be something that has a role if we're feeling like oh we just don't have the energy

296
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:30,059
for to do this right effort to this

297
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:37,020
Orient Our Lives towards cultivating what's helpful and wholesome and abandoning what's not helpful and

298
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:44,940
wholesome so maybe it's helpful to just focus on little things that we can do

299
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:50,340
to improve situations Maybe not maybe it's great to do grand gestures and big

300
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:56,880
plans but maybe it's helpful to just think about hmm is there something a little something

301
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,340
that I might do differently the next time I'm doing this is there something I can learn about

302
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,860
this instead of this turning things into a big Grand project

303
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:13,440
so that we Can it can be a little bit more sustainable in this movement that

304
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,658
we would like our Direction our life to go

305
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,960
so maybe I'll stop there with uh talking about energy and effort

306
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,299
and this idea that there's sometimes Dharma teachers talk about right effort

307
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:37,679
and balanced effort and they kind of put them together but sometimes it's helpful to tease them apart right effort is

308
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,840
about like the direction we want to go and balanced effort is you know are we

309
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:48,600
gonna squeeze this poor little Quail or are we going to let it make it fly away

310
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:54,179
or so that it uh doesn't we don't have any energy of what

311
00:32:54,179 --> 00:33:01,020
we're doing so and maybe with that I'll open it up and see if there's some questions or

312
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,559
comments

313
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:31,559
foreign happy New Year Diana thank you so much I

314
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:39,960
really liked um your Dharma talk especially in regards to just the effort and the sense

315
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,299
of self and whether or not I'm applying I think I'm just grateful that through

316
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:51,480
meditation I'm more aware of that the sense of self I'm just

317
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:58,440
now with the new year upon us I just want to make sure that whatever it is that I'm clinging to with

318
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,659
my sense of self that I can approach it every day with like do you have any

319
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:08,940
questions like oh and Rose I noticed that I'm trying to

320
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:15,599
be X or Y or be perceived a certain way or you know it's I don't think to help

321
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,820
point out or to help you realize when that's a sense of self is strong yes so

322
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:27,780
that way I can just go about life without having to strive for or be

323
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:35,419
whatever it is that I just I just want to be there be just be here yeah

324
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:42,300
so I think you're talking about there's a number of things I think that you're saying one is when is there a strong

325
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:48,540
sense of self and when especially when it's tied up with striving like trying to make things different is that is that

326
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:55,679
right or yes yeah so one thing I'll say a hint or a clue about when there's a

327
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,800
strong sense of self is when there's a strong sense of other like oh those people over there

328
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:08,460
whenever that's happening there's a strong sense of self too so that's impossible for that not to happen so

329
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:15,000
just to notice and it takes sometimes it can be energizing like I'm

330
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,920
in the right and they are wrong and then you have this sense of energy and it maybe it feels nice but it's taxing it's

331
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,380
really right this really doesn't lead to a good life right of doing this then

332
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:33,900
this sense of striving I even had some notes in here I was going to talk about it if we had a

333
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:39,240
little bit more time but one thing that um

334
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:45,180
can be helpful to think about is often there's uh what's fueling or underneath

335
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:53,160
striving is some fear like this fear right of uh missing out

336
00:35:53,160 --> 00:36:00,060
or fear of having regret or fear of

337
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:05,160
um turning into a slug or something right

338
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:11,280
like there's uh there can there can be something like that that's fueling this driving so it can be a strong sense of

339
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,180
self and fears often tied up with that but that might just be something to

340
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:22,500
have some curiosity about is there is there a sense of something I'm trying to

341
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:28,680
avoid or I'm afraid of or something like that and that fear or

342
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:34,619
yeah can be fueling striving okay is that helpful very much thank you so much

343
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:39,290
yeah you're welcome you're welcome [Music]

344
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:46,859
oh thank you for a nice talk about uh

345
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:53,119
um energy and effort of effort and energy and

346
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,838
um I um and also three

347
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:07,700
um points you talked about were the greed hatred and delusion

348
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:14,700
I don't know if you agree with me whether they it falls under

349
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:20,820
one um point which is ego I mean greedy is a

350
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:26,839
form of ego delusion is a form of ego or um

351
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:34,200
and hatred is a form of ego some kind

352
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:41,480
um so how that ego can be lowered or like or be

353
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:47,820
dispelled is important the second thing is

354
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:55,859
um is when we are when you talk about the energy and you know the effort and being

355
00:37:55,859 --> 00:38:01,079
tired um personally for example I have been

356
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:08,040
interested in uh finding you know more like-minded people let's say

357
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:13,200
and for with whom I can talk about let's say Dharma talk and you know these

358
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:19,079
things they were not necessarily here it's like 45 minutes and we are done

359
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:25,800
but so I I wonder if you have any comments on that so we can multiply that

360
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:33,060
energy and you know that so that is one question I have yeah yeah

361
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:40,020
so the first one about is ego greed hatred and delusion so in this tradition

362
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:47,460
um we we would say and you had asked like is there a way to like diminish the ego or something this tradition points

363
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:53,579
to you don't have to diminish the ego it just recognize that it's actually not

364
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:58,619
there instead in the way that because when we

365
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:04,800
would use maybe like the sense of self as with the ego and so

366
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:12,060
yes it's like 50 50. it's like the 50 percent part like the I I I know about

367
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:18,240
let's say my ego like this introspection but I do not know about

368
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,060
like my environment's ego or like people I am interacting with yeah

369
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:30,000
and how I mean one is of course you know I would want to

370
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,700
be in a like-minded environment so people who are I see am I answering I see I I

371
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:44,940
misunderstood your question so it's easier to not be have greed

372
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:52,500
hatred and delusion when you're surrounded by people that have similar ideas yeah like we were like during

373
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:59,220
um Glenn uh his talk we were talking about you know we talk about Gregory

374
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:05,579
Peck and the Gregory Peck of Indian Cinema and whatnot so if you are like

375
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:12,119
you know thinking good things you know yeah on top of a mountain and you know like that and

376
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:18,060
so it's that ego is down and that's

377
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:25,260
um yeah so a few things like what I said to Anne Rose about the self right is the

378
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:32,880
same about how to like can we would use the the language the self for ego we ego

379
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:39,660
is like a contemporary idea about psychology but um this idea about with like-minded

380
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:44,880
people I agree it's easier but we can't always do that of course and is your

381
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:52,260
question like how can we or where can you or like just very pragmatic like where where and how can we hear because

382
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:57,780
it's like a I mean for me I've been looking for like-minded yeah yeah for

383
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:04,020
like a year more or more and there I I don't want to really call it tiredness

384
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:09,960
um putting effort but it's like you know it's like at some point you want to

385
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:18,060
find an answer to the question yes so here at IMC like on Sundays after

386
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:23,700
the Dharma talk there's discussions and on Wednesdays here there are discussions

387
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:29,339
too so it's an opportunity to kind of explore and meet other people and

388
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:35,579
and yeah and investigate and see if it's a place that supports you bringing your

389
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:42,240
best self forward so to speak thank you yeah thank you

390
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,900
is there a time there's another short question or

391
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,000
um I really liked your analogy about the quail and trying to find the right

392
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,280
amount of energy and effort um what I find in my own life and a lot

393
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:09,540
of my friends is the world today seems to like have too many demands like I'm at an age where we

394
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:16,800
have young children and we still want to have careers and there's um the dream I think is to go about the

395
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:24,960
day you know gently at a gentle Pace but I don't think that it to me it I don't

396
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,540
find that possible because there's too much to do in a day and so I don't know

397
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:38,160
if you have any advice about how to live in a situation

398
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,820
um where it just seems like there's too much to do and they feel like most people's reaction is to like go really

399
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:50,579
fast and then get exhausted and then oversleep you know like doing too much and then too little and then you get

400
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:57,359
into this cycle it would be great to just go at a steady pace and feel like you have enough time in a day to tend to

401
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:02,460
everything like a gentle Gardener but that's that's not you know I to me

402
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:09,420
that's not realistic right now so if we sort of can't have that what's like the next best yeah yeah no this is a

403
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:15,780
legitimate question right so is there there is a way and this is

404
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:25,800
not easy but it's absolutely possible I promise you to have to be uh doing lots of things

405
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:32,819
without tension to be doing one thing after the other

406
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:40,980
but without tension and this is what your point is like it's the dream right it is possible but part of it is to

407
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:46,680
learn what does it feel like when tension is there to feel when there's this like oh my gosh I have to do this

408
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:52,980
and sometimes it's I'll get back to saying this idea this a strong sense of self gets created what's going to happen

409
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:59,640
if I turn this in late I'm going to be the person who turned it in late or something like this but can there be

410
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,920
this recognition without a contraction and a

411
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:11,220
tension the shoulders going up type of thing and I would say one is to recognize when

412
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:16,740
there is tension and to imitation practice actually does help because it kind of

413
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:22,740
um not only is an opportunity to settle but it allows the mind to get used to or

414
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:28,220
recognize when there is some more spaciousness and Once the mind

415
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:34,619
recognizes and sometimes the body that oh there is an alternative to the usual

416
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:43,079
way of doing things it becomes easier to make a change but if you don't have any experience of

417
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,900
doing things in a without tension maybe quickly and a lot of things but no

418
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:56,640
tension then it's hard to do so meditation practice can help I I wish I had an easy answer right you

419
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:03,660
know but at least you have an answer thank you you're welcome you're welcome

420
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:11,359
okay so we're at the top of the hour so thank you will and again Happy New Year
