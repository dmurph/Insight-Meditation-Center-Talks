00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,960
so hello to everyone from redwood city here at the inside meditation center

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,199
and uh i would like to uh do this meditation beginning of this

3
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:30,800
meditation a little bit differently than usual and in that i would like to um

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,680
do a little guided imagery to begin using an analogy that i very i've used many times for some of

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,719
you and i'm very fond of and uh um

6
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,600
just to take a couple of minutes if you would just you know maybe you can be comfortable if you'd like maybe in meditation posture

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,160
and close your eyes and and maybe just to settle in just breathe

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:05,840
a few moments maybe breathe deeply a few moments relax your body

9
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,840
settle in a bit

10
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:25,520
and then to imagine yourself sitting

11
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,360
against the trunk of a tree maybe or some other comfortable place next to

12
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,200
a river and perhaps you've

13
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,280
have a day off maybe you've gone for a nice walk there's nothing you need to do and

14
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,799
things are taken care of well enough in your life that you just sit there in a

15
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:58,479
comfortable afternoon weather and maybe in the shade or

16
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,719
and uh watch the river watch the current and the flow of the

17
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:11,039
water the movements of little wavelets

18
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:22,800
you're watching the flow and ongoing and it's in some ways ever changing

19
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:33,120
and forever changing a constant constancy of inconstancy change the flow

20
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:41,519
sometimes some leaves are floating on the river and float down along

21
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:49,760
sometimes the twig sometimes a boat

22
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,319
sometimes a duck floats down the river

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,879
and you're just observing gazing at this just taking everything in but not really

24
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:12,640
studying anything not staring at anything just relaxed and

25
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,680
present and you let your thoughts do what they do there's no censoring yourself

26
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,280
but there's also no big involvement with your thoughts and particular interest in them and because

27
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,640
everything feels good and easy relaxed just as nice just nice to be

28
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,080
here gazing at the river

29
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,560
and this idea of just sitting observing watching gazing

30
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,599
gently relaxedly at some point in meditation

31
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,519
when we're established well enough

32
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,920
in the present moment we've kind of done what needs to be done

33
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,560
and we can just sit back and allow the practice to unfold

34
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:18,320
by by observing watching allowing

35
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,479
ourselves to be aware of all the changing phenomena in our

36
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,400
body the river of life that is a constantly

37
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:37,120
shifting and changing panorama of sensations

38
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:46,720
perceptions thoughts feelings even if something stays for a while

39
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,160
you might try um

40
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:03,120
to just stay and watching the flow

41
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,840
and one of the places to do that is in your breathing

42
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,720
the breathing there is kind of like a

43
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,840
kind of like in in the way the river is it's a constant

44
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:35,759
flow of inconstancy in that each in-breath comes and goes

45
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,560
flowing into the out breath

46
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,560
there's a beginning of the in-breath middle and an end

47
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,320
the beginning middle and end of the exhale

48
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:07,039
and all that can be felt as sensations in the body so it's not so much

49
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,479
observing the breath as it is observing

50
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,560
the kaleidoscope of changing sensations in your body as you breathe

51
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,919
settling back relaxing as if you're leaning against a tree

52
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,479
watching a river observing

53
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,840
how the sensations are breathing

54
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:48,400
go on and on they arise and they pass

55
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:56,639
some of them spark into existence for a moment and then vanish

56
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,000
like a little wavelet on a river that is there for a moment and then

57
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,199
returns to the river

58
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,638
and to settle further into this watching breathing

59
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:28,160
take a few moments to relax your body more softening all over

60
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:44,720
as if you're relaxing the whole body in towards the breathing

61
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:53,599
relaxing so that the body becomes a soft foundation

62
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,840
for a soft

63
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,360
river of changing sensations

64
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,440
and the more relaxed the body is the more the body's

65
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:23,599
flows and changes and things come and go arise and pass

66
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:33,758
the more tense we are we have the illusion of things being tight and constant continuous

67
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,360
relaxing softening the body settling in

68
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,839
and then again

69
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,519
gazing kindly on your breathing

70
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,080
being sensitive to the aspects of breathing that are

71
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:18,240
constantly changing the sensations of breath that come and go that one morphs into

72
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,839
the other

73
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,720
relaxing the mind the more relaxed the mind is the more it

74
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:19,120
can be part of the flow of the river

75
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,440
the more tense the mind is the more it tends to produce the illusion of

76
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:33,839
constancy of something of being unchanging

77
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:44,880
softening the thinking mind resting in the mind's ability

78
00:10:44,880 --> 00:11:01,839
to observe to perceive to sense experience

79
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:33,200
centered on your breathing all around it is also change

80
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,800
the changing fluxing sensations of your body

81
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,560
the changing experiences that come into awareness

82
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,839
sometimes this sometimes that

83
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,639
wherever there is change changing sensations experience

84
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,480
relax with it open with it

85
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,959
allow it as if you're allowing it

86
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,600
to relax you open you further

87
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,839
as if this anything that changes that comes and goes

88
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:45,839
freeze the mind further as the mind lets it pass through

89
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
so

90
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:24,000
change is an attribute of the present moment

91
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,760
the present moment itself is constantly changing

92
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,799
in more ways than we usually notice

93
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:45,440
settle back and observe how it is that the present moment is a

94
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:54,320
constantly shifting and changing phenomena represented most by the breathing

95
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,840
the body's experience of change as you breathe

96
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,360
relax into the river of change

97
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:11,840
float on all the changing aspects of the present moment

98
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,279
sometimes we're resting in the change observing it

99
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:52,480
and sometimes we're swept away in it our thoughts are also always changing

100
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:00,400
even if even if the same theme persists and sometimes we get carried away in the

101
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,679
flood of thoughts

102
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,200
and the idea is to come back to the

103
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:24,880
to on the ground of the body and from there observe the change

104
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:39,840
in the present

105
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,320
sitting quietly observing change

106
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,000
gaze upon all things kindly

107
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,919
to the best of your ability in a simple maybe even

108
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:40,000
unremarkable way gaze upon all things kindly

109
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,960
and the ability to do so has a lot to do with the ability to be

110
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,320
confident in resting in awareness

111
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:03,200
feeling safe to rest here in awareness

112
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,320
in this print from the safety of being aware

113
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,840
to gaze upon all things kindly

114
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:31,840
to gaze upon all change in a compassionate way

115
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:48,880
those who understand how things are constantly changing

116
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:56,480
are less surprised that things go and things come that

117
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,960
things change and being less surprised

118
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:12,159
there is more space to be kind

119
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:26,240
to have good will and generosity and compassion for this world of ours

120
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:34,000
may it be that our meditation practice together

121
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:45,278
allows us to enter into the world with gift bestowing hands

122
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,200
enter into the world

123
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:59,120
with a orientation that's kind and supportive and friendly

124
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,840
compassionate we have these beautiful qualities of

125
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:13,440
heart that can flow more easily the more we

126
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:21,520
rest in change may all beings

127
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:28,559
be happy may all beings be

128
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:37,520
safe may all beings

129
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,480
be peaceful

130
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,080
may all beings everywhere be

131
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
free

132
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
uh
