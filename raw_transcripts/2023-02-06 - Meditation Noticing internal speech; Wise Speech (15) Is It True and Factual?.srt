80
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:00,620
thanks everyone for your practice

81
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:17,840
so for the

82
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:24,480
Reflections today as I mentioned for today and for this week I'd like to

83
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:33,019
uh share teachings on wise speech

84
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:38,460
which is a very important part of the Eightfold Path

85
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:44,760
and as I briefly mentioned even if we don't get the chance to to uh perhaps

86
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,100
sit in a particular day have a formal setting formal meditation

87
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:57,480
practice we pretty much every day engage with speech either externally

88
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,760
with others or internally the way we talk to ourselves the way we treat

89
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:10,020
ourselves so speech is always happening internally

90
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:16,440
um at least if not externally and

91
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,840
speech forms are

92
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,059
our personality forms our mind forms the person

93
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:33,480
who we are who we become and sometimes actually our speech may not correspond

94
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,760
to uh who we think we are and

95
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:45,720
um and through actually through cultivating wise speech we can

96
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,299
um as a formal practice taking it on as a formal practice

97
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:56,460
not as a yeah yeah yeah I'm truthful enough but no actually taking it as a

98
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:02,460
formal practice we can really engage in shape and and support our development

99
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:08,940
it's it's it's a beautiful and I don't want to make it tight serious but it's

100
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:15,480
it's it's a profound practice why speech is a profound practice

101
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:22,260
really profound in shaping who we are what we are so

102
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:28,980
there are various there's definitions for what wise speech for uh what why

103
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:39,240
speech is and the Buddha also teaches about um or ways to questions to ask ourselves

104
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,120
and this week I will go through them all um and through multiple lists the Buddha

105
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:53,460
has different lists and if you combine those different lists what one list has four definitions and one has five and if

106
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,860
you combine them we end up with actually six guidelines six questions to ask

107
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:04,980
ourselves um and I'll combine given that we have five days in the week I'll come one day

108
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:10,140
I'll cover two of them so that we can cover all five all six

109
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:16,980
so um actually first I want to say one more thing about uh speech um so in the

110
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:24,840
Eightfold Path uh why speech shows up pretty much right

111
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,179
after wise perspective or wise View and wise

112
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:35,580
intention so of course the root of everything is our perspective how we see

113
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,679
something how how what our view of the world is our wise view wise perspective

114
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:46,440
and then Our intention coming having make forming an intention for action and

115
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,720
then the third one is why speech so it's really right after the the first two

116
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,760
basic fundamental Holdings you know what everything what what holds the whole

117
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:02,279
practice up is really our view our perspective our perception and

118
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:09,240
um and Our intention our Compass have what we said our compass compass to be

119
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:14,520
so with why speech

120
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:21,780
in order to practice it I would say two general um uh directions that will apply to

121
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:27,540
every question that we'll we'll cover this week first is to actually make a commitment

122
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:33,960
make a commitment to engaging with why speeches making a commitment so that

123
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:40,440
commitment is the the second path Factor wise intention intending this is what

124
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:47,820
I'm going to do I'm going to engage to speak skillfully appropriately

125
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:53,820
not gossip not lie not be unkind

126
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,040
etc etc and we'll go through them so first is really the intention we make

127
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,260
at the outset and then later in real time as we're actually speaking you

128
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:12,720
pause we feel into our bodies if we are um about to shape the truth or let's

129
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:20,339
tell a white lie or or gossip feeling into our bodies what's going on am I

130
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:25,920
stressed do I feel threatened am I trying to self-aggrandize

131
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,800
feeling into the body of sweetheart yeah interesting that's what's going on okay

132
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:38,240
and can we reconnect with Our intention can we reconnect with Our intention

133
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:44,099
so these are the basic ways to engage

134
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:50,940
and then one more thing to say about the tri um in Pali in the Eightfold Path

135
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:59,940
um appropriate speech or why speech is Sama vacha Sama vacha and the word Sama is

136
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:06,839
sometimes translated as a right right speech uh why speech appropriate speech and

137
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:13,740
early in my practice when I heard right it's it sounded so Puritan right speaking wrong speak whereas actually

138
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:21,180
the word summer really means appropriate as in using the appropriate tool so for

139
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:28,859
example the appropriate tool for hitting the Bell is is the you know the Bell Striker uh it's not a pen or a mug it's

140
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:34,079
the appropriate tool so what's the appropriate speech what is the right appropriate

141
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,240
um or wise uh Speech in a given situation

142
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:46,479
foreign [Music]

143
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:53,220
right so okay so

144
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:59,400
today I like to cover the first um in the time remaining there's so much

145
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:05,040
I want to say but um the for the first guideline really is

146
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:11,180
um is it truthful is it true and factual

147
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:17,400
and truthfulness is the only

148
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:24,079
[Music] um um moral commitment really is the the

149
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:31,260
commitment to truthfulness it is said that in the progression of a

150
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:38,339
bodhisattva uh from going through many many many many lifetimes uh to become a

151
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:44,460
full Buddha the bodhisattva uh truthfulness the commitment to the truth

152
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:50,579
is so important that that's the only moral precept that a bodhisattva cannot

153
00:37:50,579 --> 00:38:00,000
and does not uh break so so this not only symbolically but um but

154
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,900
this the sense that our commitment to the truth really is the foundation of the whole path it's a really Foundation

155
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:12,480
of our Awakening um in in our Humanity through many many

156
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,140
lifetimes if we have a funny relationship to the truth yeah that's is

157
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:25,560
our commitment to Awakening is a little not quite straightforward so so so the

158
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:32,839
commitment to truthfulness to truthfulness and the Buddha talked about how

159
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:41,099
dangerous it is actually how lying is dangerous because it it has leads to a

160
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:50,339
slippery slope of more um lying more complicated behaviors you

161
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:58,260
have to tell more lies to cover the first one and and more moral corruptitude and actually there is

162
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:05,820
um there is research that supports that and what before I tell you about the research which is actually fascinating

163
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:11,700
um also I wanted to mention that as we know when we tell a lie

164
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:18,660
um it it really um uh betrays trust it betrays trust in

165
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:26,820
relationship and others have trouble trusting us later as Nietzsche said I'm

166
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:34,380
not upset that you lied to me I'm upset that from now on I can't believe you

167
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:40,440
very powerful words so

168
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:49,740
so I want to tell you about a um daddy that's fascinating so in the study

169
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:57,900
um and I'll tell a very brief version here basically um the researchers wanted to study lying

170
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:05,339
and how uh can progress how it can impact the the brain Etc so they made up

171
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:14,040
they created a setup a a situation uh where the subjects were tempted to

172
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:21,780
lie or tempted to lie just a little bit to get some um uh Financial reward which was again

173
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:27,359
tiny so at first the participants lied a little

174
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,520
bit they exaggerated a tiny bit they had to estimate the number of pennies in a

175
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:39,839
jar etc etc won't get into the complicated setup um so at first they they upped it just a

176
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:47,820
little bit a tiny bit and when they opted a little bit their

177
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:54,060
amygdala the amygdala part of the brain that really is is is

178
00:40:54,060 --> 00:41:00,780
um it is said to be the alarm uh uh part of the alarm network of the brain you

179
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:07,740
know fear and and and also this so so there was a sense of oh a discomfort like ah the amygdala would engage when

180
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:14,160
when people lied a little bit like okay this is I don't want to lie but I did like uncomfortable there's a sense of

181
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:22,819
discomfort in the body yeah as the experiment progressed

182
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:30,359
well people when people have had lied their light their lies became bigger bigger and bigger and so that by the end

183
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:37,200
of the experiment they were just widely overestimating the number of the pennies by more than if you know 50 or so just

184
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:44,400
it's snowballed really lying snowballed but what's amazing actually is that

185
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,220
they're amygdala became less reactive

186
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:54,900
that's profound so their body didn't feel as comfortable they didn't

187
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:00,359
feel as uncomfortable lying anymore they had trained their bodies they had

188
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:07,140
trained their heart they had trained their minds they had trained themselves to feel more comfortable with lying

189
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:13,740
and they had changed through their behavior

190
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:21,119
they had changed their Compass because our bodies are in many ways our moral compass have you

191
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:27,180
decide have you figured that you know with mindfulness of the body we feel into what's happening in the body and

192
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:32,880
really it's our Arts are it's our tuning fork it's our tuning fork but through

193
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,700
our actions we can shape and form our bodies to become either less or more

194
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:45,420
sensitive to our moral conduct to our Awakening towards us we can become more and less

195
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:52,619
sensitive to our Humanity to our goodness wow that

196
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:58,859
is astounding and and not surprising right we know that

197
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:06,359
um so so commitment to truthfulness really is is is is Paramount really the

198
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:12,720
first and foremost of these of why speech invitation and I

199
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:20,160
also want to um mention that um in samsutas it's not just is it true

200
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:27,839
the question to ask ourselves um what I'm about to say is it true is it true what I'm about to say it's actually is

201
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:35,579
it true and factual so that Nuance of is it factual is

202
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:45,119
actually is a very important Nuance so so the truth is not relative it's not my

203
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:54,300
truth it's your truth because yes we all have our perceptions and perspectives but the Buddha suggests that we actually

204
00:43:54,300 --> 00:44:00,720
um examine is is it supportable is is this what what I consider to be the truth is

205
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:08,060
this supportable by facts oh this person is mean they they meant to hurt me

206
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:13,440
wait a minute are we attributing or is it really supported by facts is it just

207
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,500
our perceptions our feelings yes it is true we were hurt yes we can say that

208
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:25,560
but can we attribute uh intentionality or is it that okay well they said this I

209
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:33,960
said that this is so it's like a third person conversation essentially you know they're in in actually um

210
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,119
there's one book that I love and highly recommend is difficult conversations and

211
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:45,900
in whenever you're about what you need to have and we need to have difficult conversations in our lives a lot

212
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:51,119
of course not they may not necessarily be difficult but but you know impactful

213
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:58,319
conversation and for example in this book really which to me is a beautiful Dharma book talks about how uh we

214
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:04,260
separate our the impact that something has had in us from the intentionality so

215
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:10,140
one part of the conversation is okay why do we perceive something to be and then we can put ourselves in the other

216
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:16,500
person's shoes what we perceive things to happen from their perspective and then there is a third person

217
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:22,020
conversation which is the objective just just objectively what happened they said

218
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:27,359
that I said this they did that just very simple without any interpretation

219
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:36,240
without any attribution of intentionality just it's it's objective objective so so this um

220
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,400
uh edition of is it true and factual is [Music]

221
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:49,440
um uh is it is a very important Nuance that that the Buddha the brilliant Buddha uh

222
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:57,180
ads okay a lot more to say um happy to be practicing together and

223
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:04,200
sharing the Dharma take good care have a wonderful day and looking forward to

224
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,760
continuing tomorrow be well
