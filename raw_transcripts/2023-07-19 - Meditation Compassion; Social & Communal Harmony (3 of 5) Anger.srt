1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,740
a good day good morning if you're here on the West Coast

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,380
hoping you're well

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,439
so again my name is kodo and

4
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:29,720
we'll continue today with this theme of the Buddha's teachings on social and communal Harmony

5
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:41,760
the first day in the meditation we just grounded ourselves sort of stealing inviting a sense of ease and samadhi and

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,980
settledness yesterday in the meditation we moved to

7
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,300
meta loving-kindness practice and today we'll turn to compassion

8
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,878
so we'll start in much the same way

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,680
settling collecting and then a few minutes into the meditation there will

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,720
be a shift and we'll move to arousing compassion

11
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,560
so let's find our postures

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,659
whether you're seated or reclining

13
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,020
or standing

14
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,400
or walking

15
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:55,520
how can you invite some alignment into the bones

16
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,298
balance on the muscles

17
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,680
and letting the breath reveal where there may be places of tension or

18
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,099
holding

19
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,200
foreign letting the breath help us relax

20
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,379
bringing Just a Touch of energy into the physical body

21
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:18,200
maybe that means lengthening the spine just a little

22
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,400
balancing ease and energy

23
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:15,979
breathing breathing through this whole body

24
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,660
for now centering the attention

25
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,080
on the sensations of breathing

26
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,160
foreign

27
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,500
foreign

28
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,060
now within the meditation

29
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,660
without too much inner movement the shift

30
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:36,300
the shift to arousing compassion

31
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,860
which we'll try this way

32
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,779
as in the sitting yesterday we'll first arouse

33
00:10:54,779 --> 00:11:01,200
meta good well loving kindness for ourselves

34
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,300
in whatever way feels natural for you

35
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,300
intending our own well-being

36
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,200
that feeling and the whole body and mind

37
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:24,380
feeling the wish may I be happy

38
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:39,800
may I be happy

39
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,240
with just the beginnings of meta

40
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:12,079
when meta meets suffering the response is compassion

41
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,700
we can turn this wish for well-being

42
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,260
towards someone who's suffering

43
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,760
could be us someone we know

44
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,540
do you mean draw this person up in mind

45
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,220
sense what it's like to be with them

46
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:07,339
in the same movement of the heart offering the wish

47
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,700
may you be happy

48
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,300
may you be free from suffering

49
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,560
may you be freed from harm and affliction

50
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:09,180
as we offer this wish our center of gravity

51
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:16,940
stays in the wish for well-being may you be happy

52
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,339
may you be free from suffering

53
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,240
may be safe from harm and affliction

54
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,920
foreign

55
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:31,680
foreign gently

56
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:35,540
this compassion

57
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,940
inviting it to well up in the heart

58
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,380
with the wish may you be free from suffering

59
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,620

61
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,559
and welling up

62
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:32,840
compassion can be like that amber light at Sunset

63
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:40,100
shining from within us

64
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,840
now we can offer this compassion to all beings

65
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,019
to all beings experience suffering

66
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,860
first in the direction in front of us

67
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:13,980
as if there were a curtain in front of us shielding the light of

68
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,900
compassion from shining forth

69
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:25,340
gently but swiftly draw back the curtain

70
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:34,580
and let this light of compassion shine on all beings to the forward Direction

71
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:42,620
may all of you be free of suffering

72
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,260
now all beings in the quarter to the right

73
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,120
throwing back the curtain swiftly

74
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:46,740
and letting the amber light of compassion shine all beings may you be free

75
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,120
from harm and affliction

76
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,460
now in the third Direction behind

77
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:13,520
uncovering the light of compassion swiftly drawing back the curtain

78
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:22,220
may all beings behind be free from suffering

foreign [Music]

92
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,158
relaxing back into ease

93
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,100
relaxing any effort in the method

94

to register any goodness that's come

95
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,380
maybe and all beings

96

be equally nourished by this goodness

foreign [Music]

98
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:32,778
um hello again

99
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,659
just having a moment to transition

100
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,860
it may be in the transition to say thank you so much for your practice

101
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,159
it's no small thing

102
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:08,279
so social and communal Harmony my brother's teachings to recap a bit where we've been

103
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:14,700
what we're talking about is that the practice of Social and communal Harmony and the Buddhist teachings begins with

104
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,740
Right View it's this understanding of the efficacy

105
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:26,820
of our action and then yesterday we discussed how the

106
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:32,159
Right View is Made Real by our effort by our Endeavor in personal training

107
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:40,440
we talked about rahula's repeated reflection and then for many of us sooner or later

108
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,080
will encounter a state that challenges Us in some important ways

109
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:53,340
and I think is especially relevant when we're we're considering social and communal Harmony

110
00:31:53,340 --> 00:32:03,320
how to live and act in a harmonious way with others and that state that emotion is anger

111
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:12,360
let's start with this short story from the suttas it features um features someone named

112
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,760
sakka uh the the texts say that sakka was the

113
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,039
the ruler of the heavens of the 33 and it's uh likened kind of more to um

114
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:29,820
Regional ruler than a monarch interestingly characterized as imperfect

115
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:36,740
but someone of great faith and devotion so suck uh

116
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:42,659
uh approached the Buddha and the usual usual approach paid his

117
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:49,559
respects stood to one side and then he said this having slain what

118
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:57,240
does one sleep soundly having slain what does one not sorrow

119
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:04,279
what is the one thing ogotama who's killing you approve

120
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:12,120
the Buddha responds having slain anger one sleeps soundly

121
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:19,140
having slain anger one does not sorrow the killing of anger Osaka

122
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:24,960
with its poisoned root and honey tip this is the killing the noble ones

123
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,559
praise for having slain that one does not sorrow

124
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,500
it's a rather provocative turn of conversation I never hear the Buddha talking of

125
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:44,100
killing I think this was for rhetorical effect and we'll add some qualifications first

126
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:51,360
about [Music] um uh anger and the first thing is that um in the

127
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:58,799
way Guild translates or distinguishes this makes them makes a clear line between

128
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:05,940
anger and hostility in Anger we can take that's just good

129
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:11,099
information that's good information from our system something that may be saying oh this is

130
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:17,099
important to me or I have a boundary here that that needs respecting

131
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:23,300
so anger can be good information for us it's useful not to be slain

132
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:30,358
and so the guild will translate the word here that the Kubota was translating as anger as hostility

133
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:35,638
which has something of the edge of the impulse to arm or cruelty

134
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:43,138
the opposite of this compassion practice we were just doing for all sorts of Anger of course stay

135
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:49,020
for longer or shorter times one that's particularly sticky

136
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:55,858
I think for many of us a form of anger a form of hostility that can linger is resentment

137
00:34:55,859 --> 00:35:01,680
and there's a there's an interesting suit on the angutura nikaya where the

138
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:09,119
Buddha talks the Buddha talks about nine variations on how resentment is conditioned by our thinking

139
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,820
and in that teaching more or less it's uh it's ways that we rehearse and

140
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:20,220
re-rehearse and re-rehearse this other person did harm to me or my

141
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:26,180
loved ones or they're supporting my uh foes

142
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,880
there's this really great expression in English nursing a grudge but we're

143
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,078
feeding a hostility

144
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:44,280
I think there's a clue to how hostilities harmful to us in the in the teachings that said that hostility is

145
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:50,760
what an enemy would wish for us and I have to wonder after our first

146
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,820
couple of days of teaching is rahula's repeated reflection even possible

147
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:03,599
when we're heavily under this way of hostility do we have the presence of mind to be

148
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:09,240
able to reflect is the action I'm about to take um harmful

149
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:14,520
is it helpful is it cause for affliction for myself

150
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:20,280
for others or for both or is it for our well-being it's challenging to do this when we're

151
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,380
under this way of hostility the poison root and honey tip has such a

152
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:30,540
an influence we're encouraged to be circumspect of

153
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:36,800
course in the interest of our own welfare and social and communal Harmony

154
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:46,500
so a story I'm about to tell I think I think without mentioning it is pointing to what I think of as the missing piece

155
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:54,319
when it comes to play to uh practicing with hostility and that is our practice of mindfulness of emotions

156
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,880
now I when I was quite young I learned how to I learned how to drive on an old

157
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,220
Volkswagen Bug just like tan Volkswagen from the 1970s

158
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:10,859
and young me I was sort of amazed at the power of the clutch

159
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:16,800
and up until then I had I thought there was this direct relationship you press the gas and the car goes

160
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,680
so just one to one anytime there's gas the car is going to move if the engine is running

161
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:29,760
so it was it was fascinating for me to realize that if I press the clutch down

162
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:37,619
while the engine is moving I could rev rev rev rev rev the engine and no matter how much gas it got however loud it got

163
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:43,440
the wheels didn't turn it didn't move the car didn't move

164
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:51,960
I think in just the same way our mindfulness practice when it comes to strong emotions like hostility anger

165
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:58,920
our mindfulness practice can act as the clutch it actually uh the emotion the

166
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,579
information of anger can rev up through the body and with with this practice of

167
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:11,099
mindfulness we can allow that we can allow that revving let's say

168
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:17,339
to come through as loud as it wants to get and pass right through

169
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:22,980
and we don't in we don't move we don't go into Movement we don't engage if we

170
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:29,599
let go of the clutch something else might happen but to feel our emotions through the body

171
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,240
I think this might have been what was happening during this other story with the Buddha there's

172
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:44,700
a time that he's at the squirrel sanctuary and someone someone comes to him named bharadwaja the rude

173
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:50,040
and it's said that Bharat vaja had found out that someone in his cast had gone

174
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:56,400
forth into um he'd become a monk a student of the Buddha

175
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,839
so the Bharat vaja comes to the buddhanis it says angry and displeased he went to the Buddha and abused and

176
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,599
insulted him with rude harsh words and when he'd spoke in the Buddha said

177
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:17,099
to him rather this is amazing to me rather than the Buddha uh more or less taking the

178
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:23,460
bait returning insult with insult he does this

179
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:28,859
he says to bhardwaja what do you think do friends and colleagues and relatives

180
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:34,560
and family members do they come and visit you and Barbara responds yes sometimes they

181
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,320
do do you then serve them fresh and cooked

182
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:47,060
foods and savories they would ask sometimes I do

183
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:56,240
but if they don't accept it who does that food belong to in that case it belongs to me says

184
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:05,880
the Buddha says in the same way when you abuse harass and attack us who

185
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:12,359
do not abuse harass and attack we don't accept it it still belongs to you

186
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:20,060
it still belongs to you someone who he says when abused harassed and attacked

187
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:25,920
abuses harasses and attacks in return is said to eat to the food and have a

188
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,140
reaction to it but we neither eat your food nor do we

189
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:38,400
have a reaction to it it still belongs to you it still belongs to you I don't know if you can imagine this but

190
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:45,119
someone someone coming forward with with um an insult with hostility

191
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:51,420
and having the presence of mind that uh that reflection that moment of pause

192
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:57,359
that push of the clutch that allows allows their strong energy to come to

193
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:03,420
you and then we have the moment of pause and reflection and choice

194
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:10,079
to decide how to engage it's not automatic that we meet insult with insult and in this case the Buddha

195
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:17,359
is kindly kindly explaining that those insults

196
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:23,420
can keep them they're not his

197
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:33,660
so in the Buddha's sort of keen analysis in other places he talks about various causes of anger hostility and resentment

198
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:38,820
some of them are things like Envy stinginess some of them are linked to

199
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:44,220
craving and seeking and attachment and some of them are are linked to views

200
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:50,099
or strongholdings of opinions but there are these wise ways that I

201
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:55,680
think we start to encounter um how to live

202
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,020
with the very human impulse to anger how to

203
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:06,260
respond to it in others and I think we can base what will become

204
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:12,180
a full rich functioning practice in rahula's

205
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:19,200
repeated reflection knowing before during and after is this action I'm about to take helpful

206
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,338
is it harmful

207
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:31,859
so in another teaching again says when I'm angry I don't speak harshly

208
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:37,320
and I don't praise my virtues I keep myself well restrained out of

209
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:44,060
regard for my own good I keep myself well restrained

210
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:51,599
many other teachings on anger and I want to mention something about some other practices so we have rahula's repeated

211
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,760
reflection we have our practice of mindfulness of emotions of course

212
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:02,099
and then the maybe a third set that I want to I want to mention is something

213
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:10,500
we did earlier actually the inspiration for the meditations this week inasuta on ways of removing resentment

214
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:17,160
three of them are three of the Brahma viharas we can take up the practice of loving

215
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:22,560
kindness the practice of compassion The Compassion the the practice of

216
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:28,200
equanimity and in a sort of way condition our affective responses

217
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:34,980
so that we can live in a harmonious way as best we can I like to think of this this inner inner

218
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:41,520
cultivation this training of our affect is kind of like giving our giving our

219
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,160
um giving our heart and mind a number of options well-practiced options so that when

220
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:52,200
we're under pressure these um things like kindness and compassion

221
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:59,040
present themselves so to close for today I'll just say

222
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:05,400
in exploring and dealing with anger we can make an effort to get close to it

223
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:12,599
through repeated reflection and there are distinctions to be made that show us that anger isn't the lump

224
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:19,460
it too is made of conditions it's varied and our vision of it is such

225
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:24,260
that it undermines anger's enchantment

226
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,640
as with the other aspects of the personal training

227
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:36,200
we interrogate anger's causes and effects through repeated reflection

228
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:45,000
hmm so even with anger hostility

229
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,180
very human aspects of our experience we practice with these diligently and we

230
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:58,619
find ways to be with them we discover them for ourselves how to live with these

231
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:06,020
in a way that's of benefit to ourselves a benefit to others and a benefit to everyone

232
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:13,560
this is this is what practice is asking of us tomorrow we'll move on to good

233
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:21,420
friendship and mutual benefit May our practice together this morning

234
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,819
nourish us and may it be that our Reflections our

235
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:32,160
meditation our faith in the Buddhist path [Music]

236
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:38,040

237
