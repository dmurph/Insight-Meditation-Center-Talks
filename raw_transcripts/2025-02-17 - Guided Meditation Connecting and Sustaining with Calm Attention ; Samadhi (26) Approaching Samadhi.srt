1
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:08,440
so good morning and welcome and

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:16,039
uh so for these weeks now idea is to slowly put together the

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,840
pieces the little steps to understand and to practice

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,359
samadi and um to give it's not really possible to in a

5
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:33,879
short time to give all the instructions that would really help understand the

6
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:42,320
elements of suadi practice and so to go through it really slowly and uh some of you might from

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,480
time to time be able to follow along uh closely to the instructions or

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,680
the guidance in one day and some of you won't and that's okay uh the idea is

9
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:01,160
take it in anyway and um don't uh uh um kind of

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,759
write it off because maybe you're agitated today uh or

11
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:14,400
something uh follow along the best you can maybe even with your imagination maybe even remembering a

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,240
time in your life where something like this was the case and uh so you have some it somehow

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,240
begins to register deeply so it's ready in meditation when it becomes relevant

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,360
for you so so today what I'm going to do is to say a few

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,360
words do a little guided kind of meditation to start us off and then do a

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,560
little exercise uh that involves opening the eyes and then closing the eyes again and

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,759
then getting started and so two things first that uh

18
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,920
the topic of pleasure last week was very important because we're using the simp

19
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,399
symptoms of of things going well in meditation the benefits of it as a kind

20
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,840
of as a as a funnel or as a helping us

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,959
gather and keep us in the practice and with time there's a direct feedback loop

22
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,800
between really being settled on an object of samade and and the strengthening of

23
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,080
those symptoms and um and uh whatever we're

24
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,080
doing with our mind and maybe our body whatever attitudes we have they'll have

25
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,840
a influence on the rest of us so if we spend a lot of time angry

26
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,519
there'll be symptoms of that in the body and chances are they're uncomfortable and those uncomfortable

27
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,000
Sensations then maybe subconsciously predispose us to feel

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,760
feel kind of unhappy about what's happening to us and so there's an uncons conscious subconscious kind of reaction

29
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,840
response feedback loop we get into we the anger makes us uncomfortable the discomfort makes us me more angry and so

30
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,720
it goes and often this kind of feedback loop goes

31
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,599
unrecognized in Sade we're using that feedback loop to feel the pleasure the

32
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:28,519
goodness of it just enough to stay focused and that uh the focus is not to

33
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:36,560
hold attention fixed mied but rather there's a gentle um the ancient text

34
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,560
talk about taking a nice soft cloth and putting against a brass Bowl putting it

35
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,200
there and then rubbing it cleaning it so these two steps placing there and then

36
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:54,959
gently rubbing it or a bird that's going to fly will flap its wings kind of

37
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:03,040
strongly to get up or is flying maybe but needs to kind of soar a little bit higher will flap its wings and then soar

38
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,560
flap its wings and soar and uh this is called um applied

39
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:16,720
and sustained attention that very gently there's a kind of returning to the breath staying

40
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,600
on it surfing on it stay sustaining attention there and then there'll be a

41
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,720
reapplying of that reapplication of attention we're not just holding our attention mention

42
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:38,320
there and uh but there's a relaxed soft kind of massage in a sense

43
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:46,120
touching kneading touching kneading touching petting touching petting that

44
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,680
we do and this is called in p vaka and vichara so these two things the feedback

45
00:04:52,680 --> 00:05:00,400
loop and this kind of this application of attention and sustaining it where that massage is what

46
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,479
is part of what's keeping the the symptoms the pleasure the well-being uh

47
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,080
kind of moving it along and sustaining it so I'll do now we'll do the short

48
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,280
kind of settling meditation and then I will do an exercise with the eyes with

49
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,639
looking before we close our eyes again in order to do talk apply

50
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,880
this so to take a meditation posture

51
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,880
and for now gently close your

52
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:50,199
eyes and with your eyes closed take a few gently deeper breaths

53
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:59,400
not too deep comfortably deep and a comfortably long exhale

54
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:10,478
breathing in fully and on the exhale relaxing the

55
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,560
body and then letting your breathing return to

56
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:35,360
normal taking a few moments to feel your Global body the way your body

57
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,599
is grounded or settled in the seat that you're

58
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:45,639
on the surface that's receiving your body

59
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:59,039
weight and as you exhale gently release your body into the pool

60
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,520
of gravity

61
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,560
into being grounded in your seat

62
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:38,840
and then breathing normally relaxing on the exhale relaxing

63
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,160
the

64
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,199
face softening in the shoulders

65
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,479
softening the

66
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,680
belly and then centering yourself on the

67
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,199
breathing Maybe

68
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:38,360
allowing the weight of attention to settle into

69
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,279
the settling place the grounding place of your

70
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,040
breathing maybe at the end of the out breath the very beginning of the INB

71
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,040
breath

72
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,800
and then to do the exercise with the eyes

73
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,959
open your eyes and find a

74
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,320
spot that particular spot that's in front of you where that you can stare on that you

75
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,000
can hold your eyes on that spot

76
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,120
unwavering it's a very small spot and don't let your eyes leave that

77
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:06,000
spot hold your eyes still so it really stays

78
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,240
on the spot and we'll do that for about 15 seconds

79
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:40,079
and notice with your eyes fixed if there's any tension anywhere in your

80
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:48,240
body the shoulders the belly the eyes that comes with that kind of

81
00:10:53,079 --> 00:11:00,639
fixing and now keeping your eyes open

82
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,480
look into space and let your eyes float in the eye

83
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,040
sockets and just kind of let your eyes roam around the room the place you're in

84
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,480
without any purpose without staring at anything just kind of almost like

85
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:29,240
tracing the outlines of things or floating around

86
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:40,040
maybe not even looking at things but almost as if you're not focused on any particular

87
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:46,959
thing but your eyes are roaming around as if you're following the track that

88
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:55,440
the trail of a fly flying around that flies flying very slowly and

89
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:05,040
relaxedly and your eyes just kind of gently do what they want to do no will

90
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:12,360
or no D no intention no directing your eyes just

91
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,959
let them float around the room

92
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:37,240
and now feel your eyes feel your face your body your

93
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:44,120
shoulders is this more relaxed for the eyes to be this way than it was to hold

94
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:51,680
them fixed on a spot and of course it' be different for

95
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,240
different people but a fair number of people find

96
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,480
that fixating fixing their eyes on something is more of a strain than

97
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,000
letting the eyes float and roam

98
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,320
around so the same thing with breathing if we try to fix our attention on

99
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,600
breathing it can become stressful but if we do something equivalent with attention as we did with

100
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,120
our eyes letting attention roam around with the

101
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:36,720
breathing it can be more relaxing so now still with your eyes

102
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,079
open find a relatively small spot not as small as

103
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:50,480
before some object that's that you can and maintain your focus on that object

104
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:59,279
so you're not roaming around with the whole room but in the

105
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,360
within the scope of this object let your eyes

106
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,480
roam looking at it seeing it so you see it with some

107
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:19,839
clarity but the eyes are also relaxedly floating around the object

108
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,519
and now closing your

109
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:52,160
eyes and let your awareness your attention settle on the breathing in out the

110
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,839
movements of the body breathing the sensations of breathing maybe coming and going from

111
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:07,360
your your centering spot for the

112
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:16,560
breathing in the same way let your attention be relaxed and

113
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:24,120
soft but follow Trace roam around within the sensations

114
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,320
of breathing

115
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:55,560
and then there's a settling or placing the attention

116
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:03,920
there again and resting there sustaining this free relaxed floating

117
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,440
attention so you feel and sense clearly the sensations are

118
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:16,360
breathing but there's a feeling of Freedom or ease in the

119
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:30,920
awareness and very gently there is a kind of a

120
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:38,440
reapplying awareness in the transition from breathing in to breathing

121
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:48,199
out from breathing out to breathing in so let there be a soft reapplying

122
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,040
reconnecting a connecting to the in breath when it begins connecting to the

123
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:01,079
out breath when it begins and then sustaining attention in

124
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:07,520
a soft relaxed way if the out INB breath is momentary

125
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:14,400
just let it be like a spark that appears in the night

126
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:22,199
sky if it's longer let it be like

127
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:28,438
a a wave or a river in which you gently

128
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,840
walk

129
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,360
flowing

130
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,600
by and if your attention Slips Away from breathing

131
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,960
see if you can avoid any judgments reactions to that

132
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:13,639
happened just see it as an opportunity to reapply

133
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:22,919
attention to put the cloth back on the edge of the bowl and then to rub

134
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:33,200
it to Flap the wings again and then to glide on the breath

135
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:10,200
and being careful not to try too hard this whole exercise

136
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,720
is just short of doing

137
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,080
nothing mostly

138
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:35,280
it's you're continually returning and opening awareness to the small area where

139
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,960
breathing

140
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,279
predominates maybe breathing is the

141
00:19:51,039 --> 00:20:00,640
cloth and the movement of breathing is the cloth polishing your awareness

142
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,640
for for

143
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,799
sometimes wandering off into thought is a very small movement that takes you

144
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,720
very not very far

145
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,279
away and even if it a small moving away in

146
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:30,519
thought return reconnect to breathing in a relaxed soft

147
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,120
way almost like an act of

148
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:43,158
Love connecting and sustaining attention with

149
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,559
breathing for

150
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:37,159
and if there's any pleasure associated

151
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:45,320
with applying and sustaining connecting and staying with the

152
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:53,158
breathing allow that pleasure to be there

153
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,400
to remind you how good it is to

154
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,360
stay with the breathing with the relaxed soft

155
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,919
attention not fixating

156
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,400
attention almost as if it

157
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:33,240
roams in the particular are area where breathing Sensations

158
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,159
occur or the sensations of breathing roam around in

159
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,559
awareness at the center of being

160
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
aware

161
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

162
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

163
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
for e

164
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:28,799
and then as we come to the end of this sitting imagine your sit sitting on a

165
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:34,960
park bench a nice warm sunny

166
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,158
day gazing upon the

167
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:46,600
trees the birds the Gophers

168
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:53,080
squirrels with a relaxed gaze not fixating on

169
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:58,480
anything not staring but letting your eyes roam

170
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,039
be at ease

171
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:13,159
soft and there are people who come by but in this scenario you feel safe

172
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:22,440
and comfortable and nothing's asked of you and you allow your roaming eyes to

173
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:30,799
gently roam around with the people seeing them in a relax soft

174
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:43,600
way maybe there's no judgments no conclusions about people just soft

175
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,278
and gentle gazing upon the

176
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,679
world and as if this kind of gazing

177
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:08,679
is a vehicle to transmit our good will smile

178
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:15,559
gently smile on the people in your life smile thinking about the people and

179
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:23,679
strangers you might run into today gazing upon them with a relaxed

180
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:32,440
awareness and wish them well let your good will your goodness your

181
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:40,600
kindness travel into this relaxed awareness from you to

182
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:51,279
them as if you touch their hearts with a medicine of

183
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,480
kindness may all beings be

184
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,039
happy may all

185
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:10,639
beings be safe may all beings be

186
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,880
peaceful may all beings be

187
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,320
free and may we all care with care for each other

188
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:35,690
with [Music]

189
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:43,869
[Music]

190
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,679
kindness thank

191
00:29:54,039 --> 00:30:00,640
you so while I drink my water that might be nice helpful for me if

192
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,519
there were some comments about what it was like to do that exercise and that taught you something different about how

193
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:14,600
to be closely attentive to

194
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
breathing

195
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
e e

196
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:55,080
so thank you for those of you chatting about the exercise and

197
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,720
um I'll read U more of them after finished now so welcome to this next

198
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,720
talk on samadi and um and for this week uh we're

199
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,320
going to uh be looking at something that commonly in English is called access

200
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,519
concentration or access sombody though the the word

201
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,600
access uh never really quite s sat well with sits well with

202
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:29,760
me um the word in pachara um my understanding it it means

203
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,919
close something more closely to um uh approach

204
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:41,960
approaching Chara means to wander and to wander towards something and based on

205
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,360
that meditation we just did the idea that the that we attention has a little

206
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,320
bit quality of wandering soft roaming but it's roaming towards a particular

207
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:58,559
place it's moving towards something uh when I think of EX C

208
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:03,639
concentration I think of um like there's a door I have to go

209
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:09,120
through and uh and um but uh but I think

210
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,720
of approach then uh wandering towards approaching then I it's more of a kind

211
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,360
of a gentle movement like a like a river flowing that or I'm in the groove of

212
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,960
something and now I'm gliding along I'm in the slide sliding I'm approaching and

213
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:34,080
we're approaching a a shift that will happen when the samade kind of uh uh

214
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:43,559
Clicks in when the somadi kind of um uh becomes kind of a u uh envelops us or

215
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:49,600
begins to have a life of its own in a sense um uh when we we don't have to

216
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:57,000
make as much effort there's not so much dependent on us practicing but it's more that we're being practiced at some point

217
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,519
but we're approach roing this point where the shift begins to happen and um and there's a number of

218
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:10,240
things that begin coming together uh in this stage the stage called the

219
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,800
approach and um and one of them is that we get in the kind of in the in the

220
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:23,280
Rhythm or in the with a sense of ease with um uh these two uh factors of

221
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,638
samade which is connecting attention and sustaining attention

222
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,919
and um uh the awareness that places

223
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,878
attention and the awareness that stays there uh some people emphasize that

224
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:44,960
sometimes that involves a little bit of very rudimentary thought that the

225
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,480
thought is oh come back to the breathing and the thought that kind of kind of

226
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,720
begins to feel and sense what's going on know it more cck carefully oh that's a

227
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:01,960
smooth inhale that's a smooth out tail that's a a step by step inhale just

228
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:09,839
moves inhale goes up up up in kind of steps or that's smooth that's Pleasant

229
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:17,079
so it's not so conscious the thoughts but exactly they consciously done but there can be very simple uh kind of

230
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:27,960
thinking that keeps us in the flow of it and um and so um and the um the class

231
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,400
analogy that we'll review talk about again later is uh is

232
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,599
Akin uh to in the modern world uh mixing

233
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:45,920
uh water into flour to make dough where we start kneading the dough uh in order

234
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,800
to really spread uh the uh the Water Into the the moisture into the all the

235
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,880
uh the flower particles become moist and some way there's kind of a kneading and a full folding and and maybe it is like

236
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:06,119
folding folding bread and eaing bread and uh and if you were are very

237
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:12,000
relaxed and enjoy making bread enjoy eating bread it can be delightful uh

238
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:20,280
activity to just be kneading it and folding and kneading and folding um or or I associate sometimes

239
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:27,000
with um when I have uh received a massage and um and sometimes in certain

240
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,880
massages I like to breathe in the rhythm of the massuse kneading my muscles and

241
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:41,240
this uh breathing with uh the slow kneading of the different muscles um just feels like such a nice way of

242
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:49,800
flowing and being really present and connected to what's happening and uh so it's not a fixing

243
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,200
attention it's not steering at something and some people when they think of uh

244
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:03,160
concentration they feel like they have to kind of have this laser focus that's unwavering and um and that can create a

245
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:11,599
lot of strain but rather it's a very soft uh I like to think of it as um uh

246
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,920
just short of doing nothing just enough and different times of day different

247
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:22,319
times of situations that just enough uh is different how much effort we have to

248
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:29,079
make but uh but we're trying to make a very light effort so that some of the

249
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:36,520
the natural way in which awareness kind of roams and explores and moves around

250
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:42,040
an object happens just like with the eyes a relaxed eyes will roam around an

251
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:50,400
object to see it in different ways with very relaxed um uh movements not no not

252
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:57,640
staring at something if we want something from the object that we were looking at um then we stare and then

253
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:05,280
there could be a strain but if we just kind of want to know it in a relaxed way so the same thing with

254
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:12,040
um with uh feeling and senting um and it's uh some people it's

255
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:17,119
much more physical it's a fencing and feeling sometimes it's more of a

256
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,720
observing sometimes it's more of a knowing that goes on but it's really

257
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:29,680
right there with the breathing and what's nice about the rhythm of breathing people who for whom this works

258
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,480
is that the the rhythm of the breathing is little bit akin to the rhythm of um

259
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:43,119
connecting and sustaining attention connecting and sustaining attention stay right here stay right here and if that

260
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:50,040
can be done so it's almost like the the the the concentration that builds it

261
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:57,599
doesn't build from in sustaining but it builds in action in the activity of

262
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,599
connecting and sustaining connecting sustaining and the Art of this is to

263
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,960
know how to do that so that um it just feels like a natur for you the natural

264
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:18,760
Rhythm or easeful or or absorbing to do it and as I said sometimes if uh you can

265
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:26,520
almost use the inhale and exhale as the speed and rhythm of that massage so to

266
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:33,240
connect with the beginning of the inhale sustain it to the end connect to the beginning of exhale

267
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:40,079
sustain it to the end and um and uh and these two little activities connecting

268
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,920
sustaining give us just enough to do that it might be easier to stay focused

269
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,440
there um on the breathing in a relaxed absorbing way and there might be

270
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:58,040
thoughts but they kind of go to the periphery we don't have to be focused on them

271
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:05,640
and there at this point this stage in the meditation yes there will be thoughts that begin taking you away

272
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:12,200
that's normal that's completely at this stage the approach stage but uh but they don't take you very

273
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,400
far and now you can kind of watch and see the Mind beginning to go and because

274
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:24,960
you're in this rhythm of connecting and sustaining you see it the thinking beginning to go away and then you kind

275
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,280
of fold it back in fold thinking back into the activity of staying with a

276
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:38,319
breath rhythm with a breath some of you might find that it works better if you always can maintain

277
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:44,680
that very quiet counting uh very still soft count

278
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:51,480
because it gives a thinking mind something to do that keeps you focused rather than uh you know have thinking

279
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:57,960
mind Idol so it wanders off for some people uh uh rather than

280
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:04,720
counting there might be a single word like in out or even the word yes works

281
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:11,119
very well and uh I found the word yes to work really well when I'm also at the

282
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:16,280
same time become starting to become aware of the good influence that the

283
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,720
meditation has on the rest of me the pleasure that we talked about last week

284
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,760
and we start and the the pleasure becomes like the supporting actors or

285
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:34,119
the pleasure becomes the cheerleaders or the pleasure becomes the the encouragement you're doing well this is

286
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:42,400
good and um and uh and then you're um uh you know

287
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,920
it's almost like it's the pleasure is is teaching you oh this is a nice way of

288
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,599
doing it so for example M needing the bread uh if you're in a hurry and you

289
00:41:54,599 --> 00:42:01,359
you know you can't really have to finish it quickly and and maybe there's people around you wanting your attention and

290
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:08,079
they're upset with you because you're not paying enough attention to them then you start needing it really fast and in

291
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:14,160
a stressful way and it doesn't feel good but if no one's there and you love doing

292
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:20,000
the bread you like the quiet and peace of the kitchen the lighting is coming in from the window just right and

293
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,359
everything is clean around you in the kitchen and and you don't have any any

294
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:31,880
press pressing responsibilities the moment and it just feels such a wonderful Delight to feel the texture

295
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,599
and the moisture and the and the movements of kneading the bread and

296
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,559
something inside of you kind of begins to relax and soften that says oh this is good almost like you don't want to stop

297
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:50,599
doing it uh even though you you're needing it Way Beyond what's really necessary it's just like such a nice

298
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:57,720
thing to do so uh whether you could follow all that in your own practice

299
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:04,760
um that is um um you know the IDE is all this is

300
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:10,280
supposed to if nothing else uh not be what you should do but it could be maybe

301
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:19,079
a a reference point to understand what you do do what works for you and what doesn't work for you so uh uh maybe some

302
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:25,160
of you will know clearly that um yeah counting doesn't work other people will

303
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,640
yes it works some people will say oh this thing about um this connecting and

304
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:36,520
sustaining I don't quite understand it I already have a good way of being with the breathing so I think I'll stay with

305
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:42,520
it for now so you're kind of finding your own way but I'm offering you all these

306
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:51,839
different elements and hopefully some of them will work for you support you in the process of becoming uh really

307
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:57,160
absorbed in the meditation practice absorbed in

308
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:02,720
such a way that the Mind thinking mind becomes quieter and Stiller and softer

309
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:12,440
and there's a feeling of well-being connected to meditation so may your connecting and
