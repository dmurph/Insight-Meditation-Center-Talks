1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,940
so welcome good morning uh good afternoon even evening I believe

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,000
um

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,240
it's nice to see all the names and uh lovely yeah

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,019
um you know I talk a big game about uh

5
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:35,280
letting go and uh that's honest I try to represent my life

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:43,440
and practice with a lot of honesty but the uh Golden State Warriors played

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,480
last night for those who don't know it's a local

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:56,640
basketball team sports ball some people call it and um

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:04,519
they're at the end of kind of dynastic run and uh

10
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,299
it was a tight game and I was

11
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:19,799
as the kids say a hot mess and I had this moment

12
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:26,280
as I was being told to calm down had this moment of thinking like I am

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,320
not a person who anyone should ever listen to or look

14
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,640
to for wisdom

15
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,600
um that I thought of you and um

16
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,380
Wild but here we are

17
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:56,640
ah something about caring for things that

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,960
actually don't really matter that I like

19
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:13,039
um they won they won by the way Steph

20
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,920
yeah um okay that's the intro for our meditation

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,420
and uh let us uh let us contemplate

22
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,840
the depths of human potential okay

23
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,080
so finding a posture feels sustainable

24
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,239
foreign

25
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:08,180
just taking stock of your heart

26
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,100
the impacts and residues

27
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,680
of the day so far the week this year

28
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:48,198
whatever's here in this moment just awake to the residues of the moment

29
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,180
and we relax

30
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,880
willing to feel whatever residues are here

31
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:56,400
maybe we use the the breathing to smooth out the energy

32
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,780
of our body mind

33
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,340
to to unify the field of the body

34
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,620
cooling the hyperintensity is

35
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:35,520
enlivening the

36
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:40,039
unconscious or numbed out Zone

37
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:39,019
there is a kind of effort we make in practicing

38
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:47,339
that we want to be careful about

39
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,420
not letting our willfulness eclipse

40
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:02,060
the grace of this moment

41
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,019
the way is the

42
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:24,860
self-based efforting

43
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,120
obscures something important

44
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:46,459
and so you're invited to relax that too

45
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,760
the effort we make is partnered

46
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:24,000
the effort to relax these surges

47
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,579
of willfulness

48
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,760
to actually sense the abrasiveness

49
00:17:52,500 --> 00:18:01,100
of always doing something to the moment to ourselves

50
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:42,899
and then in a way there is nothing left to do but be awake

51
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:50,039
and it can be supportive to have of course an anchor for the

52
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:54,799
attention for the attentional spotlight

53
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,620
but uh

54
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:17,340
the attention often

55
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,580
as a kind of flavor of meanness

56
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:35,000
the awareness that emerges out of that attention

57
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,140
doesn't taste like me

58
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:15,080
whatever doesn't depend on you

59
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,419
rest there

60
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,919
foreign

61
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,980
foreign

62
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,520
okay

63
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,940
foreign

64
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:58,440
the uh contemplation of mortality can support

65
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,779
uh samadhi can cut through the noise and

66
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:09,240
clarify what of value to us

67
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:17,340
and um and today insight into self self limits

68
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:23,100
of willfulness the ways in which my

69
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:29,059
my life does not belong entirely to me

70
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,679
and mortality offers uh us the

71
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:42,360
contemplation maybe we can say the egos helplessness

72
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,580
the world that is unresponsive to our willfulness

73
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:54,658
Tuesday I think was futurelessness

74
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,779
samadhi today helplessness because

75
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:09,559
what of life is left when the ego is all out of moves

76
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:16,799
and death um

77
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:22,279
is in one sense a kind of the ultimate humbling

78
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:28,019
but also the source of a great deal of our

79
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:34,200
of our grandiosity and

80
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:42,659
this sense of of self sense of self as a kind of Hub of control so what I was

81
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:49,980
alluding to with the ways in which you know the direction of attention the

82
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:57,120
kind of attentional Spotlight can incarnate a congealed sense of self

83
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,820
a sense of like me as the attentional agent

84
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:08,040
foreign the attention to the breathing or the

85
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,919
body or this or that and then and then something else in the

86
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:19,579
field that does not depend on us that does not taste like me

87
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:26,398
the sense of self is the kind of Hub of control this is

88
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:32,520
um death obliterates control and throws us off

89
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:38,000
so one Gabriel Vasquez

90
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,240
adulthood um brings with it the pernicious illusion of control perhaps even depends

91
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:50,460
on it I mean the Mirage of dominion over our

92
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:56,820
life that allows us to feel like adults where we associate maturity with autonomy

93
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:04,859
Sovereign right to determine what's going to happen next disillusion comes sooner or later no one

94
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:10,260
who lives long enough can be surprised to find their biography has been molded

95
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,480
by distant events by other people's Wills with little or no participation

96
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,359
from our own decisions those along processes that end up

97
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:27,660
running into our life sometimes to give it the shove it needed sometimes

98
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:33,500
to blow to Smithereens or most Splendid plans tend to be hidden like

99
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:40,500
Subterranean currents like tiny shifts of tectonic plates

100
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,720
when the earthquake finally comes we invoke the words we've learned to calm

101
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:53,299
ourselves accident fluke sometimes fate

102
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:06,319
what is what is our relationship to helplessness

103
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:12,480
before we die we want to develop a relation

104
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,660
a relationship to helplessness that's Michelle McDonald's language

105
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:24,859
often would say like develop a relationship with

106
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,880
and sometimes I think a synonym for dukkah usually translated suffering a

107
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:40,740
synonym for ducas may be helplessness and there's almost always some move to

108
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:47,240
make but our capacity for for

109
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:52,160
influence creates the illusion of control

110
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,619
and then we come to a place where there's no move

111
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:05,520
to make and maybe we've not developed a kind of relationship with helplessness

112
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,240
and part of meditation practice is about willingly

113
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,240
experiencing helplessness

114
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,400
we call it surrender

115
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,359
maybe we call it equanimity

116
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:33,020
and part of why we do this is that willfulness

117
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:38,539
obscures certain qualities of the heart mind

118
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:50,780
the moment is never perfect when I'm in it

119
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:10,760
it can feel um can feel terrible not to be able to do something

120
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:18,000
um it's yeah it's like the Cardinal you know an animal it's like helplessness has got to be

121
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,859
the lowest on the list you know you can feel so terrible but then then

122
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:31,579
of course there's like so much relief sometimes

123
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:37,980
sometimes when we actually just give up on exerting ourself

124
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:44,420
like on making change unchanging something someone

125
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:50,520
and so I part of this contemplation of

126
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:58,260
mortality is is to help us find a way to keep our heart open even amidst

127
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:04,200
powerlessness where

128
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:11,780
we're surrendering our clinging or doing nothing left to engineer

129
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:21,240
um Tibetan teacher can say ripache said something like I don't remember it exactly but something like at the end of

130
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:26,838
our life our mind gets very small or very vast

131
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,800
and I for sure have seen both

132
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:40,500
and sometimes when people are at the end of their life and they have nothing

133
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:47,040
in a sense nothing left to defend no territory to defend nothing really left

134
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,800
to fear the love gets a very vast

135
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,339
right it's like the hatred and the contraction

136
00:39:58,339 --> 00:40:03,560
the tightness is a is a function of the

137
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,180
territoriality the fear

138
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:18,119
said that um you know we

139
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:24,119
we usually think about the self as the cause of things but the Buddha said that

140
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:30,420
it's it's the effect the self is the effect of things the

141
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:38,040
effect of what to my mind most centrally I'd say it's

142
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,320
the effect of fear

143
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:51,240
and part of how we we kind of Ensure our safety

144
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:59,220
is by by uh in a sense we orchestrate our Survival by by

145
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:06,300
hallucinating self the self in a certain sense feels like

146
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:12,780
the kind of headquarters of my clinging you know

147
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:18,140
longing for more fear of an end

148
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:24,119
and so in our practice we we can notice like the more

149
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:29,160
safe it feels in meditation

150
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,800
the more deeply the moment feels like Refuge

151
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,579
the more we can forget ourselves

152
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:48,060
the more safe we feel the more we forget ourselves

153
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:53,700
and then some stimulus frightens us

154
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:59,400
right we hear something we think something with the knee hurts

155
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:05,900
and we like are chased back into the corner of self

156
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:19,020
so maybe we say self is is it it may be partially it's the the effect of fear

157
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:27,680
but it's also part of what makes death seem so terrifying

158
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:35,280
because um you can feel like we imagine death from the perspective of self or

159
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:42,000
imagining the destruction of the self

160
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,960
and

161
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:54,859
where where in a certain way protecting a phantom

162
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:03,540
you know I I don't think insight into I'm not not self is like a perfect

163
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:09,660
consolation for death and loss it's not a perfect

164
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:17,480
consolation and it's imperfection that's the theme for tomorrow not perfect

165
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:22,400
but it's very meaningful it's pretty good

166
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:31,859
the philosopher the very famous quote Derek parfaith

167
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:38,880
it's difficult to believe that there is no such thing as an All or

168
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,119
Nothing self no deep further fact

169
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:52,500
beyond the multitude of small psychological facts that make you who you are but I believe that my existence was such

170
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:58,859
a further fact I seemed imprisoned in myself my life seemed like a glass tunnel

171
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:04,740
through which I was moving faster every year and at the end of which there was

172
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:10,079
Darkness when I change my view

173
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:16,440
the walls of my glass tunnel disappeared I now live

174
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,660
in the open air there is still difference between my

175
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:27,119
life and the lives of other people but the difference is less

176
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:33,839
other people are closer I'm less concerned about the rest of my

177
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:40,338
life and more concerned about the lives of others

178
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:58,160
death and self willfulness surrender

179
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:12,300
for this for your consideration so uh yeah may we live well today yeah

180
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:18,318
maybe maybe we live well whatever that means

181
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:26,400
um yeah touching to uh be with you and uh be uh swimming in

182
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,099
