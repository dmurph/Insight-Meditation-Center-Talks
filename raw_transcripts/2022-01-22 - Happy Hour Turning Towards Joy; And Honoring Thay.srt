your own happiness you have just one chance of being happy if you're happy for other people's happiness your

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,799

every time i hear the statistics of the number of people in this beautiful earth so so

14
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,159

or others gladden our gladness and gladness of others and letting our heart rest rest in joy

16
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:47,280
to be nourished to be nourished in gladness in its own good fortune and our own good fortune

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,640
that we often take for granted we often the mind turns to challenges and

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,960
difficulties and what's hard instead of realizing that there's so

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,920
many things that are going okay so many things that are going okay

20
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:13,280
so so with that what i'd like to invite us

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,840
um tonight in this practice is as we engage with other people's happiness

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,920
to to engage with gladness for them and of course the near

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,720
enemy which is envy could arise and that's okay you're not a bad meditator you're not a bad

24
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:40,480
person if any of that arises we'll work with that and also when we turn to our own

25
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,959
gladness to our own happiness it can be expressed as

26
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,480
um gratitude when we're happy for our own

27
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,120
happiness happy for our own happiness it becomes gratitude it feels like

28
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,360
gratitude so so [Music]

29
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,800
these are some um invitations and of course we'll fill it

30
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,040
uh fill in all the details uh practically not just talking about a

31
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,120
blah blah blah there's only so much that talking can do with these topics but actually

32
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,400
feeling into them and experiencing them firsthand for ourselves so

33
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,040
so with that yeah i think that's all i want to say to set the the frame we're just going to

34
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,480
turn towards joy tonight yay happy hour turning to joy why not let's turn to joy

35
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,360
oh i guess there's only one last thing i want to say um yeah um to frame the topic and that

36
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:59,280
is if if if what's coming up in your heart and your mind is like oh i've had a hard day i'm not in the mood for joy i

37
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,120
am just having a really hard time it's okay it's okay

38
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,360
joy is not forced joy is nurtured when we gently gently

39
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,400
turn the mind to what is good even if you're having a

40
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,960
hard day a difficult time in your body and your your mind

41
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,080
turning just inviting gently like like a little kitty that's under the bed kitty

42
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,400
kitty kitty kitty just inviting it shy kitty turning to what is good is there

43
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,840
something that's going okay well i have a roof over my head yay [Music]

44
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:48,160
yay hmm i had i had a nourishing meal yay so just gently gently don't have to

45
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,600
go whole hog all the way to yay joy if that doesn't feel appropriate

46
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:01,440
and yet and yet in praise of joy in praise of joy

47
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,039
the more joy you can contain

48
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,039
the more space there is for suffering to be with suffering with resilience for

49
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,520
yourself and for others so turning to joy is not

50
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:29,360
the selfish thing of oh i'm turning away from suffering oh i'm just going to like la de da la da pauliana

51
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,960
that's not the idea that's not the idea the more joy we can contain the more

52
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,240
resilience the more resilience there can be in our hearts our bodies

53
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,840
our minds to be with adversity without

54
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:55,199
falling into it without drowning in it for it to be balanced with goodness

55
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,680
for service for the benefit of ourselves and others so it's

56
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,560
it's for ourselves others and the world all right i think i'm now done with the

57
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,680
frame i wanted to set okay let's begin the meditation before i add more frames
