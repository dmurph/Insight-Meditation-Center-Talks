1
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:09,160
good evening welcome welcome so as I was sitting uh kind of

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,920
bubbled up like oh yeah maybe this topic here I am I'm I'm going to do more

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,119
on fear and I've uh been doing quite a few things on

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:28,240
fear it turns out it's such a rich topic there's like so many elements to it and

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,840
so many ways to consider it work with it look at it all these kinds of things

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,239
but if you're sick of fear I promise this will be the last

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,719
one but maybe I I'll uh to justify it I'll say that um I'll be teaching a

8
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,079
class in July that's called the path of fearlessness it's like a six I don't

9
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,600
remember how many months six or seven month program and we'll be looking at fear and all the different ways it shows

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,840
up in our lives and different ways to work with it and so that's partly I've been you know

11
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:09,960
really poking around in this topic of fear turns out to be very I don't know I

12
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:18,680
feel uh touched by it like I'm learning about practice in in some ways and just

13
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,439
you know what it means to be a human turns out fear is pretty

14
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,640
common so maybe I'll just say that I'm going to lump together

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:38,240
quite a few different ideas about fear so there's this fear of like imminent danger something's going to happen you

16
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,240
know we have fear about that you know the saber-tooth tiger or the bus that's

17
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,280
uh while we're crossing the street and there's also this maybe like

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,520
this less pressing fear fear of public speaking fear

19
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:06,280
of going to a place where you you don't know anybody know something like this and

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,800
then there's also kind of like anxiety there's this way in which this anxiety

21
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:19,599
is maybe this more generalized discomfort of something that's happening in the future maybe it's not even can't

22
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,920
quite maybe even put our finger on it what it is fear and anxiety of course

23
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:32,200
they both are concerned about things in the future but there there's a way in which

24
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,800
we might consider them in the same so I'm lumping them together but to be sure

25
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,840
I could give another Dharma talk I'm like why they're all different so there's value in that as well but for

26
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:51,640
the purpose of this talk I'm going to lump them together and so part of you know

27
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,959
actually this can I make this be just a little bit louder I keep on trying to make this speak closer but I I'm afraid

28
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:04,879
that I'll lose my voice at the end if I'm okay maybe this is better yeah thank you

29
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,640
Martha you guys don't want to hear me with my running out of my voice at the

30
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,840
end so part of the theme I want to talk about is like why bother why bother

31
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,680
talking about fear looking at fear working with fear like what's this kind

32
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,840
of the theme and I'll say that uh last week

33
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,599
talked about like the way to fearlessness was the topic and it talked about how the path of practice that we

34
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:41,840
do that's to find Freedom is the same path of practice that can really help

35
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,159
with fear and the week before that I did Fe

36
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:55,760
a as a way to practice with fear friend it befriend it explore or examine it

37
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,360
allow it and release it I talked about that

38
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,840
but maybe in general we can say about just working with fear is similar to

39
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,000
working with other strong uncomfortable

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,440
experiences so whatever we learn about fear it's part of the value is can help

41
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:25,280
us with anger and sadness and just these other kind of sometimes uh uncomfortable

42
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,440
experiences that humans have but i' like to start with a

43
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,680
poem this a poem by Rosemary traumer she's this wonderful poet I think that

44
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,479
uh she's I don't know I just appreciate how she's able to put in words or

45
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:48,600
Express things with a little bit of Whimsy and a lot of

46
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:56,120
wisdom so here's Rosemary traumer with this poem hello

47
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,120
fear and it goes like this there I was making tea in my kitchen

48
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,360
when fear hit me like a school bus I didn't need a scientist or a

49
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,759
therapist to tell me it hurt I screamed ah I shouted no but after smashing into

50
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:22,479
me fear just opened the folding glass door of the bus yanked me on then popped

51
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:29,720
me into a green vinyl seat I'm scared I said yeah fear said CU

52
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,680
I'm scary yeah I salled as the bus greened through the couch through the bedroom

53
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,400
the splintering dining room table what if I lose everything I said

54
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,280
to fear yeah said fear what if you do and

55
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:55,800
who will I be when everything changes yeah said fear who will you

56
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,240
be then he opened the door and shoved me off the bus and I was standing again

57
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,880
beside the familiar green counter teacup in hand not a drop

58
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:15,759
spilled who will you be he shouted from the half openen window I took a deep breath not knowing

59
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,960
how to answer good fear said as if uncertainty

60
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,199
were a gift and who fear said as the bus peeled

61
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,919
away who are you now who are you

62
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:40,880
really I don't know I I'm smiling while I read this because it's just kind of this playfulness right of this bus

63
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,240
sometimes we have this expression you know just getting carried away or we have this exer I got hit by a bus is a

64
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,479
way that like just got overwhelmed and rosemary traumer she's kind of like works with

65
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:59,599
this and so I'd like to use this kind of this poem as a way to unpack and to talk

66
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:06,319
about some different ways of kind of what Rosemary trummer is pointing to in this poem at least in my interpretation

67
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,879
of her poem So It Begins right where she oh

68
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:20,599
maybe I'll just read these few lines again just the first view there I was making tea in my kitchen when fear hit

69
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:27,160
me like a school bus I didn't need a scientist or a therapist to tell me it hurt I screamed

70
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,319
ah I shouted no but after smashing into me fear just opened the folding glass

71
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:39,599
door of the bus yanked me on then popped me into a green vinyl

72
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,199
seat fear is never invited it just shows up and sometimes

73
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:54,120
it's just those times here or she's describing just being in the kitchen with a cup of tea in my mind I can

74
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,400
imagine maybe she's looking at the window in the kitchen and and just maybe

75
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,520
there's a moment of relaxation cup of teas a little bit soothing and it's often when we

76
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,879
relax that the things that we've been trying to Tamp down kind of like

77
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,199
arrive might be during meditation in fact it's not uncommon that during

78
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:26,038
meditation the same type of thing when there's a sense of settledness and ease and fear can show

79
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:32,880
up and I kind of like this idea of a school bus this poet she chose a school

80
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,279
bus maybe because it's something like when we are have a lot of fear there might be a way in which we kind of feel

81
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,680
like the younger version of ourselves we don't necessarily feel like the adults

82
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,880
that's trying to convince yeah I got everything under control I don't have any fear I'm not afraid of anything or

83
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,600
whatever it might be just way of kind of the school bus is not only there's a

84
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,920
younger version of oursel maybe maybe but also the fact that it's a

85
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,720
bus in my interpretation is highlighting there's a lot of people on

86
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,959
this bus fear turns out to be so common even though we don't often talk about it or

87
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:21,480
even even notice it we're giving it different language or we're calling it something

88
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,720
else but there's a way that kind of maybe recognizing that it's showing up on a

89
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,120
bus is way that we can connect with other people recognize the common

90
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:40,880
Humanity of feeling fear humans are vulnerable of course we

91
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,079
are so of course we have fear because there is danger it doesn't mean that all the

92
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:53,839
things that we consider dangerous are in fact dangerous in the way that we imagine them but we're not invincible so

93
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,920
of course there is fear and part of this practice is to help understand those fears that are

94
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:08,079
helpful and those fears that are not helpful and so something else this in

95
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:15,079
the beginning of this poem she uh she has this uh this line I screamed ah I

96
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:21,440
shouted no this is how it is right when fear

97
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,519
arrives there's this resistance no I don't want this go away there this of

98
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:34,440
course there is this generalized feeling of this is not what I

99
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,120
wanted and it's fascinating that we can for me it's

100
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:48,399
fascinating that we can work with this sense of no right there's this uh we have fear

101
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:55,279
that just arises Uninvited and then there's this sense of no I don't want it and there's a way

102
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,600
that this fear and the resistance to the fear are pushing and supporting each

103
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,560
other there's a way that they're kind of like in this little Loop and sometimes to be with the fear

104
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:15,480
is overwhelming or you know there might be trauma associated with it maybe it's not even wise to go right into the

105
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,160
fear but this resistance all the ways in which we say

106
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,959
no could be enormously helpful to pay attention to

107
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:36,279
this it's so there's this way that um resistance can show up as this tightness

108
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:43,959
in the body or this blaming others or blaming ourselves and just to be with

109
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:49,760
that let the fear take care of itself but to be with the

110
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:57,399
resistance because we have not only resistance to fear but I was mentioning earlier so many difficult uncomfortable

111
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:03,320
situations and so we can just being with the resistance is a way that we can like

112
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,720
help the fear to diminish kind of like allow it to do

113
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:16,920
this arise and pass away because of course the fear is going to end it's not there

114
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,959
always but something that often that we don't talk about is that fear can be a

115
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:28,079
support for practice I've been talking about okay here's how to get rid of it here's how

116
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,320
to work with it or something like this but there's a way in which fear has a

117
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,079
role in our life and in our practice and I like this uh expression

118
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:46,240
that Jack cornfield has he says that fear is the

119
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,839
membrane between the familiar and the

120
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:00,560
unfamiliar between the familiar and the unfamiliar so recognizing so often the fear is of the unknown or the fear is

121
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:07,279
about you know what's about to happen it's part of why it's uh unfamiliar but

122
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:16,320
this idea if you're feeling fear you're out of your comfort zone but this is also how we grow this

123
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:23,920
is also how we like expand our capacity is to get on the kind of like

124
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,040
maybe push this membrane between the familiar and the unfamiliar

125
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,079
how much does the fear of the unknown kind of like limit us limit Our Lives

126
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:40,800
limit the ways that we think about what's possible for ourselves or

127
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:48,560
possible for others or possible for the world or some skills that we think that

128
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,519
oh I'm not I don't want to undertake that but I don't know how yet or something like

129
00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:00,519
this this unknown I don't quite know how that's going to

130
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:07,199
unfold and also I'll say that the I'm going to have a little drink of water

131
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,320
here also we might recognize that the hero's journey includes

132
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,680
fear right and this journey is where the the protagonist embarks on this

133
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:35,199
adventure like uh faces and overcomes challenges and then under goes personal

134
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:41,920
growth and transformation and then comes back with gift bestowing hands now that

135
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,199
they've learned something that they can not only live their life different but they can help others in a way that they

136
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:54,680
couldn't before but this way of meeting obstacles and over and working with them

137
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,959
and being able to meet those challenges always involves

138
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:05,759
fear but this hero's journey right this is part of how we grow I'm doing I'm

139
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:13,279
making a circle with my hun because there's a way in which we come back to where we started but we've changed so

140
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:20,199
maybe the external environment hasn't changed but we've changed and I think all of us have this

141
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:25,399
experience having some difficulties that we wouldn't wish on

142
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:31,920
anybody but then recognizing on the other side of that oh yeah I did learn something

143
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,920
really powerful and meaningful and maybe even transformative so this recognizing that

144
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:45,639
fear even though it's Uninvited and uncomfortable it can be a support for

145
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:51,759
our life and for our practice so then I I'll come back to

146
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:58,399
this poem the uh the person in the poem says

147
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:06,959
I'm I'm scared I said yeah fear said cuz I'm scary yeah I salled as the bus cined

148
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,639
through the couch through my bedroom through the splintering dining room

149
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,720
table so this bus is going through these different parts of the

150
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,279
house started in the kitchen and then we see was it like the couch the bedroom

151
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,800
and the dining room these are all the different areas of our life right the

152
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:36,959
ways that we show up in the kitchen the ways that we show up on the couch the way that we show up in the bedroom and the dining room table our relationships

153
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:43,680
our what we do for leisure what we um how we are with taking care of ourselves

154
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:50,319
you know there's way in which fear can touch so many of these different areas of our

155
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:56,319
lives and so in the same way working with

156
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:03,880
fear can take us to to many areas of Our Lives also for example this idea of just

157
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:13,240
exploring fear or examining Fear Can reveal a tremendous amount it can reveal

158
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,959
parts of our inner lives like because what we fear is related to what's

159
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:27,558
precious to us what is important to us so as we're like examining fear we

160
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:33,559
might discover something of these stories that we've created about who we think ourselves to be as we see here in

161
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:39,600
this poem we might have this idea of like well I'm afraid they won't like

162
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,919
me then we realize oh yeah and we have this might this underlying belief or

163
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:53,160
that everybody should like me like us and to be sure that's not a bad thing to

164
00:17:53,160 --> 00:18:00,919
have people like you but there's sometimes ways in which we are compromising or things that are

165
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:09,039
important to us or not standing up for what we know that is right or something like that just so that people will like

166
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:16,039
us so to recognize part of what our fear to explore it reveals our inner lives

167
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:21,799
maybe even what we think the purpose of our life is or what we value what's

168
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:26,960
important what feels threatened but when we examine the fear

169
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,760
we also reveal the way that kind of like these persistent fears that we have are

170
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:39,080
often like limiting our lives or limiting our freedom and we might not be aware that

171
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,960
the role that fear has in our lives until we really look at it and examine

172
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,280
it fear might show up kind of maybe just in general as apprehension or hesitation

173
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,960
or dread or worry but also maybe more explicitly as not being able to sleep

174
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:04,000
well or just feeling moody in a bad mood or

175
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,559
in a dampened mood or heavy mood or just being really light moods all over the

176
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,640
place or can also just show up as the opposite of kind like not expressing our

177
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:22,039
emotions we don't want anybody to see the fear perhaps or something so there's a way in which we're kind like tightened

178
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:28,000
up and clammed up and not sharing so it really has a big role on our emotions

179
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,880
whether we're ones we're expressing or even not

180
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:41,640
expressing and there is a way in which we could say that fear you know is such a big part of conflict this way in that

181
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:49,039
we our inner life or what's uh limits our freedom this sense

182
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:55,960
of It kind of like it can sorry that lost my thinking

183
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,400
there that it's at the root of conflict in the sense that we're afraid that

184
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:12,799
somebody is going to take credit for something that we did at work for example or that they won't um respect us

185
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,799
if we share what's really going on with us or they

186
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:25,640
will um not appreciate the our vulnerability because it makes them feel

187
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,159
vulnerable so they'll be turned away turns out though that right being

188
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:39,440
vulnerable in a way that feels comfortable like not sharing too much but not being closed off it's really how

189
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,880
people connect it's really how people form relationships and

190
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,799
friendships and it's if with the it there's been lots of studies about this

191
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:59,240
that uh if somebody seems like a little bit vulnerable then maybe I shouldn't

192
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,400
even just the opposite maybe a little bit vulnerable or that is not completely

193
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,760
perfect or polished then people are more apt to you

194
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,480
know want to talk to them or have a or include them in what's happening or

195
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,840
you know have them as part of the

196
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,159
conversation and so exploring fear also reveals some of our patterns of reaction

197
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:35,960
ativity the way that this resistance that I spoke about shows up it can be this procrastination

198
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:43,120
avoidance anger blaming lashing out so the way that we kind of resist fear so

199
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:51,000
much is also we could be resisting anger or sadness or anything else that's

200
00:21:52,880 --> 00:22:00,440
uncomfortable and then also looking at fear reveals the role all that desire

201
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:07,840
and expectations and clinging have in our lives because fear is so often

202
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,640
related to this it's like we're afraid of losing things so we're really holding

203
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,799
on or there's this like this vicious circle of fear leads to

204
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:25,120
clinging and then this which and then the clinging kind of leads to this

205
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,320
identification then identification leads back to to fear because the things that

206
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:39,000
we're clinging to feel like um they're often feel under threat whatever often we're clinging to

207
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,520
ideas about ourselves and we want others to see us a particular

208
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,760
way we're expectations we want to feel a certain

209
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,960
way and we're maybe afraid of we don't want to be uncomfortable so I expect that this will happen and this won't

210
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,240
happen it'll be the right temperature and and it won't be too loud or too

211
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:09,080
quiet or these types of things but so not only does kind of

212
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,919
looking at fear help us to learn about ourself but it helps us to hone some of

213
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:21,400
our some skills like how to be with difficulty but

214
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:29,799
also how this recognition that some fear is appropriate and some is not

215
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:37,679
you know fear sometimes um I had this habit when I was younger maybe it was

216
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:44,919
like from when I was really young just a grade school age and sometimes I find it

217
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:51,520
showing up uh when I'm I don't know what the conditions are but sometimes it shows up that I used to have this idea

218
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:58,080
that when I was walking on the sidewalk I shouldn't step on the crack because we had the saying when I

219
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,440
was a kid like step on the crack break a back or something like this and

220
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,600
sometimes even as an adult I'm like oh wait I you know I'm adjusting my feet so that I don't step on the crack this is

221
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,600
silly right this is but there's a way in which things that really don't make

222
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:24,559
sense show up and for us to really pay attention like oh yeah fear of harming

223
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,880
others this could be helpful fear of St stepping on the crack and the sidewalk

224
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,960
not so helpful so helps us to kind of like make some distinctions what are our

225
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:42,159
reactions are they appropriate or maybe they're not so

226
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:49,080
appropriate and just to have that activity this question of like is this helpful is this not helpful is this

227
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:57,120
healthy or is this not healthy learning to do this with fear we can also do this with our anger with our

228
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:05,520
sadness or are blaming or this inner critic like there's so many different ways in which we can do

229
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:14,720
this and then I also want to say that looking at fear can help us to face death face

230
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,080
death with more equinity there's this way

231
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:27,120
that part of you know we have this fear of deaths we never look at it I shouldn't say never we are tend to not

232
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:33,080
look at it or um even think about

233
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:40,679
it but there's a way in that if we can reflect on death it's even a practice

234
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:47,600
some of you may know this marati these death contemplation just this recognition I'm going to die you're

235
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,120
going to die everybody's going to die if the fear kind of gets moved away

236
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:01,440
or even isn't there I'm sure it's probably there but there's a way in which we can work look at death in a way

237
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,960
that can be sacred and we can work with death in a way that can be

238
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,880
liberating and I had a good friend who was a practitioner and as he was

239
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:21,360
dying he just kind of I felt like he showed all of us like how to die with um

240
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,440
I don't know with some beauty and Grace it was such a gift that he gave us that

241
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,720
he he had can and he was for many many years he knew that he was dying so he

242
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,919
had time to get his Affairs in order and to say goodbye and but just

243
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:42,600
to I don't know it was a beautiful just kind of like a letting go and the

244
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:49,360
unknown and he had some fear I'm sure he did but just a way that uh he didn't

245
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:58,000
hide it it was a it was a beautiful thing to re to recognize oh yeah people to there

246
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,039
the dying process can be a beautiful process it's going to happen anyways for

247
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:11,360
all of us and then the last part of this

248
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:19,440
poem what if I lose everything I said to fear yeah said fear what if you do and

249
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:26,159
who will I be when everything changes yeah said fear who will you be

250
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,279
then he opened the door and shoved me off the bus and I was standing again

251
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:38,440
beside the familiar green counter teacup in hand not a drop

252
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:45,240
spilled who will you be he shouted from the half openen window I took a deep

253
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:54,480
breath not knowing how to answer good fear said as if uncertainty

254
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,360
were a gift and who fear said as the bus peeled

255
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,440
away Who Are You Now who are you

256
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,679
really so much about fear is this fear of the

257
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:18,000
unknown the truth is we don't know as much as we think we

258
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,320
do fear the unknown is often like well I'm not quite sure how that's going

259
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:29,120
to happen how that's going to unfold but how many things in your life

260
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,480
have turned out just the way you thought they were this is coming from somebody who

261
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,960
has a PHD in Biochemistry and is now sitting here as a Dharma teacher right how many times in

262
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,080
our lives we think like oh things are going to go this way and then they kind of like turn out going another way

263
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,880
that's like in the big picture but often you know we have these fears about

264
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,960
what's going to happen if we go to this uh holiday

265
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,840
gathering that we get invited to for example and I don't really know anybody I only know that one person and oh it's

266
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,640
going to be awful I'm just going to be standing there nobody's going to talk to me and maybe maybe

267
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,200
not there's this way in which we have this uh this we just want to have some

268
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,799
confidence in things that we don't really know but it turns out that

269
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:31,760
uncertainty is kind of the way forward because fear like in order to not feel

270
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:37,919
fear we're trying to like control things and which is limiting we're like

271
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:44,320
limiting what's possible for ourselves and what's possible for

272
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:50,679
others having uncertainty the sense of H I don't

273
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:55,960
know it's so much better like oh my gosh okay I have to make sure this doesn't happen I have to make sure that doesn't

274
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:03,080
happen therefore I'm going to do this I'm going to take care of that and but there's a way I'm just saying I'm not

275
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,600
sure that might be awful it might not be awful

276
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,880
too but to somehow allow things to unfold in a way instead of always trying

277
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,080
to shev them a particular way and make them be a certain

278
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:26,279
way so I'm not saying to be completely passive and I am not encouraging like

279
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:33,799
just terrible horrible things to just keep going but I am encouraging us to

280
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:39,960
not uh assume that we have to um Corral everything

281
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:45,720
or um try to make sure it only goes the way

282
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:54,039
that we think it should go so often things have a like a natural

283
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:59,240
unfolding that might be better than what we're even thinking

284
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,919
about and sometimes there is a part of us that prefers the difficulties and

285
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,360
that prefers the stress and prefers the

286
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:21,120
you know this worry because it's familiar so we shouldn't underestimate

287
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,720
like how much we are often trying to get rid of uncertainty and in order to do

288
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:34,840
that we're holding on to things that just aren't helpful for us and we have these patterns you know

289
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:41,159
of familiarity these are really powerful and so there can be some wisdom but we

290
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:46,639
can also bring some questioning like when we see when we recognize some of

291
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:52,159
our patterns of behavior yeah I'm usually showing up this

292
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:58,120
way well is part of that is just because it's familiar

293
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:05,480
what would it be like to invite more uncertainty in our lives you just this little bit of fear like you know I'm not

294
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:11,399
quite sure how this is going to go and can that be

295
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:17,720
okay because as I said we really don't know as much as we think we do and we

296
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,919
certainly don't control as much as we think we do even though we try right of

297
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:30,559
course we do so the truth is that

298
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:38,799
uncertainty is is can be like this Doorway to freedom and this fear this membrane

299
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:45,000
between what's familiar and what's not familiar this it can be a door that's

300
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,240
closed but fear can be a doorway but it's often in uncertainty is

301
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,960
the next step but then that can lead to Greater Freedom greater

302
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:05,039
ease something that maybe we haven't even imagined yet maybe we don't even

303
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:11,320
know can't even we don't even have an idea what it might

304
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:18,840
be so in this way working with fear can work with also this sense of uh our

305
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:25,440
sense of self that so often we feel like has to be protected and bolstered and

306
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,000
made to look good but if we recognize this

307
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,679
uncertainty and say I don't know kind of like softens that this

308
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:44,399
sense of self is when we have this sense of certainty there's a sense of like I

309
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:51,240
know and when there's a sense of I don't know then there the there's a

310
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:59,600
opening there can be a less rigidity less limit so in this way working with fear

311
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:06,440
can be a support for greater Freedom so the next time that you're

312
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,079
having tea in the kitchen and fear

313
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,440
arises maybe maybe it'll be a school bus maybe it won't be a school bus but is

314
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:24,200
there a way that you can just a allow yourself to see what it has to show

315
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,440
you allow yourself to feel the experience of

316
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,200
fear maybe I'll say briefly to one way to be with fear and

317
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,200
that's not overwhelming is to be aware of the body what's happening in the body

318
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:48,240
the mind is gr really fast and making lots of stories especially when there's fear but if you can ground down into

319
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,358
feeling your feet on the ground feeling the lump of throat lump in your throat

320
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:59,720
or the butterflies in the belly or what whatever it might be that's a great way

321
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,839
to kind of like hold the fear without this sense of like it has

322
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:12,359
to go away and then maybe you can work with the resistance as I said before this sense of no and the sense of no

323
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:18,760
often is showing up in the jaw clenching the jaw or tightness in the jaw or

324
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:25,800
sometimes in the shoulders all of us are different but these are some generalizations of how to work with

325
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:32,400
this okay so with that I'll end and open it

326
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,520
up for some questions or comments thank

327
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,280
you I'm going to read this poem just one

328
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,119
more time yeah you know there's a way in which may be something that we you know

329
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,520
we hear more than once it uh because you guys might have your own interpretation of this right you might have something

330
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:20,319
else that sticks out for you there I was making tea in my kitchen

331
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:25,680
when fear hit me like a school bus I didn't need a scientist or therapist to

332
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:33,119
tell me it hurt hurt I screamed ah I shouted no but after smashing into me

333
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:39,280
fear just opened the folding glass door of the bus yanked me on then plopped me

334
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:46,880
into a green vinyl seat I'm scared I said yeah a fear said

335
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,319
cuz I'm scary yeah I squealed as the bus kened

336
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:57,800
through the couch through my bedroom through the splintering dining room table

337
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:04,480
what if I lose everything I said to fear yeah said fear what if you do and who

338
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:11,240
will I be when everything changes yeah said fear who will you be

339
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:19,079
then he opened the door and shoved me off the bus and I was standing again beside the familiar green counter teacup

340
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:25,640
in hand not a drop spilled who will you be he shouted from

341
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:33,160
the half openen window I took a deep breath not knowing how to answer good

342
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:40,520
fear said as if uncertainty were a gift and who fear said as the bus peeled

343
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:47,119
away Who Are You Now who are you

344
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:03,920
really hello so I'm having some fear right

345
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,200
now um first of all I wanted to just say like how much I appreciate that

346
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:16,800
reading I get so much more out of a poem when I hear it spoken I think and then the voice of fear seems

347
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:24,079
to sort of change or at least it seems in the end becomes instructive or an aid at

348
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:31,240
least that's one way you could look at it is sort of under reming the Identity or

349
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:36,599
exactly and then on a more personal note I've sort of realizing that there's also

350
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:44,359
fear of fear yes and I I just recent like in my within the

351
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:52,520
last year of my life I've realized just like how powerful fear has been in my life like from a very early age and I

352
00:38:52,520 --> 00:39:00,240
think I was always sort of trying to like to deny that was more of a social fear Than Physical fear in terms of

353
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:07,000
risk-taking or things like that and I don't really know where to go with that except it was just I think

354
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,680
maybe I'll sign up for for the class so path the

355
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:22,119
fearlessness yeah we're starting at end of January it seems like a very rich uh vein to a mind to look at

356
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:27,839
yes thank you I appreciate very much that you're saying that that fear has some wisdom at the end kind of like

357
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:34,200
undermining identity and then you said fear a fear yes I agree right even here

358
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:41,119
uh the poem says she goes I don't forget what she says oh I'm scared and yeah

359
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,440
fear said cuz I'm scary this fear of fear right how much a big role it has in

360
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,800
our lives I think if in my case it was like trying to deny that I was afraid

361
00:39:51,800 --> 00:40:00,640
and that's like this big thing you don't want to look at and leads to all sorts of undesirable outcomes so yeah

362
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:18,440
yeah um I uh appreciated what you said about I I think it was something like

363
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:24,800
Comfort Comfort or familiarity of of fear and and anxiety I think when I'm

364
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:31,560
feeling anxious about something um every topic that I'm anxious about

365
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:37,760
puts my mind into a certain a certain course and uh you know I have the same

366
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,599
kind of plans or whatever as I did last time to to deal with whatever I'm

367
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:49,839
anxious about and I guess there is a certain amount of comfort in that but it's also

368
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:55,760
frustrating that I'm doing I'm thinking the same thoughts again and of course I'm not getting any more out of them

369
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,920
this second time time or third time or 10th time as I did the first time

370
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,960
so uh it's almost like um you know I think that I'm this time I'm really

371
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,079
going to figure it out whatever

372
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:21,240
um yeah it does it does tend to put my mind in very familiar patterns

373
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:27,920
and there I guess there are there are aspects that that feel good and and

374
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,680
aspects of it that feel bad yeah yeah this makes perfect sense I think all of

375
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:40,119
us do this right we have our usual ways and they work a little bit or they work sometimes or you're like there's a

376
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:45,520
reason why we do it but then sometimes this recognition having to do something

377
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,720
different and maybe I'll just share for you and for others that I used to uh

378
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:57,480
when I noticed like fear was coming up or something I would just like do a long exhale this is just like the physiology

379
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:03,680
of long exhales just kind of help calm us down so I would just do that all the time like oh okay this works but the

380
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:10,000
fear would just like keep on coming back and it wasn't until I said you know what I'm going to stop doing this long exhale

381
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,560
and actually just kind of be with this fear and it turned out not to be so bad

382
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:24,079
what I was doing was like kind of soothing but the fear to be there like oh my goodness and then to kind of like

383
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,400
go away and then I don't know if felt like something shifted with that maybe

384
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:35,760
in the same way that you get into these thought grooves I was doing this and the thought grooves I mean they can be

385
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,760
helpful right and I was doing this physiological sigh or something like this to help it so maybe I'll just share

386
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:50,599
that too there's so many ways in which we get into these habits thank

387
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:01,760
you Diana I love the way you read the poem

388
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,680
thank you you're welcome it was it was great um for many years uh this is in

389
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,240
the somewhat distant past I noticed that as soon as I sat down to meditate what

390
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:18,359
would happen is what I called the three PS which was planning pleasing and

391
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:24,760
plating oh and of the I the placing and plating I could understand and the

392
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:30,400
planning was n just normal planning it was like planning the same thing again

393
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,000
and again which I recognized after a while was magical thinking like if I

394
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,480
planned this thing well enough then bad things wouldn't happen in my life and so

395
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:49,319
when I looked at those those three PS I thought oh okay that's fear yeah that um

396
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:55,599
and it was really helpful to recognize that thank you thank you for your talk

397
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:01,520
oh thank you thank you thank you Martha and thank you for saying this about fear is underneath planning absolutely

398
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,640
there's a way in this we're trying to control things or be prepared for whatever is going to happen because

399
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:14,680
we're afraid that somehow we'll be uncomfortable or something untour will happen yeah thank you Martha I like this

400
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:20,400
plating pleasing and planning okay the three

401
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:27,400
PS thank you all and I wish you all a good night and

402
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:33,160
safe travels way home and Thanksgiving is coming up so I hope that uh in

403
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:38,920
