1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:05,819
uh welcome everyone my name is May Elliott and this week we'll be focusing

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:12,059
on the five hindrances with each day focusing on one of the five and uh

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,460
during the Dharma talk I'll offer a practice uh that that works for all five

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:24,060
hindrances kind of a one-size-fits-all practice however each hindrance has its own

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:32,220
specific antidote and uh and during the guided meditations each day we'll explore the antidote for

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,520
each of the hindrances so today I'll be speaking about sense desire and one of the antidotes for

7
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,280
sense desire is observation of impermanence so the emphasis of the

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,539
meditation today will be noticing the passing away of experience and particularly if there's anything

9
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,699
Pleasant in one's experience watching the passing away of that

10
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,579
um as for the the structure of the meditation we'll stay with a primary

11
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:09,299
anchor and then if something becomes predominant will allow ourselves to connect with that new object then coming

12
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:17,240
back to the main anchor again so let's go ahead and get started

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:26,759
go ahead and find yourself in a stable upright posture

14
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:35,298
something that allows you to be alert and also relaxed at the same time

15
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,759
and connecting with a landing point for your meditation primary anchor

16
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,180
a place where your attention can rest that might be the breath I might be

17
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,280
focusing on sounds or it might be tuning into a global

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,040
sense of the body I'm just going to the bodily posture sitting and any of these

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,099
are fine as a as a primary anchor I'll provide instructions for working

20
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,220
with the breath but please stay connected to whatever anchor works for you

21
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:23,459
so coming into um a meditative space

22
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,760
all right taking a few deep breaths

23
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:46,099
and seeing if it's available to let go of anything extra

24
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,900
softening the muscles of the face the jaw

25
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,659
relaxing the shoulders

26
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,480
softening the belly

27
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,379
um and setting the intention to be here for

28
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,099
this time together

29
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,640
allowing your attention to make contact with the breath

30
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:08,519
the soundscape or the bodily posture and then sustaining that contact really

31
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:15,980
intending to be with it for the full length of the inhale the full length of the exhale

32
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,360
staying with whatever experience you're with

33
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,240
and if you notice that there's a lot of thinking this morning

34
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,740
you might just bow to the thoughts releasing them and then just slide right

35
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,979
back to the breath no need to be hard on ourselves for

36
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:45,000
thinking judge ourselves just the function of the mind to do this

37
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,020
in the same way that the mouth produces saliva uh the brain produces thoughts

38
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,840
this is just the function of that organ

39
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,720
so it's okay if there's thoughts now we just kindly direct the attention

40
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,539
back to the breath back to our primary anchor

41
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:21,840
so we'll take some time now to land together in silence sensing our experience

42
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,660
with a felt sense of the present moment

43
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,860
foreign

44
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:31,940
try bringing your attention to the end of the exhale

45
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,899
noticing the ending of the breath

46
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:50,899
noticing the way that the exhale slowly Fades out and dissipates

47
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,660
so we're allowing the mind to register the ending of things

48
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,980
foreign

49
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,459
knowing that the source of suffering is craving

50
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:08,760
clinging if we're able to see the endings of

51
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,160
things the passing away of all phenomena it's much less likely that we will

52
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:21,300
crave and cling to pleasant experience if we know that even that will pass away

53
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:28,680
so we're training the mind in seeing the endings of things so that the cheetah the heart mind can

54
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,980
be trained in letting go can be trained in seeing that all things pass

55
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,040
no need to Crave or cling anything

56
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:47,480
even if we get it we get what we want it too will pass

57
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,639
so to have insight into this quality of impermanence

58
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,820
allows us to hold things with an open hand

59
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,279
with a heart of non-clinging

60
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,720
developing Equanimity for the arising and passing of all experience

61
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,959
foreign

62
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:51,060
and as you breathe you might notice if there's any other Body Sensations that

63
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,740
are predominant in experience

64
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:10,639
maybe a sensation in the knee takes your attention

65
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,040
so then you allow the attention to feel the sensations in the knee

66
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:27,800
let me zoom in on those Sensations to really get a feel for them

67
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:42,680
you might notice the arising and passing of those Sensations

68
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,579
noticing if foreign

69
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:58,199
sensation in the knee is no longer predominant anymore seeing that passing

70
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:05,120
away and then returning to the breath

71
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,660
or if there is an itch noticing

72
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:21,900
the passing away of the sensation maybe the escalation of the sensation

73
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:27,959
changing from mild to intense and then the sustaining and the passing away of

74
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,660
that sensation so we're just taking some time now to

75
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:41,760
notice Body Sensations watching Body Sensations arise and pass

76
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,940
with a particular emphasis on the passing

77
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,659
foreign

78
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:06,299
foreign particularly if you're noticing any

79
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:10,580
Pleasant Sensations in the body

80
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:23,419
may be the sensation of ease maybe there's some relaxation or spaciousness

81
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,460
or there's some gladness in the heart

82
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:39,299
foreign you can allow yourself to attend to

83
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,139
those Sensations

84
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,059
allow yourself to be nourished by them to really take them in

85
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,559
and then be present for their passing away

86
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,580
and sometimes they might sustain for a long time or a short time without much

87
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:14,539
change just really being there for when there is a change

88
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:28,380
and if there's nothing Pleasant In This Moment maybe only a neutral experiences neither

89
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:37,220
Pleasant or unpleasant or maybe there's Pleasant or there maybe there's unpleasant Sensations

90
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:44,600
that's fine too you can attend to those and see see the passing away of them as well

91
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,080
foreign

92
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,100
of experience where you can attend to the passing away of things

93
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:59,580
where you can observe impermanence is at the ear door noticing the passing

94
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:05,539
away of sounds so you might try that now

95
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:14,880
sensing into the soundscape maybe there's bird calls or there's

96
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,020
traffic sounds

97
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:31,039
I'm taking a moment to rest in the soundscape sensing the passing away of the sounds

98
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,220
foreign as we do this practice we might notice that some

99
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:26,840
some Sensations some sounds they actually sustain for quite a long time

100
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:34,080
one area that we can notice the passing away of these things is just when the

101
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:40,740
attention shifts to a different object so there might be the sound of the refrigerator hum sustaining in the

102
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:47,039
background but when the the attention shifts from the soundscape to the breath

103
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:52,260
that refrigerator hum momentarily passes away when we shift the focus of our

104
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,559
attention

105
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,760
so that's another way that we can attend to the passing away of experience for

106
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,799
objects that seem to sustain

107
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:01,020
foreign as we near the end of our meditation

108
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:06,720
together see if you can notice the moment the

109
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,559
meditation the formal meditation comes to a close noticing the passing away of this

110
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:19,340
experience the way that it goes into the vanishing

111
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:34,080
and may our insight into impermanence our understanding of this change be a

112
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,960
catalyst for our own Awakening and The Awakening of others

113
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:47,700
may all beings be happy healthy safe and

114
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,840
completely free

115
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,980
foreign

116
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:44,460
welcome back I hope you enjoyed the meditation again my name is May Elliott

117
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:51,299
and I'm really happy to be here with you this week so for for the first several years of my

118
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:57,059
meditation practice my Central Central task of meditation was coming back to

119
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:02,220
the breath the mind would deviate from the breath and I would bring it back and then I

120
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:07,260
would do it again and I would bring it back and I'd bring it back and I'd bring it back and I'd bring it back this might

121
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:14,760
sound familiar to you and while this is skillful in many ways it really took a

122
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:22,440
long time for me before I realized it would actually be worthwhile to see why the mind was leaving to begin with like

123
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:29,220
what was happening that was causing the mind to deviate from the breath in the first place like what was hijacking the

124
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:34,500
mind and taking it for a ride so it wasn't until I started learning

125
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:41,700
about the five hindrances that I really started seeing what was fueling my discursive thinking and why it was

126
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:48,120
happening and then how to become free of it so I really see a study as the

127
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:54,360
hindrances of the hindrances as being essential for anyone training in

128
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:59,640
meditation which is exactly why I want to spend some time covering the basic

129
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:05,399
teachings on the hindrances this week so this is such a helpful training for for

130
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:11,220
anyone interested in the art of meditation and it completely applies to

131
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:18,240
daily life practices as well so this is really a Cornerstone for learning how to

132
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,960
be free in one's life and in one's practice so the five hindrances are start with a

133
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,480
sense desire the second is ill will often referred to as a version

134
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:40,399
um the third is sleepiness also known as sloth and torpor the fourth is restlessness and the last is doubt

135
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:46,320
so these are five specific states of mind that the the Buddha named as being

136
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,080
known for obscuring clarity the hindrances inhibit our ability to see

137
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:59,279
clearly they they cover over and Veil the mind but we usually don't even notice that

138
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,500
they're happening there's a way that

139
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,600
um they're they're almost sneaky in the way that we get hijacked by them but we

140
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,679
don't even know that they're present so by studying the hindrances we're actually taking a look at the veil and

141
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:24,000
we're taking a look at what inhibits the clarity of mind or we might say we are unveiling the

142
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,940
veil we're studying that which obscures so in this talk I'll share

143
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:36,960
a general singular practice that can we that can be used for working with all five of the hindrances can vote one size

144
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,059
fits all practice and then each day I'll go through through each hindrance one by

145
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:48,840
one to share some of the specific information about that hindrance and some particular ways of practicing with

146
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:55,380
each so today we'll be talking about sense desire in Pali that's Kama Chanda

147
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:00,720
and ways we might think of this hindrance include as we might think of

148
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,640
it as craving wanting to acquire things longing grasping

149
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,659
and this hindrance is at work when We crave food and drink when We crave

150
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:18,240
entertainment sexuality it can be mild or it can be

151
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,940
the force behind staggering addictions so since desire might be at work if

152
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:30,720
we're hankering for another Netflix episode or if we're decorating our

153
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:38,340
living space or if we're seeking pleasurable music or the perfect cup of coffee then it can even be active when

154
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,620
we're we're trying to recreate a blissful meditation experience so these

155
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:50,340
can all be expressions of sense desire so as you know we have five senses

156
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,500
seeing hearing smelling tasting touching in Buddhism we talk about six senses the

157
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:02,279
sixth being the mind the mind is considered a sense gate and thinking is the activity

158
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:08,158
um so sense desire is craving for Pleasant experiences at any of the sense

159
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,099
Gates um because the and because the mind can really conjure anything that lends

160
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:19,800
itself to fabricating things that we want it lends itself to fabricating the

161
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:27,720
idea of pleasant experiences Pleasant sense experiences so generally what's at the heart of our

162
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:34,500
sense desire is a feeling that something could make this moment better that this moment is insufficient and that

163
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:40,320
happiness resides in the next sense pleasure experience and in Western

164
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:47,820
culture there's this this kind of unspoken story of how to create a happy life like a happy life is when we can

165
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:55,440
string together enough back to back Pleasant moments almost like stringing beads onto a necklace

166
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,200
and avoiding all of the unpleasant moments and then that's that's what we call a happy life

167
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:08,580
um but of course we don't have much control over what's Pleasant and unpleasant and um as I touched on in the

168
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,859
meditation anything that's Pleasant passes away anyways

169
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:19,619
so now I do want to note that not all desires are a problem

170
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:25,619
you're wanting to be free from suffering uh to be compassionate wanting to be patient like these are actually

171
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:32,040
wholesome Desires in Pali Kusa La Chanda or dhamachanda and these can these can

172
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:37,740
refer to Wholesome Desires in contrast with tanha the word that's used to

173
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,500
describe describe craving that leads to suffering

174
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:48,420
and yet while not all desires should be let go of you know we don't want to get

175
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:54,000
rid of our desire for awakening or to be kind it's good to have the ability to

176
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,520
let go of them because we can still suffer even if we're we're grasping a wholesome desire

177
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:06,720
okay so now that I've shared just a a bit like the the lay of the land around

178
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:13,500
sense desire I want to share uh the the one size fits-all practice that you can apply to all the hindrances

179
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:20,400
um and if this is the only thing you take away this week um it will serve you well um so it has just two steps to it it's

180
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:27,060
really simple um and it's uh the first is to recognize and the second is to feel

181
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:33,720
um so that's what we're doing when a hindrance arises we're recognizing it and we're feeling it so the first

182
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:41,160
recognize we're recognizing what's present often when we're entranced by hindrance there's typically an object

183
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,099
we're fixated on and this is particularly true with desire and ill will the second hindrance you know we're

184
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:53,460
fixated on wanting a better apartment or feeling annoyed by a grumpy co-worker so

185
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:58,500
in these situations we're preoccupied with the object with the apartment or

186
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:05,220
with the co-worker then there tends to be a lot of mental proliferation about getting what's wanted or getting away

187
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:11,540
what from what's not wanted and and this is where the practice can be extremely beneficial in meditation

188
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:17,400
instead of just being lost in thoughts and then bringing the Mind back to the

189
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:24,300
breath if you notice the same theme coming up in the mind multiple times like oh that

190
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:30,480
restaurant thought again or um shopping thought or a sexual fantasy or whatever it is

191
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,000
um this is a great moment to practice this first step of recognition um and you might just ask you know is

192
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,220
there a hindrance present if you notice that track replaying or another way to

193
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:47,760
put this is um what's fueling this thought what's fueling this thought what's behind this

194
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:55,680
and then sometimes that can help us recognize the hindrance that that's operating below the mental proliferation

195
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,440
so we might realize oh this is sense desire or oh this is doubt and it's

196
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,660
really helpful to know a hindrance as a hindrance like to be aware that it's

197
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:12,780
present we're we're so often transfixed by the storyline of what we want or don't want

198
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:19,460
that we don't even know that the desire or the aversion are fueling the whole show

199
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:28,440
so sometimes just the act of naming something in this act of recognition

200
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,960
um makes it so something loses its power so sometimes if there's something within

201
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,780
us that's asking for attention to recognize it to identify it gives it the

202
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:46,020
attention it's been seeking and it can release the author and psychiatrist Dan Siegel

203
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:52,500
coined the phrasement and so sometimes there's a way that this

204
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:59,160
act of naming it can allow for release so so

205
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:06,060
um I have a chronic health issue and that and that health issue can make it so that for me digesting food can be

206
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:11,220
painful so if I eat one bite too much I'll often experience physical pain for

207
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:19,020
a number of hours so I have to have a really precise relationship with sense desire for food

208
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:24,500
and it's not uncommon that a food thought will arise in the mind maybe

209
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:31,140
maybe an image of an ice cream cone floats across the screen and if it's not

210
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:37,320
a time that I can eat that food the mind will pretty quickly recognize ah craving

211
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:43,859
and it will drop the um the thought and it will drop the associated craving so there's a way that

212
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:50,099
that recognition allows for a release and of course this Letting Go isn't

213
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:57,480
always available so in these cases simple recognition won't cause the hindrance to dispel so

214
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:04,800
then we have the opportunity to practice the Second Step so recognize and then secondly feel so we're feeling the

215
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,740
hindrance and specifically um in the body we get to know the

216
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:16,260
hindrance get curious about it and investigate what's going on

217
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:21,720
um so in this way of working with the hindrance with the hindrances we let go

218
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:27,540
of obsessing about the object and instead turn our attention 180

219
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:33,020
degrees to look inward at the desire at the aversion the restlessness the doubt

220
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:38,940
turning to look at those at um themselves so so this can begin to

221
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:45,660
pull us out of our trance out of our daydream rather than trying to get rid of the

222
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:54,420
hindrance we turn and look at it with an attitude of acceptance and openness we we recognize and we feel it

223
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:01,079
but I want to say just a little bit more about what I mean by feeling it um like how do we get curious about it

224
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:08,400
and get to know it um we feel feel the experience in the body like is there tightness is there

225
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:15,420
pressure is there tingling or heat so that's how what I mean by feeling it

226
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:20,460
and for sense desire there's often a contraction or tension in the body so

227
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:26,220
you might just see if that's present for you other ways we might feel the experiences

228
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:31,260
we might sense what sort of energy is in the body is it high or low energy maybe

229
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:37,560
a high frequency racing or on the other end of the spectrum maybe a heaviness or

230
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:43,560
drooping or lethargy and for sense desire for some people it

231
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:52,079
has a heightened energy to it because there's a motivation to get something there can be a forward lean

232
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:59,040
um so we might also feel the interested in the hindrance in the mind heart what's

233
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,500
the emotional tone um how does it color the mind oh what

234
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:11,940
does it make you want to do are there repeating thought patterns um so we're just we're exploring it when

235
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:18,200
we feel the hindrance so that's it two steps recognize and feel really easy

236
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:23,460
in in applying these to sense desire it can be really interesting because

237
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:29,760
sometimes sense desire at first glance can can present itself as being quite

238
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:36,060
enjoyable like we can get really excited about a home improvement project or

239
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:41,280
um or maybe there's a new purchase and the thought can have kind of a pleasant

240
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,500
Sparkle to it and under the surface as we begin to

241
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,720
investigate this further often what we find as the Mind becomes more settled is

242
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:59,520
that even that that state of craving itself um is a state that reflects a a sense of

243
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:07,880
insufficiency there's an underlying sense of not enough or of lack

244
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,900
so if you're having a hard time staying mindful of sense desire of doing this

245
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:22,980
practice of recognizing and feeling then you might try an antidote so an antidote is traditionally a

246
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:32,099
medicine taken to counteract a particular poison and this isn't any different so when do we apply an antidote to a

247
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:39,359
hindrance so when a person has become overwhelmed or has the sense of like I can't deal with this then it's time to

248
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:44,579
try something different so if you've practiced mindfulness of the hindrance for a while and it's not

249
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:51,480
softening then you might apply an antidote to just to help restore the Natural Balance of the Mind

250
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:57,000
so as we went over in our meditation today one of the antidotes for sense

251
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,280
desire is impermanence or inconstancy um you know whatever it is that we want

252
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,800
will pass away in time and in deeper meditation uh watching the passing away

253
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:16,619
of things to actually observe impermanence at work this can more more deeply mature our wisdom and and when we

254
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:23,760
understand at a deeper level how everything is falling away and changing it's really hard to be fooled by sense

255
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:31,940
desire because we know the pleasure will pass so so lastly and with all the hindrances

256
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:37,560
don't miss recognizing when they're absent um you know allow yourself to feel the

257
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:44,339
goodness of a mind that's free of sense desire and I mean allow yourself to register the felt sense the felt

258
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:50,819
experience of satisfaction and contentment because the more satisfaction you're present for in your

259
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:56,040
life the less likely it is that the mechanism of sense desire will need to

260
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:03,780
kick in to begin with so um so just maybe a moment of for a

261
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:10,920
moment I'll just mention Just a Touch about the attitude we're meeting the hindrances without judgment it's just a

262
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:17,099
neutral seeing with a wise Calm Mind of a grandmother like oh just desire just

263
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:24,180
craving it's okay so um during your day today I hope you're

264
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:29,400
able to recognize and feel any expressions of sense desire that might

265
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:36,000
arise for you and I hope you can do this with a sense of playfulness curiosity

266
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:45,440
and patience thank you so much for your attention this morning and I hope you have a lovely day take care
