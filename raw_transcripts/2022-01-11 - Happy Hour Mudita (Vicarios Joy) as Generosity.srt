1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,480
okay so so hello and welcome everyone to happy

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,599
hour so lovely to see you to be with you at this time wherever you are joining

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:21,520
from um this world and whatever the weather might be externally and internally wherever you

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,279
are so so for tonight's practice um

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,960
i'd like to invite our attention um to

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:41,680
to the joy of generosity joy of generosity in a particular way to actually treat

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,000
not just generosity because when i say generosity maybe what is conjured up in many people's minds is giving giving

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,760
money giving resources giving gifts i'm not just talking about that yes that

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:01,359
of course is one aspect of generosity but generosity includes so much more really it's

10
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,840
generosity of spirit generosity of our hearts and the way that we can give others the

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,880
benefit of the doubt in the way that say when we see

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,560
someone else's success we can feel happy for them even if it's

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,600
something that we would want we we don't say oh well i wish my name was there you

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,439
actually have this sense of generosity oh yay yay

15
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,079
feeling happy so mudita vicarious joy as an act of generosity of spirit

16
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,600
as if it were your own goodness as if it were your own

17
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:51,600
well-being your own happiness your own success because really

18
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:00,799
on the ultimate level there is no separation between you and

19
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,040
the other there is no self and the other or the given or the

20
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,760
gift or the receiver or the giver it's we we are so

21
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,159
intricately amazingly interconnected

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,080
that again through through our limited sense of this human life we see

23
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,400
our separation me you mine yours etc but and

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,000
and on an ultimate level it's all us

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,920
it's all this goodness this beauty of

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,640
of divinity of buddha nature whatever word you want to call it by that it

27
00:02:50,640 --> 00:03:00,159
expresses itself through these actions of kindness generosity goodness good will

28
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:09,120
so one way again that could be seen is that we do in in our limited perception until our

29
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,720
perception opens up or there might be many moments that actually our perception opens up and

30
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,480
maybe closes down again um that

31
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,599
we do we practice we keep practicing we incline our minds

32
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,360
as a way of expressing as a way of expressing this goodness this ultimate

33
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,760
goodness and beauty in all of us and

34
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,440
another way also to see that is that

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
generosity goodness beauty um

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,519
all these beautiful um

37
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,840
goodnesses in the world need to be expressed through us beings

38
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,200
so so in some ways it is said that divinity needs us to express itself

39
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,479
divinity buddha nature goodness god whatever words you want to put it needs

40
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:23,840
us humans to express love to express goodness to express

41
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,320
generosity to express giving others the benefit of the doubt so

42
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:39,680
so it is actually through our being and through are these seemingly small actions of every day

43
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,638
that goodness is co-created it is expressed in the world

44
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,199
so i'll pause there are so many ideas there these are some things i've been sitting

45
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,880
with um in my own practice so so

46
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,720
i'd like to invite you to let the words drop away now so much

47
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,759
and let's just practice let's just practice with some of these themes let's

48
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:16,400
practice with some of these themes that i will invite us and if you're new

49
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:25,120

71
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,880
receiving generosity offered to us

72
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:37,040
is just as important of having a generous heart

73
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,360
of generosity that gives both receiving and giving

74

81
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:46,240
a body that works well enough a mind that is clear enough

82
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:59,440

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:32,959
its goodness as an expression as a reflection

94
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:40,160
perhaps even as a wholesome

95
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,639
duty

96
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,800
to our inner goodness

97
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:06,000
by the nature or the divine whatever words we call it

98
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:19,240
tell our hearts to express co-create

99
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,880
goodness kindness generosity

100
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,799
by bringing to mind someone

101
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,919
who has some good fortune

102
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,960
perhaps starting with someone easy they don't have to have good fortune in

103
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,039
every aspect of their life but some aspect that's going well

104
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:59,320
and as if it were ours as if it were our happiness our goodness

105
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,280
celebrating

106
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:16,320
it is ours others happinesses are our happiness

107
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:23,120
for a moment what if we just dropped just simply dropped

108
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,760
the sense of separation it is our goodness it is our happiness to celebrate

109
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:38,399
it is our joy i am happy for you i am so happy for you

110
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,840

111
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,440
i wish you i wish your happiness to increase

112
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:59,039
i wish this happiness not yours or mine i wish this goodness to increase

113
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,919
i wish this goodness happiness to never end

114
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,320
may it continue made never cease

115
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,639
may grow

116
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:25,280
now if you wish maybe moving to someone was just a little more

117
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,840
challenging

118
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,559
still bringing to mind their good fortune [Music]

119
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:45,360
their gladness as if it were your own no separation this human family

120
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,320
and again if this relationship you're about to bring up there's been some hurt

121
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,360
not to condone

122
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:07,080
see perhaps unskillful and hurtful behavior

123
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,760
and can we still relate is it possible maybe not

124
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:27,120
this relationship in which case it's okay don't judge yourself but is it okay to still

125
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,799
relate to this person's humanity feel happy for their happiness good

126
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:40,480
fortune knowing that there might be some repair some forgiveness

127
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:46,400
it still needs work that isn't just swept under the carpet

128
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:53,600
it's acknowledged but we can still have spaciousness in heart i feel happy

129
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,400
for this being

130
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,320
you might be surprised

131
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,039
i'm happy for this happiness

132
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,039
for this good fortune

133
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,799
in the world made increase

134
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,158

taking your place as if it were my own

137
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:13,200
we are not so different you and i after all us human beings

138
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,759
we have so much more in common

139
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,320
in our humanity

140
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:37,760
having bodies that hurt that age that die

141
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:45,279
hopes aspirations challenges pain sorrow

142
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,600
i can be happy for your happiness for your goodness

143
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,080
may there be more of it for you

144
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,880
is it possible to see yourself in the shoes of the other person living

145
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:08,600
their life with their hopes and dreams their challenges their physicality

146
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:22,440
because life is so random you could have been born as them they could have been born as you

147
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:43,240
you could have had the same perspective on life as they do

148
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,480
opinions behavior

149
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,158
we are such a product of our environment

150
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,880
our culture or family upbringing

151
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,120
or genes

152
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:21,760
it is all dependently arisen dependent on

153
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,120
so many causes and conditions

154
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,880
can you take their perspective

155
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,840
even if so different from yours

156
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:03,840
from this perspective letting there be generosity of spirit of

157
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:11,559
heart as much as is available right now

158
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,840
for the last minute of this practice period

159
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,720
being generous towards yourself for whatever this practice period was or

160
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:39,679

162
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,840

163
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,359
[Music]

if there was an aha moment or if there was even something challenging or difficult it's

169
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:02,400
richard see your hand please am i unmuted yes you are unmuted

170
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,680
oh one of my teachers uh who loves to teach the perimeters

171
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:14,000
is always telling us that gratitude considers she considers gratitude the 11th paramate

172
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:22,079
and and when you were talking about receiving generosity it sort of it rang a bell for me as because she's

173
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:28,320
really getting it she really is having us get into gratitude practice all the time

174
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,000
yeah yeah great yeah it's it's so interesting because um

175
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,680
yes there's so many places that gratitude fits

176
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,720
in the practices i mean one one place is as you said this teacher who was putting it

177
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,160
as the 11th parame for those who may not be familiar with that terms

178
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,320
is 10 teachings the 10 perfections 10 qualities of the heart and also

179
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,920
so it's a perfection it's a beautiful quality of the heart also another couple of places and one

180
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:09,920
place that actually i usually put it is in the brahma viharas in the four brahma viharas with mudita with vicarious joy

181
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,119
when you feel happy for the happiness for the good fortune of others

182
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,280
when you turn it to yourself when you're happy for the good fortune of yourself

183
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,720
oh that's gratitude it becomes gratitude you become grateful there's no other way

184
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:34,079
to be happy for your own good fortune without it being expressed or felt as gratitude so so given that this is

185
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,839
happier and we covered brahma vihara's gratitude is definitely part of the brahma be heard so that's something else

186
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:48,640
for you to to bring in also to further further um plant

187
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,800
in your practice richard thank you bella i see your hand please and

188
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,720
there um i i was able to think of the first

189
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,000
person that they have joyful media for

190
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,119
the second person i wasn't able to come up with a distinct person that i knew was doing better or i knew how they were

191
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,160
doing and who i had difficulties with and i ended up cycling through a number

192
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:24,720
of people that i you know where i had maybe not the best relations

193
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:31,040
the odd thing was it actually came much easier than i i thought it would be possible so i don't know i followed instructions

194
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,640
but it actually went okay i love that bill that's fantastic that

195
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,079
is so great yay you know as

196
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:49,359
as you know by now these practices take um some creativity and i just love

197
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:55,359
that you didn't give up like well i don't have a person okay i'm done this is hard i can't you know like oh yeah

198
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:03,040
well let me let me try it in this other way let me kind of cycle through these people like great fantastic

199
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:09,599
inc creativity is absolutely uh encouraged and what i love about your

200
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,599
practice report is that it was easier than you thought like yes you could feel happy for this pers

201
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,680
for these persons that you had some you know a little bit of unresolved something with

202
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,520
beautiful what a lovely report thank you bill thank you

203
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:34,160
and debra i see your hand please well similarly

204
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,440
i but i found it sad that i couldn't find a lot of people in my

205
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:47,200
kind of in my close circle that are really thriving right now it's quite the opposite and

206
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:54,000
but what was helpful was toward the end you talked about just finding generosity for people and there

207
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,280
had been today a few people that really irked me just really

208
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,920
let me down you know and so then i realized oh i can use the generosity there too so

209
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,960
that was helpful nice but i had to search for people like way outside of my

210
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,320
people i don't even know you know like successful whatevers yeah and and i know

211
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:24,960
that if i knew them i would realize there probably wasn't anything to

212
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,320
to practice with because i think a lot of people you know having challenges so so this is what

213
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:38,079
i'll say actually deborah i appreciate that you brought this in and this is a line of invitation or instruction i fit

214
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:45,040
but it might have been just once and it might have gone unnoticed which was the person may not be happy in every

215
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:52,480
aspect of their life there could be just one aspect of their life that they're happy about so so that's what actually

216
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,599
makes this practice um work otherwise you're right if you

217
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:04,160
you know people well you love them and you know everybody has sorrows everybody has challenges it's there's not a single

218
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,240
person especially the time of the pandemic right and i was like oh yeah this is great and like me

219
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,240
your happiness in every aspect of your life increase so don't try to do the practice that way

220
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,920
don't because as you said that's the problem you would run into like yeah yeah

221
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,880
maybe slump some i don't know figures out there whose lives i don't really know yeah maybe they're happy but but

222
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:36,079
find someone for the first part of the practices that you know and and there's an aspect of

223
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:42,319
their life that's going well so yes maybe they're having financial trouble maybe

224
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:49,760
you know their health is not great but oh they're in this really loving relationship that really supports

225
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,280
them may your happiness continue may it never end so you see that that modification

226
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,200
there yeah and so may that help that work better for you yeah

227
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,280
great uh yeah so you you say you're if you want to add more you're welcome

228
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,560
to you found that you were happy for them yeah yeah i found that i couldn't find the

229
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:19,119
the places where i wasn't feeling happy for their happiness like yeah i would think of people that have

230
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:25,440
you know success in some area that i'm still working on but i do feel happy for them so it was really a stretch to like

231
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,640
say oh but i i mean i'm kind of thinking of it as jealousy i see i see i

232
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:37,119
understand now what you what what you're saying and the distinction i see it wasn't every aspect of their life it was that well

233
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,480
yeah even the things you would like in your life when they have them you're still happy for them beautiful

234
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,960
what a beautiful you know how beautiful to to to know and you already know it but also rediscover

235
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:55,280
reconnect with that generosity of your own heart wow even i even though i want this for myself i have hap you know i

236
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,960
can be generous with this i don't have to get jealous or envious or tight beautiful that's like it

237
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:08,480
happens though but it just didn't happen tonight i'm sure it happens i'm not you know perfect none of us are are perfectly enlightened

238
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,599
and and yet it's let's celebrate the areas let's celebrate the areas of our

239
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:20,000
heart that are generous yeah thank you for i know you're trying to bring in humility yes and and also let's help

240
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:28,078
celebrate beauty where there's melanie i see your hand we'll make this last comment before we go into groups

241
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:35,200
i'm amazed please everyone here is how you sort of generous and autonomous everyone is meanwhile i was like

242
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:41,599
struggling a bit um but i kind of had two examples and i noticed the difference in that one of them was like

243
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:48,000
the person i talked to um and it's very future looking like the thing that she has that was making her

244
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,119
happy i hope to like one day having the future and so then it was like really easy to

245
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,280
like feel very warm and comforted and it felt very like not zero-sum and then i noticed the contrast

246
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,040
with another question i was thinking of where i was like this should be easy i should be happy i felt stuck i was like

247
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:13,839
oh but i'm kind of annoyed because i used to have that thing and now i don't have it anymore and like should back

248
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:31,760
prevent me um there might be something there like it's

249
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:38,319
easier to you know like the difference of how it feels to

250
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:45,440
have to feel something that's gratitude but it's truly doesn't feel like a zero-sum game versus

251
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:52,920
you know when you do have those feelings it goes and it's interesting for me to see the contrast in myself

252
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:59,200
yeah interesting so thank you for sharing that so what i'm hearing says i went was future oriented there was a

253
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:06,240
sense of aspiration like oh yes i'm happy for what you have that inspires me whereas you notice like how interesting

254
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:12,880
when it's past oriented there's a sense of loss almost loss and

255
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,480
and um it's inviting you what i'm hearing and and correct me if there's more that you're saying that i'm missing

256
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:25,680
but but there's a sense of oh this is interesting you know it's not a zero-sum game i know that oh sweetheart what's

257
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:32,640
going on here like there's some curiosity is that what i'm hearing you say yeah yeah yeah beautiful yeah beautiful

258
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,920
investigation lovely thank you for sharing that yeah may you discover more

259
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,200
that in this non-zero sum game of of goodness in the

260
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,960
world so dear ones let's uh transition to

261
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,000
small group practice groups of roughly size three or so

262
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,640
and the invitation is to uh just uh we'll start with about

263
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,400
15 seconds of silence meta for one another and then you can share as little

264
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:13,040
or as as much as you like about your practice with each other really with generosity of spirit

265
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:19,040
generosity practicing we've been practicing with our eyes closed and silently but can you actually not do it

266
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,319
with a couple of other human beings practice generosity with a couple of

267
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:29,839
other human beings such a precious sandbox uh to be able to to do these

268
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:37,760
little groups so here we go i'm going to open the rooms take care of yourselves take care of each other

269
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:48,640
welcome back everyone the rooms are closed and we have just about a minute

270
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:55,280
so if there are any uh reflections that came up burning reflections you'd like to share you can type them in chat raise

271
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:02,240
your okay kneel i see your hand shut up go so how do you deal with someone who you

272
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:08,240
are in direct competition with right right where they're winning could

273
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:14,240
you know in some ways mean you're losing yeah yeah i i trust it's it's more

274
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:19,760
challenging right it feels more challenging so um [Music]

275
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,630
yeah it's um [Music]

276
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:32,000
i think it's it's a case where a different framing because if we enter

277
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,200
it as a zero-sum game of winners and loses you know if we enter it as a

278
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:43,839
finite game versus an infinite game are you familiar with the concept of finite versus infinite games yeah so if you

279
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:50,160
enter it as an as a finite game and set it up as winners and loses then that's a

280
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,280
that's a frame that is stuck for it's a particular perspective that is is valid

281
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:02,480
too and yet what i invite is actually shifting shifting and looking at it

282
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,760
slightly different there are ways to look at it differently also not to say

283
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:14,480
saying it the way of winning and losing is wrong is just one way what are some other ways

284
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,160
so look at it that way too i yes not not to negate it but are there other ways

285
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:26,240
that this could be seen as and this whole practice and not actually

286
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:33,359
practice in general is about ways of seeing the ways we see something so

287
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:40,240
i'm not going to give you a recipe but i'm going to invite creativity what are some other ways this could be seen and

288
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:47,119
this is a longer conversation and it's already 701 so so i'll just leave you with this invitation

289
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:52,240
not to negate this is one way yes valid worldly there

290
00:47:52,240 --> 00:48:00,079
are many other ways that it could be seen so i'm going to invite your creativity and and perspective shifting so maybe

291
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:05,359
we'll pick this up another time neil is that okay that's great thank you yeah thank you so

292
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:10,480
much so so dear ones we have come to the end of

293
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,800
yet another happy hour thank you so much for practicing with sango for cultivating

294
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:23,760
your heart for your own sake and the sake of all beings everywhere may all beings be happy may all beings be free

295
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,999
including ourselves [Music]
