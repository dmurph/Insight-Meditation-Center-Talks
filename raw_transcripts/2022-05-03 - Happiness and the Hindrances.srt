1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:08,799
so welcome welcome it's nice to be here practice together

2
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,640
so tonight i'd like to uh i'm going to start with this a little bit of a story that just

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,680
recently i had this pain in my arm

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,199
and it would bother me when i just did certain movements not other movements

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,840
but just particular ones i had no idea how this happened

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,839
i don't have any memory of doing anything in particular and it's kind of persistent and

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:54,718
i noticed that of course i just stopped doing certain movements because it was painful right kind of the

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,920
and then slowly it got resolved it resolved itself so it's a little bit of

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,200
a mystery but what's the interesting part is for me

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,840
it's interesting is that i didn't notice immediately when it went away

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,640
like often we don't notice but then my uh i did something that and i had

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,920
this memory like oh yeah i couldn't do this movement and at that moment when i

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,960
remembered oh yeah this used to hurt it doesn't hurt anymore there's this little bit of delight

14
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,400
like ah wow that's great you know kind of recognizing the stories

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,720
i had made about like why don't i know what this is and what should i do about it you're like there's all these stories

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,759
that accompanied this uh discomfort this little pain that i was

17
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:57,680
having and i didn't notice when i did when i didn't notice it

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,119
it just you know went on and like things were back to normal quote unquote

19
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,800
but when i did notice this sense of uplift this sense of delight

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,080
this little bit of happiness and so

21
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,599
it just reminded me that actually this fleeting flickering

22
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,920
sense of uplift or delight is a part of our experience

23
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,120
but we often kind of ignore it or dismiss it because it's

24
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,040
small or it's just maybe it just affirms how we think

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,440
things should be or something like this but this can be a support for our

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,840
practice this recognition of when something that's been troubling or difficult has

27
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,239
gone away and that little bit of sense of relief when it's gone away

28
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:05,360
can be a support and the buddha talked about this he uh

29
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,159
there's even a little bit of a a simile about this or a story about this and he

30
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:19,680
says suppose a person were sick suffering and gravely ill

31
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,800
they'd lose their appetite and get physically weak

32
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,440
i think back then you know thousands of years ago medicine was a lot about just food and you know what you did and

33
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,519
didn't eat you know and whether you were healthy or not is whether you had an appetite or not right

34
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,879
we can imagine right that a couple of thousand years ago their idea of medicine is different than what we have

35
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,159
now so suppose a person were sick suffering

36
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,280
and gravely ill they'd lose their appetite and get physically weak

37
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,560
but after some time they'd recover from that illness and

38
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,560
regain their appetite and their strength and thinking about this

39
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,200
they'd be filled with joy and happiness

40
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,879
so thinking remembering bringing to mind oh yeah

41
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:22,479
i used to be really sick i'm not so sick right now and just that feeling of

42
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:29,199
i'm using the word delight but maybe it's gladness or something like this happiness joy

43
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,440
these types of words and so and the buddha talked about this

44
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,960
experience of how it feels when difficulties end and a few colorful stories few colorful

45
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,840
little vignettes i'd like to share a few of them for me i kind of like to hear

46
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,720
it kind of like makes it a little more juicy and come alive to hear these uh

47
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,199
like this being painted a little bit more evocative with some of the language here

48
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,840
so the buddha says suppose a person who has gotten into

49
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,600
debt and then were to apply themselves to work and their efforts proved successful

50
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,320
they would pay off their original loan and have enough left over to support their family

51
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,759
thinking about this they'd be filled with joy and happiness so this feeling of debt and getting out

52
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:38,039
of debt and even having to be able to support others filled with joy and happiness

53
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,720
suppose a person were imprisoned in a jail

54
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:54,080
but after some time they were released from jail safe and sound with no loss of wealth

55
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:01,440
so maybe they didn't get fined so much or maybe people didn't steal everything while they were in jail but

56
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,840
they would become they would be released from jail safe and sound with no loss of wealth and

57
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,080
thinking about this they'd be filled with joy and happiness

58
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,800
suppose a person were a bond servant they belong to someone else or unable to

59
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,240
go where they wished but after some time they'd be freed from

60
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,280
servitude and become their own master an emancipated individual able to go

61
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:41,520
wherever they wished thinking about this they'd be filled with joy and happiness

62
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,280
are there's are there times in which we feel like we're the slaves to

63
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,919
i don't know just sometimes these social media companies that set it up to you know just click one more thing or

64
00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:00,400
do we feel like we're a slave to fashion or what are these you know all these types of things right

65
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,919
that kind of we get pushed around a little bit but then to notice when we're not pushed

66
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,120
around the ease that's available

67
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,800
suppose that we're a person with wealth and property who was traveling along a desert road

68
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,720
but after some time they crossed over the desert safe and sound with no loss

69
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:34,720
of wealth thinking about this they'd be filled with joy and happiness

70
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:42,400
sometimes we might have this idea right that there's a it feels really barren and

71
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,080
a lot of support or things that might be nourishing and we

72
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:55,120
have to traverse this area on this journey

73
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,080
so the buddha is listing all these occasions or these imaginations or these stories

74
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,800
in which a person is experiencing difficulties

75
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,120
and they all get kind of expressed as you know not being able to

76
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,840
go where you want to go or do what you want to do or kind of this oppression or constriction or

77
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:27,120
bondage or tightness of some sort and then when that difficulties

78
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,680
resolve they experience joy and happiness

79
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,518
so some of you might have recognized those stories those are the similes

80
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,120
that are used for the hindrances to describe the hindrances

81
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:52,399
that is these five energies these five habits these five

82
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,320
patterns that are part of human experience

83
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,920
part of everybody's human experience when they arise it is not a failing

84
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:12,640
it's not something we're doing wrong it's just what it means to be a human is to have some of these five patterns

85
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,080
the first one is sensual desire but like clinging to sensual desire grasping

86
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:25,279
craving for sensual desire this idea that i'm not going to be happy

87
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,399
until i have that double caramel triple chocolate

88
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,320
ice cream or you know whatever it is

89
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:42,480
and it's surprising right how often we're kind of pushed around by just wanting the next pleasant experience

90
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:50,560
of course we are i mean again this is another human thing right we don't want to be uncomfortable but

91
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,399
we live in a time in which advertising is just always trying to promise there's

92
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,160
going to be this next pleasant experience that's going to be so great just the next one's going to be really

93
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,959
great so this often is experienced as kind of like a leaning forward and i want more

94
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:18,079
give me more that's the first hindrance the second one is ill will or aversion

95
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,680
the flip side of wanting more is not wanting it at all

96
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,880
this turning away i don't want this get this away from me everything would be fine if

97
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:39,279
only this weren't here you know that kind of a habit or way to meet our experience

98
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:45,920
and to be sure sometimes this leaning into or averting away from these are natural

99
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,560
human things the and aren't necessarily a hindrance sometimes there can be wise and

100
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,200
appropriate but there's a it's a hindrance when it starts to turn into

101
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,240
well everything would just be fine if only this thing worked here and then i got to figure out how to do this and i

102
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,959
can't do that because of this but maybe if i move this over here then i can do that and then you know this kind of

103
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,480
i don't know in this business the story making that surrounds

104
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,760
the entrances here

105
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:31,839
so a third one is sloth intorper this kind of this fogginess this lethargy uh dullness

106
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:39,279
lack of brightness lack of energy lack of a certain vitality

107
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,320
it's also the fourth one restlessness and remorse

108
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,360
idea there's too much energy in this agitation and either in the body this feeling just

109
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:00,399
can't sit still fidgeting a lot or where the mind can't settle down

110
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,160
it's like maybe going over and over and over something rehearsing or

111
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,519
remembering or just being agitated in general

112
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:18,320
that's the fourth and the fifth is doubt skeptical doubt the type of doubt

113
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,120
that kind of like you have this feeling like well okay maybe i should do this no well okay no actually i should do

114
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,639
this well maybe i shouldn't do that because i have to do this first so then maybe i'll

115
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,680
do this other thing sometimes shows up in our practices

116
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,040
okay i'm gonna do mindfulness well maybe i should do some loving

117
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,720
kindness practice open up the heart a little bit

118
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,360
well okay yeah maybe mindfulness is better yeah but that person said concentration

119
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,079
is good then i'm gonna do concentration practice so this kind of not really settling down

120
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,040
so tonight i'd like to talk a little bit about this relationship between the

121
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:14,160
hindrances and joy happiness well-being

122
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,519
delight we could say obviously like okay well

123
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,560
the hindrances are like the opposite of uh happiness but

124
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:32,320
i'd like us to look at this a little more closely maybe that's not necessarily the case

125
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:39,760
that it's the opposite so there's of course a sense of well-being arises when we notice

126
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,880
that a hindrance has ended often we don't notice

127
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,880
but it works the other way also that cultivating a sense of well-being

128
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:57,600
and a really broad definition of that word that expression

129
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,079
can help us even while we're in the midst of hindrances can help us

130
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,120
have the find more ease with the entrances

131
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,880
and this isn't the usual way in which we kind of talk about the hindrances often we talk about okay if the

132
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,279
hindrance is this then you can do this specific thing

133
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:28,639
if there's sloth interpret tiredness you can open your eyes like is a typical example but i'd like to look at this a

134
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,680
little bit differently than the way that we often do

135
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,880
so as i was saying that something that all these entrances have

136
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,800
in common the sense of restriction

137
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,120
either like you it's there isn't the freedom to

138
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:01,040
experience or be open to whatever is going to be next and experience instead there's a sense of stuck

139
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:09,839
and a sense of being mired in our experience

140
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,240
and so in those five little vignettes often not often always there's one vignette

141
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,240
that's tied to a particular hindrance but sometimes i think it's maybe we don't

142
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,079
have to know exactly which one of those vignettes ties to exactly which hindrance

143
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,680
because there it might be just uh all of them might feel like a prison or

144
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,839
all of them might feel like you're going across this desert with no

145
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,839
and you're so thirsty and there's no water for you or something like this

146
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,959
so they all have this quality of this binding this

147
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,000
uncomfortableness and maybe just for final add a little

148
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:06,079
bit with the commentaries kind of add a little bit extra to the these vignettes and

149
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,759
for example says there is a person who has incurred

150
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:18,560
a debt but is unable to pay now if they're creditors

151
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,160
when telling the person to pay back the debt speaks roughly and harasses and

152
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:31,519
beats them the person in debt is unable to retaliate but has to bear it

153
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,759
like how many times have we seen this in the movies where you know somebody does a deal with a loan shark and then

154
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,880
the people come back and beat them up and the person they just have to run away they can't stand up for themselves

155
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,839
or and say no stop it you shouldn't be doing this

156
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,360
so there's a way in which there can feel like

157
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,199
we're being pushed around but the absence of the hindrances have

158
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:08,720
this quality of release this quality of freedom

159
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:15,678
and it may be really subtle it doesn't mean it's not there

160
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,199
doesn't mean it's not significant and doesn't mean it can't support our practice

161
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:28,079
to notice this feeling of release or freedom from the hindrances

162
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,600
and the commentaries add just as one who has freed themselves of

163
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,799
debt no longer feels fear or anxiety

164
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,960
when meeting their former creditors so that's kind of the describing of the

165
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,000
freedom is no longer having anxiety just this uncomfortable feeling

166
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,520
when the creditors show up

167
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:03,120
so i talked about how the hindrances are part of just the human experience

168
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,280
but maybe even not only that that if we're going to have a meditation practice

169
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,679
it's really a hindrance practice because the hindrances show up unless you're in

170
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,840
the jhanas all the time you're in some absorptive concentration state from the moment you sit down until

171
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,520
the moment you stand up the hindrances are going to be there so

172
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,679
those work together kind of like a meditation practice and working with the hindrances

173
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:40,559
and we can work with the hindrances by focusing on this part about the well-being the ease the joy and the

174
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:47,360
happiness so to kind of like demonstrate this i'll

175
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,280
talk a little bit about the first hindrance and i'm using the word first and second

176
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,880
just because there are typically you know a list this might not be the first one that arises of course

177
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:11,200
so oftentimes this craving for sensual pleasure when it shows up

178
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,080
in the context of our meditation practice and the context of our life

179
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,960
if we don't actually call it as craving for sench pleasure instead we

180
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:33,840
use this word i need i need this thing now i really need it

181
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,760
and right now these days you just go amazon.com click click click and there

182
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,600
you go right you get you can have like so many things right so there's this way and there's kind of

183
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:53,039
this reinforcement whatever you feel like you need you can get if you have the means and you're so disposed to

184
00:19:53,039 --> 00:20:01,679
do that this also kind of might fall into i need to take care of myself this way

185
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,840
i deserve it or you know whatever it might be

186
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:16,640
so what is there a way in which we can work with this sense of i need this and you

187
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,240
know within our relationship with the essential desires one that's not supportive that we

188
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,840
feel it's kind of pushing us around a little bit

189
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,600
one just recognize its present just turn towards like oh

190
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,880
yeah oh my thinking about what i'm gonna fix for dinner

191
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,760
is about sense desire and sometimes that can be really helpful just to name it

192
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:54,480
and that can take a little bit of the momentum out from behind it

193
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,600
sometimes just seeing it for what it is recognizing it

194
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,520
maybe that can soften it it's not always sufficient though to

195
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:14,480
make it go away and then next to do some investigation and inquiry

196
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:22,320
how does it feel like really feel to be having this experience

197
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,760
of wanting this experience of desire

198
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:36,320
and sometimes it can feel pleasant right in the beginning there's this vitality that shows up like yeah okay i want this

199
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,320
but then if we stick with this idea of feeling and investigating and

200
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,600
feel into it and we see that it's actually not a happy

201
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:54,320
state it's based on this idea of lack this idea of lack

202
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:01,360
or insufficiency or inadequacy or uncomfortableness or something like that

203
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,240
and so it actually is uncomfortable

204
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,159
but often we don't stick around or really pay attention to it so that we noticed

205
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:18,480
uncomfortableness we just go from one desire try to satisfy it then the next one try to satisfy it next one try

206
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,520
to satisfy it and our whole life ends up being this way let alone our meditation

207
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,720
periods so

208
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:36,480
there might be a it might be a subtle but often there is this contraction or

209
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,039
close closedness or maybe like this feeling of being in

210
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:49,039
servitude or being in debt like not quite free this kind of maybe oppressed

211
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:57,440
feeling and then when we feel recognize that

212
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,559
as best we can not to get um have aversion towards that

213
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:10,320
and this isn't necessarily our first impulse but can we

214
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:17,840
then turn towards any okayness what's happening

215
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,760
sometimes when there is some difficulty like in the previous instructions to tune into

216
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,039
or turn to the uncomfortableness there's a way in which our

217
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,640
awareness can kind of collapse around that switch uncomfortable

218
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:45,360
another way to say this is that which is uncomfortable just looms so large and kind of consumes our awareness

219
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:52,960
but instead can we maybe broaden our awareness

220
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:59,919
the uncomfortableness is still there but notice is there anything else that's

221
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,360
okay neutral or even pleasant

222
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,880
and this often takes a little bit of energy to kind of like open up

223
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,799
from this collapse kind of way in which we are with the difficulty but to open up

224
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:26,640
might be some neutral experiences in the body feet on the ground pressure of the cushion against the body

225
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:35,039
there might be a way in which we could pay attention to the breath and allow the breath to be really

226
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,880
soothing as comfortable as possible

227
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:50,000
maybe there's a way we could just relax the body notice oh is there any tension in the shoulders

228
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:56,320
maybe i can look at my posture and tuck my chin just a little bit make some space at the back

229
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,240
of my neck and that often kind of brings a little bit more ease in the posture

230
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,120
so to orient towards something that's neutral or even okay or comfortable

231
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,640
both in the body and in the mind

232
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:25,039
maybe one or the other might be more evident and so this does a few things one is it

233
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:31,520
interrupts this momentum of wanting this maybe doesn't make it go away but it

234
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,159
takes some of the momentum away from it

235
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,679
and it also reminds us that there's more than just this

236
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,240
particular experience that we're having there's a multitude of experiences

237
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,640
because this entrance in particular but many of them it can be like a

238
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,760
like in the buddhist tradition we have this uh story of the hungry ghosts that these

239
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,600
beings that are never satisfied right so they have this big belly and really small

240
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:16,799
throats so that doesn't they just can never get enough

241
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:22,840
nourishment they could just never get enough so in some ways it can feel like

242
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,759
that but if we are

243
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:34,320
locked into this idea that some sense experience is really going to be

244
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:41,960
satisfying it's gonna take care of that discomfort

245
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,640
then what we're actually doing is feeding the hungry ghost

246
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,799
mindset like oh i need to get one more sense experience one more sense experience one

247
00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:00,159
more sense experience and i'm encouraging us is there a way in which

248
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,520
we can look at something else that's not just another sense experience

249
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,960
that brings a little bit of okayness maybe even a little

250
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:19,200
delight or gladness relaxation in the body

251
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:27,440
letting the breath be pleasurable the way that we breathe tune into the rhythm of the breath

252
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,399
and then we could ask ourselves what is really

253
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:39,600
lacking in this moment like really

254
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,600
i'm sure we don't have the double decker chocolate thing but

255
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:53,679
this moment this this moment not just the past one and not the next one but this moment what's really lacking

256
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:01,360
and to tune into that that kind of also disrupts this idea of

257
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,559
this hungry ghost that gets created that can't ever be satisfied

258
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,760
but instead there's a little bit of a contentment

259
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,840
and again this might be really subtle it doesn't mean it's not there

260
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:24,080
for the sense of yeah okay okay i'm still breathing

261
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,840
this moment i'm still here and whatever sense of okayness

262
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:37,520
neutral is there and so learning to have this kind of a

263
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,360
wholesome kind of nourishment pleasure i'll say

264
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,919
is very powerful this can be transformative

265
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:56,640
not necessarily easy to train ourselves to look away from which is that is difficult because

266
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:03,919
right this is what humans do we have uh it's like the difficulties are a magnet and we just attracts our

267
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,440
attention and we can't let go of them and i don't know we just get a little bit

268
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:17,120
obsessed with them but if we can turn away a little bit

269
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,399
the hindrance the difficulty is still there we don't have to make it go away we don't have to solve it

270
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,679
but just notice what else is there that's neutral

271
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,880
and or even pleasant

272
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:38,399
and then we become kind of less infatuated with this idea that

273
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:45,278
something out there is going to make every make everything better

274
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,840
and instead we're cultivating something that is enormously powerful

275
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:58,720
this idea that's that we can [Music] be with our experiences and be present

276
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,279
in this moment this is allows us to be with something that's more fulfilling

277
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:11,600
more nourishing there's a more has a depth to it

278
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,440
and to train ourselves to do this takes time it's not something that we will do

279
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:24,240
immediately of course but it's really worth the time and the effort

280
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:32,880
because just like how the end of the entrances have some well-being joy and happiness

281
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,919
turning towards well-being helps to end the suffering it goes both ways

282
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,279
but we don't have to wait for the hindrances to go away completely

283
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:50,480
we can open up to what else is there and you may say

284
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:58,240
i don't know diana this sounds kind of odd really can we approach the entrances with us

285
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,720
and i'll say that there's uh lots of places in the sutas

286
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,960
where the hindrances are kind of like partnered with the same factors of awakening

287
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:17,440
the hindrances are what hinders gets in the way of freedom

288
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,799
awakening wisdom not to let alone you know getting

289
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:29,200
concentrated or seeing clearly or these types of things

290
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,760
so the hindrance is aptly named because they hinder that some factors of awakening are the ones

291
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:42,159
that support finding more freedom and ease support seeing clearly

292
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,440
support concentration and

293
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:54,559
one of the seven factors of awakening is joy and there's also concentration in there

294
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,679
so there's this way in which cultivating this joy and happiness

295
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:05,440
is part of the sem factor's awakening which is an antidote to that five entrances so that's kind of like a

296
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,559
buddhist list technical idea about this idea but or we could use the buddha's own

297
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:19,519
teachings to support this idea but i would just like to encourage that

298
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,200
to tune into to recognize that when there's a difficulty

299
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:32,320
and when it ends or subsides most of them do not all of them right

300
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:38,000
we do have aging this isn't going to end and some of us have illnesses that probably

301
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,039
aren't going to end right but notice that maybe when the severity

302
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:49,039
lessens or when there's difficulties when they end

303
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:55,760
there's a little bit of delight and use that as a reminder that we can cultivate delight

304
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,880
happiness well-being to help us with the difficulties and one

305
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,919
way to do that is to open up our experience and maybe loosen up the

306
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:14,320
the magnet the um i think rick hansen famously says right

307
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:22,000
so that uh they're like velcro the difficulties are like velcro we kind of get stuck to them

308
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:29,679
so can we loosen up that velcro a little bit and notice what else is here

309
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,799
so happiness and the hindrances one way that we can

310
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,840
work with these difficulties that arise in our life

311
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:51,600
so may you find plenty of opportunities to explore happiness and to experience it and allow

312
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:58,559
it to be a support for you and whatever difficulties are arising for you

313
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,080
and may that support us to also support others

314
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:10,720
so that we can be part of what makes this world

315
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,398
runs more smoothly or with more care with more warmth

316
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,638
thank you

317
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,679
you
