okay all right so welcome you all welcome everyone wonderful to see you

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:15,240
always happy making to come together um with the Sangha to practice so

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,619
for tonight's practice um the theme I'd like to invite us to practice with

4
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:29,939
um has been requested both on Friday when we had uh our happy hour at the end

5
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,040
I stayed a few minutes extra for those who were here and and a very important

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,500
question and conversation came came about about how to hold uh compassion

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:49,079
Equanimity with these hard practices with very very challenging times in the

8
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,300
world um if you're in Ukraine for example

9
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,620
um how would you how would you go about that how would you hold that in your heart and the same time also um another

10
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,979
aspect of what I want to bring in tonight is is a uh uh one of my students

11
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:14,400
sent me an email and actually I wanted to read part of their email asking

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,700
um and and as many of you know I am Iranian I was born in Iran and the very

13
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,280
challenging times right now in my uh in my country of birth so so they wrote in

14
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,740
your kind the student wrote and asked in your talks could you kindly suggest ways

15
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:38,520
for Buddhist Iranians and ukrainians who practice Metta how to use their daily

16
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,460
practice to bring more peace and love for themselves and

17
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,640
others around them during these challenging times also how to approach

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,579
activism with meta I so appreciate these questions because

19
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,579
this practice that we cultivate we do together five times a week it's not just

20
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:10,880
about easy times it's not just about sitting and wishing well it's also

21
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,280
irrelevant important or perhaps even the most important practice in challenging

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,420
times whether our heart is breaking with the news of the world

23
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,819
or if we are ourselves in challenging situations

24
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:37,190
um with with Injustice etc etc so so both how to hold it

25
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,840
[Music] um enabling transcription there somebody

26
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,200
asked you to enable transcription and I just did that um so

27
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,920
so with with this with I want to say a few words before we get into our

28
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,819
practice tonight and I so appreciate these questions and and the care that has has come

29
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:09,540
um with with the interest of how do we engage how do we engage so two aspects I

30
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,140
wanted to address very briefly before we get into the practice one is

31
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:23,239
this concept of compassionate activism compassionate activism

32
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,099
and activism with anger can be corrosive

33
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:36,780
and this is something that many activists in the world know anger can can bring up a lot of energy can can

34
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:45,840
bring up a lot of energy to do a lot in the world but it's also corrosive however being an

35
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,780
activist out of compassion it brings people together it it sees all

36
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,420
sides not to condone the harm not to condone the pain not to condone the

37
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,640
Injustice and the harm that's being done but one gets to see the humanity of all

38
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,159
sides again not to condone but compassionate activism

39
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,120
um is is is a way it really is the way

40
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,639
through this and just to say a little bit about my own reaction as I read the

41
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,880
news for example as I was reading the news from my homeland early earlier tonight

42
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,139
from the country of my birth um I was grieving and my heart was broken I

43
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:41,520
was grieving for hearing how peaceful activists in an elite University in Iran

44
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,419
were were um beaten up were taken away with a lot

45
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:54,360
of violence and what I noticed both in in what was

46
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:01,680
coming up for me was grieving for the pain of the people who were who were

47
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:09,900
hurt as well as grieving for the perpetrators for their karma for the pain that they

48
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:17,100
are causing so there is grief with compassionate activism there is a sense of grief and

49
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,440
sadness compassion for all sides it's not as separating of us against them of

50
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:29,639
course not condoning the harm and there there is action there is action but it

51
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,680
doesn't come from a place of hatred it comes from a place of and of course the

52
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,860
action might be this is not right this is not appropriate stop as a way of Defending

53
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,220
um and not allowing the harm to happen however it comes from a place of

54
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:54,600
of love for everyone involved not a place of hatred and I acknowledge that this is a very

55
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,699
very high bar to set and yet this is a high bar that

56
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:06,060
the Buddha sets in the um in the sitter

57
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:13,740
the simile of the saw where he says and I'm sorry this is very graphic uh

58
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,139
description but he says that if the bandits are are cutting off your arms

59
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:24,720
and legs still if you are following my teachings you

60
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,060
will have compassion you have Meta Even in that moment for them so for all sides

61
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,940
again you'll protect yourself you you won't be a you know oh yeah just do

62
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,639
anything you will protect yourself with all your might so compassion doesn't mean that you

63
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,220
become a wet noodle or you become submissive but that act of protection

64
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:54,120
that act of resistance comes from a place of of care and love

65
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:01,680
and similarly as one Witnesses what is happening with a sense of grief

66
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,160
and a broken heart with compassionate activism also comes the sense of

67
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:15,780
um a a need for holding oneself with with care because if if if you're

68
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:22,080
watching and you are off kilter

69
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,740
um there's there's not much that you can do you can't do your activism you can't be a force for the good in the world you

70
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:38,580
will be wallowing in grief you will just be lost in in grief and turmoil so there

71
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:44,819
are wisdom needs to come in to bring some Equanimity to hold the

72
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:50,940
compassion so that there is some stability to to have to be able to

73
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,060
engage in compassionate activism

74
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,259
so there's a lot more to say this feels

75
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:06,599
like such a brief and it might even bring up more questions than answers

76
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:13,259
but um I want to make sure we have enough time for our practice tonight our well

77
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:19,740
this is practice too listening to the Dharma and sharing the drama and yet I do want to make sure that we have time

78
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:25,979
for for meditating so let's let's turn to meditation and we'll have time for

79
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:32,640
discussion for questions afterwards okay so so I'd like to invite you to land

80
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,500
okay in your body

81
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:45,979
In This Moment In Time and this impermanent Moment In Time

82
00:08:52,920 --> 00:09:00,120
Landing arriving letting go of thoughts letting go of preoccupations for this

83
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,220
moment just so that you can settle

84
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:14,839
so that you can have an anchor so that you can have stability

85
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,420
to respond wisely compassionately to what arises in

86
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:29,880
the heart and in the world so for the benefit of a wise response

87
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:38,100
we choose to let go in this moment of of all thinking preoccupations

88
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,440
there's nothing wrong with thinking with planning

89
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,800
but in this moment we give him away and settle

90
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:57,120
In This Moment feeling the body stable well rooted

91
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,019
upright

92
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,080
a sense of Integrity in the body

93
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,880
the feet well rooted to the Earth connected to

94
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,240
the Earth as the Buddha said

95
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:31,800
with the gesture with the Earth mudra and the night of his Enlightenment as Earth be my witness

96
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,600
I am here I belong here

97
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:45,019
claiming reclaiming your place on this Earth

98
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,860
and letting your torso be upright

99
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:07,519
sense of Integrity ceiling sitting tall like a mountain

100
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:15,139
even if there's sadness if your heart is breaking

101
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,260
there is stability in the body to hold it all

102
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,000
stability in the posture

103
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:07,399
letting the breath letting the breath move through calm settle

104
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:14,279

stability

107
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,420

108
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,519

00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:32,158
transformed into a soothing light of Good Will compassion

163
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,220
breathing in breathing out cool calm

164
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,700
love care

165
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:03,240
and if this practice of breathing in or letting challenges be breathed Into the

166
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:11,700
Heart Center transformed and breathe out seems difficult this practice of Tong Len

167
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:17,120
and it's okay to breathe in peace and breathe out of peace

168
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,340
breathing in peace breathing out peace

169
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:51,299
if only this breath bring peace to those who are

170
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:58,220
suffering right now wishing well with each and every breath

171
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,419
so many people suffering

172
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:17,580
sharing care kindness good will compassion feels both the suffering but

173
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:26,900
and meets it with good will it's not just empath empathetic distress

174
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:33,919
breathing in peace breathing out Peace Love care

175
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:46,940
imagining that each breath is bringing Comfort soothing

176
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:55,080

177
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:02,840
soothing calming

178
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,440
all who are hurting

179
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,919
and if at any point it seems too much and the practice of compassion has

180
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:52,919
veered into empathic distress and it's no longer compassion but just feeling

181
00:24:52,919 --> 00:25:00,080
the pain it's okay to turn to your own heart

182
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,559
with compassion with care

183
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:19,220
feeling peace with each breath a sense of stability equanimity

184
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:27,620
expanding your view expanding the view of your heart

185
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,260

186
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:44,299

187
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,860

188
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:07,580

we have come a long way as humans we still have a long way to go

191
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:38,640

192
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,880

193
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:54,120

of Human Experience

195
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:09,919
the tide has been turning

196
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,100
of regenerations towards more compassion and wisdom

197
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:25,100
Humanity at Large is Kinder

198
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:33,960
historians philosophers tell us

199
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:43,620

00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:12,080
we are not so different from those whose ways we want to change

204
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,120

Radha

257
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:28,440
um first of all I just want to say thank you so much but uh um guidance

258
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:34,500
um and something that came up for me during it was

259
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:40,560
um this story that I remember um

260
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,560
of uh like from the Philippines kind of during the

261
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,500
um Marcus dictatorship um there was like this kind of Turning

262
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:58,020
Point in that um in the kind of overturning of the

263
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:05,820
dictatorship where um there were these sort of hundreds of thousands of women gathered

264
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:14,400
um kind of facing these soldiers and it was mostly kind of mothers of that age

265
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,920
and um um yeah they were facing these soldiers

266
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,440
and they just started chanting I love you to the soldiers and

267
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,680
um yeah it brings up a lot of emotion for me um and those

268
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:38,460
that was like a really big turning point in in um what happened kind of after that was

269
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:44,040
that the soldiers actually um Marcus actually lost support from

270
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:51,900
those soldiers um after that happened and um yeah the rest is history as they say

271
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:57,720
um that um yeah I just kind of found that coming up for me

272
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:05,700
I think during the meditation I was feeling a lot of kind of empathetic distress and

273
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:11,700
um I found kind of that energy of those mothers and that quality of the strength

274
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:17,160
of just you know just I love you um I found that kind of gave me a lot of

275
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:24,660
strength um so yeah I just wanted to shout out thank you so much Radha for sharing that

276
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:30,480
the powerful story and the turning point I'm so touched thank you also sharing

277
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,520
what what came up for you with this sense of feeling the

278
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,820
all sides both sides and really that sense of I love you and and that

279
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:48,060
can be the Turning Point may be the turning point I'm so happy to hear that was the turning point

280
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:53,820
when Marcus lost power and may be the turning point for what's happening in my

281
00:40:53,820 --> 00:41:01,160
country of birth may it be so through love not through hatred thank you Radha

282
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,540
Jamie please

283
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:14,460
thank you for this Nikki um boy just such big topics

284
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,500
it you know it actually is was fairly easy for me

285
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:28,260
to extend compassion to an oppressor or someone perpetrating violence because I

286
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,780
know there are conditions that led to their actions which makes me much more hopeless

287
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:41,220
actually because I don't I don't need to counter that person I need to counter the

288
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:47,400
conditions that led to his or her actions and that seems a lot more complex and a

289
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,440
lot harder it actually isn't and I'm so glad you raised this Jamie this is

290
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:59,520
fantastic because the cause and conditions that game rise to

291
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:06,060
what happened are three things greed hatred

292
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:11,220
and confusion and confusion delusion not knowing any better not knowing that you

293
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:19,740
know not knowing what causes happiness what causes goodness in the world so it's really these three right

294
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:26,040
and and I'm reminded of Joseph Goldstein who was watching um who who at some

295
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:32,160
point in one of his teachings shared that um watching uh uh documentaries of the

296
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,920
world wars it came up for him that really it's it the world wars all the

297
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,320
aggression all the killing and dying it's all the expression of these three

298
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:50,520
roots of greed hatred and delusion in individuals in individuals So when you say hopeless actually it makes me more

299
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:56,099
hopeful because here you are practicing love and and here when you see oh yeah I

300
00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:03,060
can I can love the perpetrator I can see the conditions you're already changing the conditions in you

301
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:08,099
so you're already dispelling greed hatred delusion and

302
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:14,280
that is Hope right there it's one person at a time I I'm not at a point right now

303
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,339
where I can see how those you know those three things um cause

304
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:25,200
all the all the um pain in in the you know that is

305
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:31,500
inflicted on people um it's um it just seems to me like a lot of the time it's

306
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,859
out of love for a parent who modeled Behavior

307
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:43,200
that was you know internalized and became embodied

308
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,920
with without ill intent necessarily yeah so I don't know what to do with that

309
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:57,119
so so I I have to admit the long uh chat came through and and there was a Crux of

310
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:03,420
something that you said that I missed so so repeat that I'm gonna it's hard to handle everything at the same time so

311
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:08,640
forgive me Jamie repeat tell me what is that part right and I don't want to I don't want to take all this time from

312
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:14,839
other people no but I do want to to hear the the um well I just think of um

313
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:23,520
uh let's let's take a soldier in in in in Iran who's who's you know beating a

314
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:30,420
protester um his actions might have been a result of

315
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:37,980
the love for his parents who had very strong uh beliefs and a certain set

316
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:45,660
of behavior that he took on board and emulated and internalized and I don't see how that is

317
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:52,619
read hatred or delusion yeah yeah it is delusion and let me thank so thank you

318
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:58,920
for repeating that so so this is what the delusion is the delusion is is

319
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:05,520
um not seeing the common Humanity that is a delusion when you don't see

320
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:11,700
that people the person you're hitting or beating is just like you but you're

321
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:19,560
beating them up and not seeing and not being able to take their place not being able to empathize and see and listen to

322
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:24,660
them and and othering that is a delusion

323
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:31,260
the delusion of othering in the fundamental sense list so thank

324
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:37,859
you for that Jamie thank you ah yeah

325
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:43,099
let's see okay Hugh says compassionate activism equals

326
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:50,220
non-violent resistance as taught by Martin Luther King Mahatma Gandhi and take not hot yes

327
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:55,380
and Dave says thank you Nikki it's tempting to

328
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:01,440
direct our gaze over there and point the finger of blame at an other especially

329
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,700
when the media are full of Stories of the official enemies du jour

330
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:13,020
but uh let's see but as as the land

331
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:18,720
acknowledgments remind us we are in the U.S are are seen as the perpetrators of

332
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,760
genocide genocidal violence before we accuse others let us take a look at

333
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:30,839
ourselves yes it's everywhere absolutely it's everywhere David's it's

334
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:36,060
um there is I I think once something that

335
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:43,140
your point points your note points out and I was also trying in taking perspective the big perspective of this

336
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:55,039
moment is a moment in The Wider Humanity in The Wider Humanity of of so much

337
00:46:55,160 --> 00:47:00,420
perpetration of violence Etc which has again as historians and philosophers

338
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:05,579
tell us we've become Kinder as humans and of course we still have a long way to go

339
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:10,920
and yet yes let's not turn our gaze there's there's plenty

340
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:17,220
um uh Karina what days do I teach I teach Monday Wednesday Friday and there was

341
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:25,800
one other question that came through let's see and I wonder actually it's 6 51 whether tonight given this topic it

342
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:31,560
makes sense to stay in the big group that's actually my feeling right now that we stay in big group and tonight we

343
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:39,720
skip the small breakouts and um that's my feeling if what's if let me know if

344
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:45,720
if you like the idea of staying in the big group give me a thumbs up or something and I'll count the number of

345
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:51,300
thumbs up if not yeah I'll see lots of thumbs okay we're going to stay in the big group tonight okay

346
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:58,920
uh so it'll take more more [Music] questions and Reflections

347
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:05,760
um I do want to go back to the question that was put in chat what should we wish for the knowing perpetrators of violence

348
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,980
and suffering oh I think in a way that was already handled I uh that came through Jamie's question so I appreciate

349
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:18,359
the person who wrote that it's really wish that they get to see and also it was reflected in radha's uh reflection

350
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:26,400
that they get to see that they're they are loved and they can love they see the common Humanity this is what I wish for

351
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,680
the perpetrators of violence past present and future

352
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:37,140
um a couple more messages gosh let's see I agree Stanford group thumbs up okay I

353
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:42,359
see that uh one person says thank you thank you I was able to do tanglin

354
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:50,099
tonight when in the past I couldn't great delighted to hear that Jerry I see your hand and then I'm gonna go to to

355
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:57,540
um actually let me read Jamie's comment maybe the delusion in the example they gave in the delusion example I gave of

356
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:03,359
the Iranian Soldier is not seeing that they have other options than the ones their parents and Role Models gave them

357
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:12,440
yep that too that too there's so many ways to see our common humanity and let lovely Jerry I see your hand please

358
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:19,140
just a comment I read in one of the new Services uh when the initial War started

359
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:25,619
in Ukraine at least in February was that um the Russian soldiers were finding it

360
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:32,700
hard to attack people that spoke their same language so this issue of course for me as a

361
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:38,460
psychiatrist is because they see them as human beings and they're not speaking gibberish to them because they're

362
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:44,339
speaking the language of Russian that both of them overlap and so it did get

363
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:50,460
to me about your question your comment uh about well the delusion is is that

364
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:56,400
they um it helps that you don't you to dehumanize the person that you're

365
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,700
attacking so that's my only comment exactly and yeah that is the the

366
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:10,380
delusion of the humanizing of of othering they're different they're bad they you know whatever uh different

367
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:17,040
narratives right and that's how um anyway it's it's happened so often in

368
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:23,579
the history of of humanity unfortunately one group the human incises is the other

369
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:28,859
or maybe the people empowered to to that do that to stay in power

370
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:36,599
um a couple of comments from YouTube and I see Serena and Charles Lee's hand um John says on YouTube the challenges

371
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:42,420
that are so real in the northern hemisphere seem a long away from New Zealand so thanks for guidance to be

372
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:47,880
there now with love for all the people there and here thank you John for joining from New Zealand really

373
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,980
appreciate um so Serena I'm gonna ask you to unmute

374
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,280
please

375
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:04,260
yes thank you it was really difficult I have to say that to be honest with you

376
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:09,780
was very difficult tonight's meditation was very difficult for me

377
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:14,880
and um what I'm really very aware of is that

378
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,040
um it is really tough to deal with suffering

379
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:25,140
and in any shape or form you know I

380
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:33,059
I'm having you know it's like um yesterday I had to go and visit my uncle

381
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:40,800
well I chose to do that who is in um in a nursing home type of facility he

382
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:46,200
hasn't been doing well for a long time and um

383
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:52,440
I had to really get my courage up to really go and visit and to be with

384
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:59,880
somebody who has very little control over over his body and to be there for him

385
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:07,140
so um so what I'm trying to say is in my own

386
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:14,460
personal life I'm just having difficulty just being there for other people who are

387
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:21,780
and you know suffering or are in very very difficult situations and

388
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:28,920
um and honestly you know like for example when the war and in Ukraine uh happened

389
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:36,720
I was really activated I sent things I you know medical supplies Etc but it's

390
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:43,920
just like it's hard I get your I get your questions Serena so so in the benefit of time given the two other people also have their hands raised I I

391
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,380
hear you this is hard this is hard people are suffering and as you said it

392
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:54,420
already takes a lot of courage to be with suffering which is close that is

393
00:52:54,420 --> 00:53:00,599
close to you people you care about close to you and and and so how to it seems

394
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:06,300
It's all it seems overwhelming right so so this is what I recommend as a

395
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:11,339
practice for you to have to build that courage to build that stability for you

396
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:16,440
to all to both be with people who are close to you to show up for them and yay

397
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:22,319
for doing so and people that are far away is to when it starts to feel

398
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:28,380
overwhelming to back into or to um to to

399
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:34,920
um support yourself with Equanimity with expanding your view get your balance get

400
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:40,980
a sense of stability and that's what we did tonight and I know it was a hard practice and I went back and forth

401
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:48,599
between Equanimity stabilizing on the Equanimity and then when there's a sense of okay peace is yes and then opening up

402
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:55,140
again titrating and again oh this is overwhelming going back to Equanimity that's the way then you can expand your

403
00:53:55,140 --> 00:54:02,160
capacity Serena to be with suffering it's not going to happen overnight but little by little you're going to expand

404
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:07,319
your capacity and it will both serve you as a in your own humanity and serve

405
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:14,339
others thank you for raising that appreciate it thank you thank you thank you Charles Lee please

406
00:54:14,339 --> 00:54:20,579
oh hi yeah thanks Nikki thank you again um I guess what what stood out for me

407
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:25,619
during during practice was really the comments about

408
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:31,020
um I guess or the rejoinder about uh myself

409
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:37,619
um you know may may others you know not have suffering um or all beings not have suffering and

410
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:42,839
you know including myself and I just uh really felt it uh uh this evening and

411
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:48,119
just uh just a good reminder um to

412
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:55,500
um I guess to in some ways be selfish but not in a you know in in a skillful

413
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:01,380
Wholesome Way allows me to show up um a lot better for my family and I've

414
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:07,440
had to tell my kids you know Daddy needs to eat something before he can help you

415
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:15,319
give him five minutes to get some calories it'll be a much nicer Daddy

416
00:55:15,319 --> 00:55:20,400
beautiful beautiful I love that thank you charlesly thank you so much for

417
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:28,740
bringing that into the space it is so important um it's wise selfishness let's call it

418
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:34,319
you know or maybe another word I it's it's wise

419
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:41,819
it's wise taking care of oneself I mean really you have to take care of yourself before you take care of others and in

420
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:48,599
this guided meditation of course you need to be included compassion is 360.

421
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:56,400
specially if you feel that oh yes this over well means too much okay come back calm sweetheart it's okay it's okay it's

422
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:02,420
all right calm soothing because if if you don't have the capacity if you are

423
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:07,920
uncapacitated you can't be available for anyone so of course you have to take

424
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:15,180
care of yourself so thank you so much for highlighting that and that's so important in compassionate activism and

425
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:21,359
just caring for others caring for your family beautiful thanks again and Diana
