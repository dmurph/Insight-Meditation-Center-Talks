00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,920
to explore the practice of mudita mudita

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:21,760
in pali m-u-d-i-t-a um translated often as vicarious joy

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,599
sympathetic joy basically it's happiness for another

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:36,320
being's happiness happiness for another being's happiness which is um a wonderful way for us for our hearts

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,480
to to light up to feel happy for circumstances of happiness whether it's

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,480
somebody else whether it's external or internal internal will be expressed as gratitude usually modita

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,840
becomes gratitude external is this joy for another person's joy

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:01,760
taking delight in someone else's good fortune yay yay and

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:09,119
one you know i've been talking and diana has been talking about mudita so so i won't repeat every all the other

11
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,119
things i've been saying at the beginning of the previous sessions but a new thing i want to introduce a new idea i want to

12
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,680
introduce tonight for our consideration about this practice is

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,479
sometimes people wonder and ask what is the relationship between wisdom

14
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:35,439
practices such as vipassana mindfulness seeing things as they are practicing

15
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:44,320
with seeing say impermanence etc the wisdom practices what's the relationship between those and the heart practices

16
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:51,040
metta mudita karuna compassion loving-kindness vicarious joy

17
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,439
and of course they support each other and in many ways there are one and the same when you really deeply

18
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:05,119
practice insight it opens up to love and compassion and happiness for all beings uh good fortune

19
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,959
it just and then the other way around when you deeply practice these practices of the

20
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,000
heart ah there's a sense of presence and seeing

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,440
the way things are it lights up for you it becomes easier to see so so what i want to point

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,520
out is as wisdom when when our hearts opens up to the wisdom

23
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,319
of selflessness of the sense of yes there is the self we take care of it of course it's important

24
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:44,080
we bathe it and feed it and yet as we succeed in not always being so

25
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,440
self-centered in our regard we pop out of that ah there's a sense of

26
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,160
ease there can be a sense of um lightness if we don't keep

27
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,640
uh worrying about the gain and loss of just this person that is me but when we expand our vision

28
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,879
through wisdom practices then there's a sense of opening

29
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,920
to gladness of other people when when we're not just comparing oh is

30
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,120
my gladness more than their gladness it's just happiness in the world there's this from

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,319
the perspective of the enlightened mind and if if when i say that you think well

32

whatever it might be

119
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,440
maybe imagining a blessing if the person seems healthy

120
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,080
oh if they're walking around or if they have a job

to connect with the sense of generosity of spirit of happiness for others happiness

135
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:11,840
maybe you see yourself as a little fairy with wings flying about and seeing different

136
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:19,039
people in the world and their good fortune and how happy they are

137
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:25,840
maybe as they hug their young child whom they love and ah

138
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:39,840
you feel happy for their blessing for their happiness as if you are feeling it yourself as if it were your own

139
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,480
and staying with a neutral person whomever you choose for for a little while

140
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:07,840
before moving to the next person staying with them for a while

i'm happy for your happiness they take delight

142
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:03,840
in your joy as if it were my own

143
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,159
and at any point if the opposite comes up sense of envy

144
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:22,000
the far enemy it's okay this is the purification practice

145
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:30,960
turn to it with mitta with kindness supporting yourself with compassion

146
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,360
it's okay holding your own heart with

147
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
care

148
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,080

151
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,840
sharing our goodwill

152
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,880
for a neutral random person in the world we don't really know very well

153

happiness blessing did come easy was it challenging

201
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,240
um did it the framing this way which was a little different i'm actually

202
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:02,560
feeling into this expansiveness as if you're a little angel or a little butterfly with wings

203
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:11,838
just kind of expensive did you try that on for size did that work for you did it not

204
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:27,040
oh lovely thank you don says thank you nikki feeling joy for others

205
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:35,520
was liberating they are just like me oh beautiful thank you for sharing that dawn i love

206
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:42,480
this as you talk about it was liberating the sense of liberation feeling joy and seeing the common

207
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,240
humanity feeling joy for others was liberating beautiful

208
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:57,520
lovely yes carlo i do see your hand usually i

209
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:06,880
don't see people's hand but for you i do hold and i'm gonna ask you to unmute there you go

210
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,440
one thing that worked really well for me was when you said um thinking about the other person's

211
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,480
uh complexities that they have the complexities the same as i do

212
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,079
to think of people as three-dimensional just like like me that

213
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,920
helped uh unleash some good will towards this neutral person

214
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,119
and to see them as a complete human being instead of just a little bit i know

215
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:41,440
about them right yeah thank you carla thanks for sharing that and as you're saying that i was

216
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,560
seeing some heads nod in agreement with you yeah thanks for sharing

217
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,000
yeah that's that can be key and we can take that then into our lives oh there's

218
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,240
so little we know about these other human beings they have a life just as compelling as ours

219
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,160
wow right it's obvious in some ways but we don't consider it it's interest

220
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,160
it's profound and eric says i really appreciate it that we meditated on our

221
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:17,839
blessings it reminded me that amidst any situation there are still blessings yes thank you indeed many

222
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:22,960
blessings one reflection directly to me um

223
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:31,200
so um i you don't say the names if you're directly to me unless you want them to be public feeling so lucky to

224
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:38,319
have had this refuge of love and kindness during the pandemic providing constant love out to this

225
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:46,560
hurting world oh thank you that's such a lovely reflection so delighted that you're part of this

226
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:52,960
this community and you keep coming practicing and sharing this constant love to this hurting world and this

227
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,079
uh container and um

228
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:05,119
and terry says i wonder about the sensation that arises from me when contemplating joy it seems to be

229
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:13,920
closely related to a deep sadness as well are there are they related emotions um

230
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,640
so when contemplating seems to be closely related to deep sadness is it okay if i ask you to say a little

231
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,680
more about this i'm i'm um not you may want to say

232
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,880
so that i understand what it is you're referring to uh if you could unmute yourself please

233
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:41,599
terry yeah it's um sort of hard to explain but

234
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:49,440
these things often are yeah yeah um you know tears well up a deep feeling in

235
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,520
my heart wells up and maybe i'm not understanding maybe i

236
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:03,920
haven't practiced joy enough i certainly it's not a natural or it's some dealing with deep

237
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:10,160
depression most of the time maybe it's that i don't know maybe it's so

238
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,880
opposite of what i normally feel then yeah yeah thank you for for adding all

239
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,800
the nuances which are actually beautiful and tender so i don't know and so i'm going to

240
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:29,359
uh invite you to some investigate some some curiosity to kind of sit with because it

241
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,480
might be that there is a tenderness that so it's not

242
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:40,880
it's not necessarily because what you're describing sounded to me like tearful tenderness that the joy can feel

243
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:49,040
so tender like sometimes joy can feel tender when um kind of moist you know like

244
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,720
when you look at the little child or maybe a newborn it's like oh my gosh it's so precious there's the happiness

245
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,800
but yes it's tender like your eyes get moist so i wonder also maybe it's that as it's

246
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:08,000
finding its way as you were saying in the territory of touching into sadness which might be habitual and kind of finding

247
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,359
its way to unbridled joy it's kind of like finding its territory through

248
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:19,200
tenderness through sadness through unbridled joy so it's kind of an exploration i wonder

249
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:25,280
terry how does that land for you yeah that really strikes my curiosity in

250
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,839
me too like huh yeah it could definitely be

251
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:37,520
tenderness yeah and stay with it and be curious and and oh yeah joyful and it's okay it's

252
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:44,720
okay um yeah great thank you for sharing that beautiful thank you and matthew will let

253
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:51,280
this be the last comment before we go into uh the groups yes matthew please i just

254
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,319
wanted to add on to that and that i feel like

255
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:03,760
a lot of these emotions are kind of like different sides of the same coin and that the heart of him is really like

256
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:10,800
a feeling of like sincerity maybe would be how i describe it and so it's like when

257
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,480
you feel something sincerely it can very quickly change from

258
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:23,920
like joy to even like to like compassion or sadness it's like it's like the core of them is

259
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:29,440
sort of similar and it's that feeling of just like it's that feeling of sincerity which

260
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,040
and so it's like if there's a sad tint to it it's sad but you're sincere about it and then if it's happy it's it's

261
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,240
happy but then you're happy about it or something uh and it but it's all of it is a core

262
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:46,640
of uh sincerity and it's like a level that i think that you know a lot of times

263
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:52,319
you're kind of on the surface and so then sincerity it's it feels like sincerity yeah yeah

264
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:59,280
i appreciate the this whole heart and the sincerity theme you're bringing and what i'll add to it what you brought

265
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:06,640
in here in this context of practicing these different brahmavir heritages as long as we meet them with kindness

266
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:13,280
with with care with warmth with as long as say that sadness is held with

267
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:20,160
kindness ah yes it's hell big is hell with compassion when the when the happiness is held with

268
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:26,480
kindness it it becomes a celeb celebratory wholehearted celebration of goodness and

269
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,839
gladness so that's where they keep their wholehearted balance in this practice

270
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:38,400
instead of veering into the the the challenging aspect yeah thank you beautiful and
