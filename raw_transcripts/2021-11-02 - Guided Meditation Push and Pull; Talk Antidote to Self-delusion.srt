1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:09,519
getting back into the swing of things after not having been here for a number of weeks it's great to be back

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,360
and maybe i'll say a few words about what we can expect going forward

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,760
excuse me that is oh hold on to second

4
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,440
okay so going forward starting next monday

5
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,640
gail franstall and i will be sharing this monday night at 7 30 time slot

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,920
and it will be open the meditation hall will be open

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,879
so it'll be a combination will be both on youtube and live in person

8
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,559
and how we're doing live in person right now is individuals sign up

9
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:11,439
so that to attend and just so that we have a control over the amount of people here

10
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,880
so that we can maintain some social distancing

11
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,560
and they ask that you upload a vaccination card and once that's done then you can sign

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:30,720
up for monday nights and sunday mornings i think they're the limit is about 25

13
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,000
people so i'm i'm looking around the room right now there's little uh

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,159
blue tape on the carpet where the individuals can sit and so that

15
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,640
there's plenty of space and maybe just to for those of you who have been here to

16
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,960
imc just to give you a little uh frame of reference 25 people

17
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,040
is a little bit less than half than if this room were filled so just to give

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,560
you a little sense of that so perhaps i'll be seeing some of you

19
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,120
in person but otherwise we'll still be here on youtube

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,239
okay okay

21
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,480
so a really warm welcome really warm welcome to everybody

22
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,120
what a pleasure it is to be here

23
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,800
yeah so we'll begin with a guided meditation

24
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:54,000
in general i don't like to have too many words during these meditations but just

25
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,680
an encouragement to maybe incline the mind a certain way

26
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,120
so taking an alert posture

27
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,400
a poster that reflects your intention to meditate

28
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,799
to be present

29
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,760
as well as having some ease as well as having some softness rather

30
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,040
than too much stiffness

31
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:58,480
and then checking in with the body what is it like to be

32
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,120
in this body at this moment

33
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,040
can we sit and know we're sitting

34
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,720
maybe the body is a little bit tired a little bit restless

35
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,560
however it might be can we make room can we allow

36
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,479
the experience as best we can

37
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,520
and allowing our attention to rest on the sensations of breathing

38
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,960
without pouncing on the breath without ignoring the breath

39
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,560
but with some gentle noticing

40
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,600
gentle in the sense that we're not grabbing on

41
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,039
but we are connecting with the breath

42
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:29,479
the movements of the body associated with breathing

43
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:28,960
connecting with feeling the expansion the contraction

44
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,840
of breathing

45
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,640
we can characterize our experience

46
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:44,080
of when we're not on the breath this may be either being pulled towards

47
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,760
something else that seems desirable

48
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:57,120
or being pushed away from something that's not desirable

49
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,480
this push and pull

50
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,480
it can be helpful to just acknowledge oh yes there's a pull

51
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,839
towards something i want

52
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,920
or i push away from something i don't want

53
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,320
sometimes just noticing that movement push or pull

54
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,080
can help weaken the pushing or pulling

55
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,160
make it a little bit easier to come back to the breath

56
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:16,160
we might notice but it's the habit to do a little more

57
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,120
pushing or a little bit more pulling

58
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:28,959
are we moving towards something we want or away from something we don't want

59
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:35,959
when we're no longer being mindful of the sensations of breathing

60
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,040
it can be empowering to notice our habits of mind

61
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,320
you don't have to make a big story

62
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,360
it's just a habit of mind

63
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,880
this idea of noticing

64
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:54,080
whether the mind is pulled towards something or pushed

65
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:02,799
away is just a tool to help us

66
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:10,840
understand our minds the habits of mind

67
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:28,759
a way for us to tune into the movements of the mind

68
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:44,480
so that we might understand ourselves better

69
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:54,559
but understand the way this particular mind works or

70
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,120
likes to work

71
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,760
so then we might be alert to some of the ways in which we might not

72
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:16,559
be seen clearly if we're always being pulled

73
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:22,480
towards something maybe that means we're

74
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:30,200
not noticing fully what's present here in the moment

75
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:40,080
there's this idea that something better is out there or if we do feel like we have to get

76
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,840
away from something is there a way we might look to see if

77
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,960
there is a sense of security or safety or stability already here

78
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,960
and whatever we discover is perfectly fine perfectly fine

79
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,399
the practice is to just notice

80
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,559
and as best we can do not have a big story about it

81
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:22,520
just notice this is the habits of this mind

82
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,919
so that we can have some more ease

83
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:39,279
and if we have more ease we can show up in the world

84
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:45,760
in a way that supports everybody ourselves

85
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,600
and those we come in contact with

86
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,720
so maybe this practice that we share this practice that we do

87
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:03,799
may it be for the benefit of all beings everywhere

88
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,059
[Music]

89
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,559
so welcome welcome it's nice to practice together

90
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,120
today i'm joined by my good friend who's here in the hall with me

91
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,480
the two of us we have this whole hall together and all of you there on the other side

92
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,200
of that camera

93
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:22,320
so with this practice you might have heard or sometimes um

94
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,720
i know that i've said in different settings that part of this practice the goal of

95
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,919
practice maybe we might say is to see things as they really are

96
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:40,559
yata buddha as they really are kind of like that the truth of the moment

97
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:48,159
not how we're wish that they were or that we're imagining how they might be but how they really are

98
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,440
and the tradition tells us that the way things really are

99
00:31:53,440 --> 00:32:00,960
are impermanent unsatisfactory and without a self at the center of it all

100
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,600
aneecha

101
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:12,080
and then the idea is and the teachings are and certainly this has been my experience

102
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,600
that when there is this recognition of the truth of how things are

103
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:24,159
impermanent unsatisfactory without a steady self at the center of

104
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,279
everything then there's a just this natural letting go

105
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:35,360
that arises it just doesn't seem just doesn't make sense to hold on

106
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,480
it's less maybe a logic and more just uh recognition like yeah it just doesn't

107
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,799
make sense to hold on and so there's a letting go

108
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:54,240
and this letting go can bring greater freedom so we might ask well why is it if

109
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:01,360
there's the truth of impermanence not self and suffering why can't i see it all the time why do

110
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:09,000
we have to do all this meditation and dharma talks and study and all this work

111
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:18,320
well maybe i'll say a little bit more because we also have this idea of

112
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,440
the four noble truths maybe some different truths here

113
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:29,760
the truth is suffering but also the truth of its cause its cessation

114
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:37,600
and the way the path leading to this cessation and these have this title noble truth so

115
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,559
these feel like really important truths and certainly they are foundational to the buddhist teachings and buddhist

116
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:50,880
practice and these truths overlap with

117
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,159
some of those other truths about anita anata dukkha

118
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,480
impermanence not self suffering

119
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:11,599
so we might begin to think that okay this idea about truth is an integral part is an important part of practice

120
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,200
and recently i've heard in a number of different settings also this um

121
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,200
story i'll say or that the tradition holds that you know the buddha had

122
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,480
countless lives past lives before he became a

123
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:35,200
buddha and he's reborn and all these different venues or settings

124
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:42,000
and it is said that despite these hundreds thousands untold number i don't know how many i don't know if maybe the

125
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,358
nobody knows that uh the buddha never told a lie throughout all these rebirths

126
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,800
because truth is so important that even though he might have

127
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:02,560
done some other transgressions he didn't tell a lie i've heard this a number of times

128
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,680
including just recently just as a little aside i'll say it's not

129
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:14,320
that itself is not actually true that there is a uh jataka story

130
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,839
that jataka jataka 3 42 that um

131
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:26,000
when the bodhisattva so before he was a buddha in that particular life he was a monkey

132
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,000
and uh he was just deceived a crocodile in that story so just as a little aside

133
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,079
uh it turns out that uh that buddha in one of his past lives according to these jadaka tales in fact

134
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:47,040
did lie but nevertheless the tradition believes and holds that it's so important

135
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:53,359
that they have this tradition that he didn't lie so we might be led to believe that this

136
00:35:53,359 --> 00:36:00,320
practice is about getting to the truth and certainly that feels good right that

137
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,079
we want to know what the truth is we don't want to be following lies or something like this

138
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:12,400
and maybe we even have this idea it's the truth with a capital t

139
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:19,440
the truth but this type of thinking lends itself to the idea that there's a

140
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,720
truth that's out there somewhere and

141
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:31,599
that we have to discover it and find it and it's certainly the practice is about that but

142
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,880
one way that if we were to do this it can leave us feeling maybe

143
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,960
disconnected that there's some great truth out there there's me over here and

144
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,320
out over there is something that i'm supposed to discover

145
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:55,520
and this is a legitimate way to consider buddhist philosophy certainly but in this tradition we were

146
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,599
really highlighting practice

147
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:09,838
so the truth is naturally necessarily subjective

148
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,680
it's the truth of the things as we experience them so we can try to say how things are out

149
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:24,320
there quote unquote but when the mind always makes sense of

150
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,560
the world through perceptions and through the lenses of conditioning

151
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:39,119
so my experience at any moment is not going to be exactly the same as anybody else's experience

152
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,640
and in this early buddhism the buddha is not concerned with

153
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,760
the stat that we could say the ontological status of things that is to

154
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,839
say whether how things exist independent of any humans interacting

155
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:02,240
with them instead this practice really focuses on

156
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,240
the truth of our experience the truth of the moment in fact we might even say that

157
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,560
mindfulness practice it was really a practice to help us tune into and align with

158
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:21,599
this moment the truth of this moment the reality of this moment

159
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,800
so instead of approaching this idea of truth from this idea that it's something to be had out

160
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,160
there somewhere but instead turn it around

161
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,200
think about it's more as the truth

162
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,400
as an antidote to

163
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:52,240
the self-delusion as a way to help us see our experience clearly

164
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,720
help us see ourselves clearly

165
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:04,480
we might say that the practice is really just a commitment to look deeply

166
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,920
into whatever is arising and i appreciate very much matthew brent

167
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,640
silver sometime last year he gave this talk about this idea and

168
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,960
he highlighted that when we first begin the question or when we're beginning practice

169
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:31,599
we could say the question is what is it like to be human

170
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,920
what is it actually like not what do we think it should be or how we

171
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,440
imagine it by might be or how we have been told it should be but what is

172
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,960
it what is the truth of this human's experience

173
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:57,760
and in this way practice is to like stop fooling ourselves or wishing that things were different but to really see

174
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:04,800
that truth truthfully about our own minds and we can ask ourselves are we really

175
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,240
seeing ourselves truthfully

176
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:17,920
instead of trying to go find the truth out there are we really seeing ourselves clearly

177
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,440
and this is what practice is about

178
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,920
so when we look in this way we might discover

179
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:36,319
perhaps to our that we're doing a lot of rationalizing

180
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:42,078
rationalizing our habits rationalizing our preferences

181
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:50,240
maybe this is one of the humbling aspects of practice is to see how much of our lives our rationalizations of our

182
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:56,400
conditions and our preferences was it until matthew kind of highlighted

183
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,839
this i that i really saw it but i think i have to agree

184
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:07,200
of course through our conditioning we have certain ways in which we

185
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:15,200
like to be seen or experiences we like to have we have preferences

186
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,440
and often we're just kind of maybe not like noticing some of those maybe

187
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,119
unflattering things that we might see in ourselves instead we might rationalize oh yeah but

188
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,560
i'm just that way because we have some we have a reason of course

189
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:39,119
we have a reason but there might be a way in which we

190
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:46,160
don't really see all that's going on in our minds maybe we have this idea that we're like scientists

191
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,599
and that scientists have a hypothesis like i wonder what's in the mind and

192
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,920
then they conduct experiments to see and they conduct these experiments not

193
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,200
necessarily knowing what they're going to find they

194
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,240
set up something like a clinical trial or something like this right

195
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:14,000
and then when the experiment is finished they look to see what the results are

196
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:21,200
so many of us might think that we're doing this with our own minds our own experience

197
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:28,400
but i kind of chuckled when i heard matthew say they said that what happens is that many of us instead

198
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,560
of being scientists or more like lawyers in the sense that lawyers have a

199
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,079
conclusion that they need to have and then they find the data to support

200
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,920
it so we all have as conclusions about ourselves

201
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,400
this ideas that we think about ourselves i'm a good person i'm a bad person i'm a

202
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,960
kind person i'm not so kind i'm generous i'm selfish

203
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,880
whatever these ideas that we have they're all about kind of like this self

204
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:11,200
and our ideas about ourselves and so often of course when we look in

205
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,640
our minds when we look in our experience we are

206
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,680
seeing data that supports the way that we think

207
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:30,800
about ourselves whether that way we think about it is flattering or unflattering

208
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:39,440
so we're not maybe seeing the truth of our selves

209
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:46,000
the entirety of ourselves perhaps and maybe we would say

210
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:54,960
specifically we often don't see our the expression of some of these unwholesome roots or defilements

211
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,800
not so keen on this word defilements it sounds uh pejorative and and to be sure

212
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:08,800
that unwholesome roots are not fantastic i should say but it is part of

213
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,400
what it means to be human is to have these

214
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,720
these unwholesome roots these unskillful roots and the buddha recognized this

215
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:26,480
and he gave this simile of the cloth as one way to describe it and it goes

216
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:34,720
like this suppose a cloth were defiled and stained

217
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:41,200
and a dyer someone who was with some that would die things

218
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:47,680
and a dyer dipped it in some dye or other whether blue or yellow or red or

219
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,760
carmine it would look poorly dyed and impure in color

220
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,680
why is that because of the impurity of the cloth

221
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,200
so too when the mind is defiled soiled we might say

222
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:11,280
an unhappy outcome might be expected so the buddha is pointing out that as

223
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:18,240
long as we have these in our minds then you know the outcome is not going to be

224
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:24,960
as if it weren't there of course and so to maybe um

225
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:31,119
speak a little bit more specifically the buddha gives this long list of these

226
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:38,079
unwholesome roots or you can say imperfections that stain the mind

227
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,760
and i've looked at a number of different translators looking at this long list

228
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:50,720
and it's fun to see how different they all are on some of these words because they're not so common and

229
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:57,440
maybe we don't quite know how to translate them into english so to hold these loosely but to give you

230
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,240
a sense of what's being pointed out here

231
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:08,079
so this list of 16 we could maybe say calaises

232
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:14,800
defilements and wholesome states unbalanced greed

233
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,319
anger resentment contempt spite

234
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:25,839
envy meanness deceit treachery

235
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:31,839
stubbornness rivalry conceit arrogance

236
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:37,920
vanity longing and carelessness

237
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,880
sometimes if we were to see something like this in our minds this can be this

238
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,560
dance between revelation and denial oh i see oh i see i have this quality no i

239
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:56,720
don't or you know it can be a sense of a flash

240
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:04,800
or a flicker i see this although i don't see it maybe i do have this maybe i don't

241
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:11,520
it can also be the opposite right where we can see that we have some of these states and then we just

242
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:17,040
grab on to it and take on a new identity i'm the one

243
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:22,079
who is filled with envy i'm the one who has

244
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,079
rivalry whatever it might be

245
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:35,440
so many of you know that we can simplify this list to three

246
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:44,160
greed hatred and delusion peace unhols the roots of all other of

247
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:49,280
the defilements and

248
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,960
maybe we can say that delusion is a way in which kind of

249
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:02,000
helps us not see our greed and our hatred and all the different forms that it takes

250
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:11,200
so truth like this practice of working with truth can be an antidote to

251
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,640
self-delusion there's a way in which we can really

252
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:22,079
understand ourselves better not so that we can beat ourselves up better

253
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:28,480
not so that we can finally find that data that proves that we're a bad person or something like

254
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:35,599
this just so that we can wash this cloth

255
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,599
that has some stains on it

256
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:46,880
and so i've one way that we could say that maybe we

257
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,920
could play with this analogy that there's some uh pre-treatments before we

258
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,040
do some of this washing like um i used there used to be this

259
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:02,160
product i'm not sure if it still exists called like spray and wash right you could like put it on the cloth before

260
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:07,920
you put the cloth into the into the laundry into the wash

261
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:14,960
so some things that might help with some pre-treatment of if we find some of these states in

262
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:22,559
our minds loving kindness practice because it takes a lot of warmth

263
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,680
care and compassion not to mention courage

264
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:33,599
but warmth care and compassion to do this work this mindfulness

265
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:41,119
and to really see how things are that sometimes we do have flickers of anger or flickers of

266
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:49,599
conceit it doesn't make us a bad person it makes us human

267
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,000
and part of this practice is just to help you know loosen up some of these

268
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,200
stains some of the ways in which the beauty of the heart and mind might have

269
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:07,520
a little bit of specks some soil on them so loving kindness practice

270
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:14,240
compassion practice any of the hard practices fabulous pre-treatment to help these

271
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:21,280
come out another one concentration practice

272
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:28,240
and i don't know how this works exactly but if the mind has an opportunity to

273
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,599
settle and we have an opportunity to feel some

274
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,839
well-being to feel some happiness to feel some

275
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:45,599
contentment even if it's just a little bit that's a way in which helps

276
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:51,520
these everything else to come out in the wash so to speak

277
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:59,680
so one way to work with these kalashas these defilements these

278
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:05,680
unwholesome roots is with loving-kindness practice concentration practice as well as

279
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:12,559
mindfulness practice and it can be helpful to work with just

280
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:17,839
one at a time instead of feeling like oh my gosh i see everything there that whole list

281
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:23,359
of 16 i've maybe at times have seen it or maybe not too right

282
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:29,599
but maybe just to choose one i'm gonna notice rivalry

283
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:35,440
just when does that show up for me is it a habit of mind

284
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:44,800
maybe it says something that i learned long ago and is no longer helpful just doesn't make sense anymore

285
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:51,520
so maybe to just choose one if you notice it and just notice how it shows up in your daily

286
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:57,680
life it shows up in meditation with

287
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:04,559
a warm heart right this is so key this is so key

288
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:10,400
right this practice is not about beating ourselves up it's not about

289
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:16,559
making ourselves feel bad but freedom

290
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:22,400
getting this cloth clean is freedom complete freedom

291
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:29,200
and it is possible so we can just work with these a little

292
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,160
bit as we see them in a warm-hearted way

293
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:42,160
in the same way that we're looking at some of these defilements we might we should and can

294
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:48,800
also ask are we acknowledging what is wholesome we also acknowledging what is wholesome

295
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:54,640
right the practice is to be what is it like to be a human

296
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:01,359
humans have wholesome qualities too so sometimes we might just

297
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:06,960
not be seeing the unwholesome sometimes we might not be seeing the wholesome

298
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:13,119
so just to acknowledge that there's both sides and the practice is to see maybe the breadth

299
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,480
of our experiences

300
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:25,280
and to keep compassion as a companion in this investigation

301
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:32,000
and i'd like to share this poem by rosemary trauma i appreciate rosemary trauma very much

302
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,838
her poetry his touching is beautiful

303
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:45,040
in a way that i and i appreciate maybe not for everybody but this is a poem that she wrote on january

304
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:53,440
24th 2021 less than a year ago and it's called choosing truth

305
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:59,040
and it goes like this and

306
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:04,640
if i find i'd rather not meet the truth

307
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:10,880
then i can notice the little girl in me the one who hides in the closet when she

308
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:18,480
is afraid the one who plays dead the one who ends all her stories with

309
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:25,839
happily ever after and i can choose to love her

310
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:35,200
i don't need to drag her out or force her to look or to tell her that sometimes the villain wins in the end

311
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:43,200
instead i can remind the rest of me how alive i feel

312
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:50,400
when i meet it all when i choose to enter the day eyes open

313
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:56,559
ears open hands open and let the world in

314
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:03,760
that is how on this day when i know the truth of how cruel

315
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:11,359
we humans can be i can lean into that pain

316
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:16,880
at the same time i watch the sky turn pink

317
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:23,920
behind the white aspen and feel the cold air kiss my cheeks

318
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:30,559
my breath rising in visible prayer meeting difficult truths

319
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,319
i walk right through

320
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:44,160
this is practice i think this is a beautiful way to describe practice

321
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:52,400
you discover things that are uncomfortable difficult about ourselves about others about life

322
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:59,920
and we don't beat ourselves up i appreciate very much that rosemary

323
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:06,640
trauma writes instead i can remind the rest of me how alive i

324
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:12,799
feel when i meet it all there's a way in which if we're not

325
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:18,960
telling the truth or seeing the truth or holding the truth intentionally there's a way in which

326
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:25,680
there's a secret somewhere that we're trying to keep away from others keep away from

327
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:31,200
ourselves and when we hold secrets there's a

328
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:36,240
little bit of a dead name maybe something that we're trying to

329
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:43,359
lose contact with but rosemary right rosemary trauma

330
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:49,920
writes i don't need to drag her out or force her to look or tell her that sometimes the villain wins

331
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,520
in the end instead i can remind the rest of me how

332
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:01,280
alive i feel when i meet it all when i choose to enter the day

333
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,480
eyes open ears open hands open

334
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,680
and let the world in

335
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:23,440
if i find i'd rather not meet the truth then i can notice the little girl in me

336
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:30,319
the one who hides in the closet when she is afraid the one who plays dead the one who ends

337
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:39,000
all her stories with happily ever after and i can choose to love her

338
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:47,000
so truth as an antidote to self-delusion

339
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:55,920
maybe love is another antidote to self-delusion

340
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:01,119
maybe if we have love and compassion it's a way in which there can be an opening

341
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:09,640
to see that which might be difficult to see to hold what might be difficult to hold

342
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:17,359
so we might have all these different ideas about truth and we might have this idea that we want to see or find

343
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:23,839
the truth with a capital t and this belief that we're going to find it somewhere and it's going to make us

344
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:32,319
happy we may not know what truth with a capital t is

345
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:39,280
but we do know what honesty is and that's what this practice is asking

346
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:46,480
of us to be with our experience

347
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,839
to see the truth of our experience and to be as honest as we can

348
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:57,599
bathed in care bathed in love bathed in compassion

349
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:04,160
bathed in warmth to increase the capacity to see

350
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:10,559
everything and use a little pre-treatment on any cloth that has a stain that needs to be

351
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:16,079
cleaned so in this way we can show up for our

352
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:22,160
lives we can show up for others we can show up in this world that is

353
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:28,000
benefit and support for all beings

354
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
everywhere thank you
