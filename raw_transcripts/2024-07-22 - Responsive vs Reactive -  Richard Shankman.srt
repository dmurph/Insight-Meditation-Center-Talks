00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:06,160
good morning Richard Shanklin and welcome back to IMC thank you good

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:14,200
morning so we're good to go no announcements good to okay all right so good morning everyone

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,720
I'm happy to be with you let me just say what I have in mind

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:26,080
um I I just I have a little bit in the beginning I actually want to try to keep it quite short just to kind of get us

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,160
started and then I hope mostly to open it up for disc discuss if there's questions and that can often be a good

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,120
discussion if if there isn't much I'm prepared to you know talk more if I need

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,840
those of you who know me I I can talk so so but that's kind of most what I'd

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,559
like to do um the ending time um is scheduled for 10:45 we want to respect

9
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,079
the time um I was told that if things are going and we want to keep going five

10
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:03,000
or 10 minutes after that's okay but we want to also for some of you need to leave so at 10:45 if you need to leave

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,799
just take care of yourself go and don't matter of fact at any time you're not stuck here just take

12
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,920
care of yourself you'll stay when you need to stay go when you need to go it's all good so uh that's kind of what we'll

13
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:21,119
do yeah so you know I was reflecting coming here because I used to I live in

14
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,280
Oakland and um way back I used to come here you know a fair amount but I haven't been here much really for number

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,880
of years just don't get here at all so I was wondering there's a few people here I recognize from way back but I was

16
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,360
wondering am I going to know anyone as I look around really I don't I don't know

17
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,799
really anyone here there's a few people but there's no one here I know well so I was reflecting so what would be of you

18
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,600
value or interest to talk about given that I don't know the group I don't know you I don't know your

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:59,600
goals right what you're as a Dharma practitioner or meditator and you know we don't all same

20
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,880
obious viously share the same goals and I don't make assumptions it's certainly not for anyone else to tell us what our

21
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:13,760
goals should be we need to come to that oursel I hope we'll reflect on Dharma teachings as we kind of get clearer

22
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:21,400
about our goals but then we're each going to find our own way you know in the tradition there's this idea of um

23
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,480
you know Nirvana that's the Sanskrit or neana and ply and some we that's a whole

24
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,400
discussion and uh we don't know if we'll get into that today but some of you may think like that I'm guessing most of us

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,360
probably don't uh you'll hear words like um

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,159
Enlightenment realization Awakening Liberation all these different terms they all have different connotations for

27
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:53,800
each of us um they're not all the same thing but uh that's a whole another discussion

28
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,599
um so but I feel pretty sure that probably

29
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:06,239
there's a few things we all most of us probably do share in common you know you may not have a sense of of your goals

30
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,319
sometimes we're drawn to these practices and it's just it's not clearly articulated maybe we're just we think

31
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,879
there's something there of value I when I started out I was 18 years old and you know I

32
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,519
was drawn to these and I just thought you know I didn't know but those people

33
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:29,920
who are doing that meditation and going whatever real deep is there's something they got

34
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,840
I want that and there was just a sense of something like that and um but I

35
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,360
hadn't some of us may have a sense of uh just wanting to live in a way that's uh what we suffer less probably that's true

36
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,720
for all of us right want to suffer less or live in a way that's um I don't know you have to F in your own words

37
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,000
um I bet all of us want to live in a way where where we have a Kinder heart more

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,680
empathetic less ill will anger hatred right probably all of us um I bet

39
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,439
probably most all of us want to live if you think about it would who wouldn't want to live in a way where we're more

40
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:14,400
clear non-reactive and um uh what would you say more wisely responsive as

41
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,759
opposed to being reactive and life maybe something like that

42
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:26,000
um present awake wise you know there's lots of different terms you have to find

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,479
your own adjectives one way

44
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:38,479
I bet all of us want to live in a way that creates less and less suffering for ourselves and for others

45
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,520
and wants to create more you could say happiness or well-being for others than ourselves that's a simple I actually I

46
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,960
like that right and um who wouldn't want to do that so anyway you have to find

47
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,120
your own way um but assuming we're up for something whatever our goal or aims

48
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,360
are then the question is what's going to support us to to be able to actualize

49
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,720
that so it starts with a nice idea and then maybe it becomes actually more

50
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,520
alive and when many of you will know for your own practices that you've seen lots of fruits and benefits in your practice

51
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:23,680
I was just speaking with someone a couple of days ago he's been a Dharma person for maybe five years and uh when he came

52
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,880
to our our group is up in Oakland we're called the metad Dharma Foundation we're kind of like you guys here we're smaller but uh you have our weekly group we run

53
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,720
Retreats and all that kind of stuff and um he came and good person everything

54
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,720
and he said himself that he had a lot of anger and a lot you know I'm just saying what you know kind of things he was

55
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,160
sharing about himself and just even in this five years you know so much has transformed and he was sharing yesterday

56
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:57,160
or two days ago with me that he had someone working where he lived and they uh accidentally destroyed a plant that

57
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,240
was like his favorite plant there was a big deal about the plant and

58
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,680
he was saying how it used this may not sound like that much but he he said it used to feel like that would be

59
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:15,080
something he would have just it would not have gone over well with the person who accidentally did it

60
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:22,680
and he said this time he noticed that he just kind of walked away and and um and just

61
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:30,479
thought well you know things happen and he noticed wow what a shift in himself and he said to me

62
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:37,240
um things are better when you're a Buddhist uh you may not identify as a

63
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,400
Buddhist uh that's a whole another thing maybe I'm suppos not supposed to talk like that around

64
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,560
here uh since it's a Buddhist place I've I've been a Buddhist

65
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:54,639
uh Allin for many many decades I've been meditating like I don't know 55 years 54

66
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,520
years uh I don't identify at all as a Buddhist anymore just totally dropped away

67
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
where's Buddhism just in the aliveness of the present moment right but I don't really tell people that all wait we're

68
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,840
broadcast we're we're live casting right oh man so anyway I shouldn't said that but

69
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,919
um you know I'm not using notes so it kind of can go like this in a talk but

70
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,599
you know the Buddhist Buddha wasn't a Buddhist that let's not don't I don't want to make a big deal of it and don't tell people up at metad Dharma I said

71
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:34,680
I'm not a Buddhist I don't want them to freak out um but anyway but I am a Buddhist but

72
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:42,199
anyway um so we see that's real fruit you know it's not like this Nirvana or something

73
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,560
he can actually look and see a shift and I bet many of you can some of you may be

74
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,159
waiting when am I going to get what this thing that's supposed to start happening waiting for something to happen and it

75
00:07:53,159 --> 00:08:00,520
can be like that I can relate to that so you have lots of company if you feel that way so don't worry about

76
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,720
it you just show up the best you can whatever that looks like it doesn't

77
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:13,639
matter don't you will see if you don't come talk to me if you if you don't know this

78
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:21,080
sometimes it can take a lifetime but it actually profoundly transforms people's experience of being it's a real thing

79
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:27,400
right lots of people experience stuff like that so fruits come but we don't have to wait just look back in your own

80
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:33,680
life is there anything you can see that used to be

81
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,320
challenging difficult that's even one thing that's a little better now that's

82
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,839
a shift don't invalidate that so anyway

83
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:51,040
but I'm happy to chat with you or hopefully there's people here you can chat with around that if you're can't find what's working or

84
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,360
can't find your own goodness or anything like that because it's not hard to find

85
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,279
sometimes we need to help pointing it out so what's going to help us actualize

86
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:10,160
these beautiful qualities of our hearts and Minds more and it's not one way the you know

87
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,079
here there's I have again I'm not around here as much as I used to be so I I

88
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:22,120
don't really know exact I know a lot of the teachers from way back maybe things have shifted but I have a general sense

89
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,000
of how things are taught here you can see for yourself you're here so obviously it's it's a powerful path and

90
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,240
will work well for you you might practice in other ways but in some way I think um probably most of these

91
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:43,120
practices bring together a few main qualities in our tradition that can really help us one of them is learning

92
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,000
to steady the mind more sometimes I use this word concentration it's a terrible

93
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,360
translation for the word somati we're stuck with the word concentration because everybody uses it

94
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,399
but it's just it's it's okay but it has so many connotations so we just need to be clear what we're

95
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:06,880
talking about when I say that it's okay steadying however much just so we're not

96
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,800
a little bit even steuding the Mind mindfulness we talk about Insight we talk about qualities of the heart how

97
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:21,920
you develop these and in what combination in what ways um that's highly individual for all of us it turns

98
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,399
out what I'm about to say here is you know I'm not trying to be controversial

99
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:35,040
but uh if I say something and it's different than what someone else is say it's okay just it's not a big deal just

100
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,160
find what works for you but uh because what I'm going to say here is okay here it

101
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,399
comes it doesn't matter what you

102
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,720
do I mean you want to do something that's not creating suffering and but

103
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,880
within the Dharma world and the practitioner it does not

104
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:02,519
matter pick up on whichever thread Within teachings and practices calls to

105
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,600
you we can get more specific when we have questions if you want but um follow

106
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:15,959
that listen to your calling not someone else's way they're

107
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:22,160
different than you they have to find their calling if you don't know what it is you just pick something and stick

108
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,160
with it a little bit and it'll either say wow I I feel connected with this it's resonating for me I'm feeling

109
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,120
results or you know it doesn't feel like but huh I picked up this book over here and wow that's interesting there was

110
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,200
somebody who um um actually just this week who I was

111
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,680
her first Dharma teacher she's been in it for about a couple of years and uh we have a great relationship everything's

112
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:54,839
good and um she's just recently gotten drawn over into Japanese renai

113
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,200
Zen which I know a little bit I used to there's a rinai C called Zen Mountain

114
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:07,440
Monastery up in Upstate New York and the Abbot liked my first book so they used to bring me there I didn't know anything about rinai Zen but I would aw me to

115
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:15,560
come and teach and it was nice to go there it's just a different thing and so we had a discussion um um

116
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,120
and she felt all guilty because she's going working with a new

117
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,600
teacher and coming in a New Direction and everything and that was nice of her to you know want to care and but it's

118
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,199
not like that if renai Zen's becoming alive for her

119
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:40,160
and she did not follow that then I'd be worried right but she thought oh she she

120
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,720
didn't want to feel like she's not with me it's like no it's not like that it's about each of us so I appreciated her

121
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:53,600
and again caring right so that's what what or it may not even be in the Buddhist world I don't know it may be

122
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:02,519
your anyway you get the idea right because and this is the last thing I'll say and then I how you do this is the

123
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:09,160
details I'm just trying to kind of give you my sense that um I mean it very

124
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:16,959
seriously I have come to feel like so used one more thing I'll back up for a second so I've always been identified as

125
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:23,360
a somati or Jan teacher uh that's become more uh around

126
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,639
more but back in the early days way back it was like me and one other guy Lee braisington and that was it and it was

127
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:35,639
like oh man you guys aren't Insight teachers and it was a whole big thing right back then and of course it's not

128
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:41,440
true we've learned and anybody who Who develops samati knows that the Insight

129
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,360
the mindfulness the concentration the heart it's all there but if you're not doing somati or Janna and you're just

130
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:56,320
doing pure mindfulness the concentration the mindfulness the Insight the heart it's all there whichever doorway or you

131
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,160
pick it they all parts have elements are there and come in in the right way for

132
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,880
you right so it's kind of like that so so we have to find our way so it used to

133
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,519
be even up into the really only even the last seven or eight years as I've really

134
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,880
come to appreciate that even talking about Janna that word won't mean much to you but it's these deep meditative

135
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:26,319
States that's too restrictive because it's kind of defined in a certain way it's still

136
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:32,720
good the real path this is the part that I have to say again it may be different

137
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:41,839
than what you've heard but it's all right I really see that the path as we

138
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,600
we we train ourselves to be able to connect more deeply and authentically within

139
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,360
ourselves and then we learn two things to actually experientially what does

140
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,920
that mean to be connected with in ourselves because that's hard for some of us and easier for others it's just different for each person

141
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:07,320
and then to listen to that and let it start to lead the way so that um and we

142
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:14,120
learn to distinguish between like our likes and dislikes and our greed hatred and delusion and our authentic voice

143
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:20,040
because they can mask right we think we're following ourselves and really it's just your opinion or whatever right

144
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:27,360
so we we learn to really recognize something that's authentic our own Spiritual Awakening and path and then it

145
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:34,440
starts to open and then the the whole path is we know how to follow and then it knows how to lead us and open and

146
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,959
find show the way and there's no limit on what that might look

147
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:48,199
like it's a vast vast word and it transcends Traditions

148
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,079
methods systems we use all of those systems that's important we're in a

149
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,560
tradition we practice we have teachings they're important you know there's all

150
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:05,440
the Buddhist lists we use these things techniques people are doing the same

151
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:12,759
thing from other Traditions too but once you connect in and the aliveness reveals itself that's the whole path there and

152
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:19,639
and then it can open up I can say more about it's just amazing some of the ways that can reveal ourselves and we really

153
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:26,360
come to some to it's really I mean it sounds kind of like happy Feelgood talk but really I

154
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,480
think it's it's finding the pathway uh deep into

155
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,360
ourselves yeah and sometimes we can find places of

156
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:44,680
amazing beauty that we just had no idea was there or Liberation or Enlightenment or all kinds of things that we that that

157
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:52,800
that was there but we were just had lost the connection and it can be kind of like that anyway so um I'm going to stop

158
00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:01,040
there and um again if if that was to I don't even just forget it and and uh we we can

159
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,880
just open it up if anybody has a comment uh about anything I said anything else

160
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,319
question yeah bill please go uh hi Richard um

161
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:19,360
hey um like maybe everyone here when it comes to my practice I've got my

162
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,880
strengths and I've got my weaknesses right uh and uh I'm I'm extremely

163
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,280
grateful for my strengths they've made all the difference in my life I'm comparably happier than I used to be and

164
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,480
I feel like my strengths are are real strengths I'm happy for them um my

165
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,640
weaknesses are uh discipline and if you

166
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,960
will concentration um my you know my my daily

167
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,160
practice is not really there as far as formal sitting practice is concerned

168
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,200
even though I think I ought to be doing it I'm sure I'm sure I should and the concentration

169
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,600
when I'm sitting my uh ability to follow the breath is is poor I me I can go off

170
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,760
on a 10-minute Daydream without barely even being aware that I'm doing it um

171
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:17,919
it's it's hard for me to follow the breath I'm just just not natural for me um so um when you say it doesn't matter

172
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,760
what you do uh correct in a way um that makes me

173
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:30,080
feel good cuz you know go with my strengths right but but I'm wondering can you say something since you're the

174
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:37,799
samat guy um if I was able to develop the

175
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:45,559
concentration practice skills and and and do them dedicatedly regularly uh

176
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:52,039
what kind of difference do you think that makes I think it will transform your whole life say more it will

177
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:59,919
transform your life and

178
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,200
that's everybody I know and I think it's just because of my books maybe I tracked

179
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,120
people here you know um over the years I still do uh you know from all over every

180
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,320
person without exception I've ever met who's a who's appreciated the power of

181
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:23,440
samati a lot of them come what we call Pure Insight tradition everything everyone sees the Power and the benefit

182
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,760
of it and that it supercharges everything else the mindfulness the

183
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,360
Insight the heart qualities having said that so and you're smiling but I just

184
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:42,600
want to say so that's all real but there's no like got to get

185
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,240
anything because let's just imagine someone didn't have any concentration at

186
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,799
all never did it you sat down to just be present with yourself actually when you've got

187
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:02,240
concentration it's easy to sit with yourself that's easy cuz you've got the power and the support of the samade to

188
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:10,120
meet all the challenges and the ups and downs and everything it's a heroic journey to sit and be present

189
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:16,520
with yourself without concentration when your body's hurting your mind's out of control you're either so Restless you're

190
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:22,600
going to jump out of your skin or the opposite you're falling asleep and everything and to be with all of

191
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:29,080
that that's the heroic practice right there for real and everybody who's done

192
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:36,720
that knows that I've been through that a lot myself and so everybody has if you could just do and sit to be

193
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,080
with yourself and just in the FI it's not always like a fire but just in that

194
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:49,039
with your suffering with the ups and the downs and be with everything learning to just that would there's a purification

195
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:55,799
and a letting go and a non clinging that would come just to learn to let go just by doing nothing we don't talk

196
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:02,480
about Som we don't talk about anything just a can I just be present and for all the times I can't be present how do I be

197
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,919
with that and everything so that's an example when I say it doesn't matter what you do I don't mean in life it doesn't matter what you do I mean I

198
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:15,480
guess you could say that but I hope we all would want to I'm talking about when we're doing different practices within

199
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,720
like the Dharma and everything you're everyone's going to show up with their a combination of

200
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,919
their strengths and their weaknesses if you want to call it that I don't I use different language because weakness but

201
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:34,080
just the way we work along with whatever Our intention is how we want to consciously aim our

202
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,760
practice and then a whole big piece and

203
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,799
is we have some intentions but then we practice in a certain way that's aiming

204
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:52,760
us but the whole trick of the whole thing is we let the present moment teach

205
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:59,279
us and inform us that's the whole thing how you do that as a learning that

206
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:04,360
comes in a skill over time because a lot of times we're just caught and we were reactive but if we with time everyone

207
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,320
can learn we we come to see like just what's going on in the present moment and

208
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:17,080
during the times when every the body's cooperating the mind's clear we're steady we can practice in ways and just

209
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:23,159
develop the concentration side and it doesn't matter because on its own there's going to be times when you can't

210
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:28,880
concentrate mind's not cooperating emotional stuff's coming up and everything

211
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:35,799
and people say oh I had a bad meditation there's literally not such a thing as a bad meditation absolutely not

212
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:41,919
there's just what is happening in the present moment and how do we work with it and if we can hold that attitude we

213
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,880
do and we do the best we can because a lot of times we don't even

214
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,039
see the way we're caught we're reactive we can't so we do the best we can

215
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:59,120
meeting the present moment with as much clarity as we have you don't have to be better at it than you are you just don't

216
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:06,720
cuz if we had to be better at it than we are well you're screwed I'm thinking my son is he's in

217
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,480
high school he's a a jazz trombone player he's a pretty good player for high school player he can he can play

218
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:19,720
and he sounds great and uh he's pretty good and he's on this you know Jazz Ensemble and everything so sometimes

219
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:28,600
I'll get his trombone and try to play and I remember when he started playing was in the third grade when he started couldn't do anything no skill no ability

220
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,679
nothing that's how it is for me I try to play if you any of you play a brass instrument uh it's hard you have to

221
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:40,400
develop your Essure it's it's tough but you with you don't have to have any

222
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:47,039
skill you don't even have to know how to get skill you just show up with I mean you

223
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:52,320
get a teacher you start to blow and you just do your best to try to get it and starting from

224
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,880
nothing you can get like really good it's like that with our Dharma practice

225
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:04,880
with life with meditation we bring the best we have you don't again I'm not

226
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:11,480
just I mean I am trying to make you feel good but it's not just trying to make you feel good it's literally

227
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:17,760
true that you start with what you have you try to remember the best you

228
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,400
can to let the present moment be your teacher you're going to forget that you you know right a million

229
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:29,159
times you're going to be pissed off at the present moment and you're going to remember this talk you're going you know

230
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:36,480
damn that shankman and you know because you're going to be suffering welcome to the

231
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:43,799
club we're all sufferers there will be times when you can remember and you'll do the best you

232
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:49,559
can to let go around your suffering and over time it gets

233
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:58,720
better I consider myself to be of average natural ability as a meditator

234
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:06,360
but um but I put in the time most people by the way most people

235
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:14,480
in this room don't have much of a daily meditation practice I've just learned over time it's just how it is it's

236
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,279
hard I used to teach I started I used to do a lot of prison Dharma work I don't anym this is but I started a couple of I

237
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,799
was a prison chaplain volunteered at a couple of California state prisons I started a bunch of dharm they're still

238
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:32,600
going and uh I remember um one was Selena's Valley

239
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:38,640
State Prison that's a tough level four Prison it's like Pelican Bay kind of a thing we'd run our group going every

240
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:45,360
week and then sometimes there'd be a violent incident they would have a lock down and until they sorted out for a few

241
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,279
days a week a month or something you know and so once they had this lock down everybody's in their cells they bring

242
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,320
them they feed you in your cell you just don't get out I think once or twice a week individually you get to come out

243
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,559
and go shower or something that's it we couldn't run the group and when when

244
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:07,520
we could when the lockdown was over it been I think a month or something a long time we came back we were going around

245
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,640
the group asking how are people doing some people were they managed okay

246
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:19,120
as you can imagine it was rough on some people and I said well how's your meditation going one

247
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:26,440
guy said I don't know I I just couldn't find the time to to

248
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:33,480
meditate I I've heard you say this before that's my that that's true that's

249
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:39,080
real that's my favorite story

250
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:45,080
because it's not your fault and I cannot tell you how many

251
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:51,399
people judge themselves in their Dharma practice by

252
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:56,440
how well their daily meditation practice is kept

253
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,480
up we won't do it but I guarantee you I've just been on the scene long enough

254
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,679
if we there's what 40 or 50 people here in this room if we went around

255
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,080
here a lot of people would have that feeling so you're not alone I've been

256
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:19,880
there myself even today like my somis and I'm

257
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,640
by the way I'm just going to say a little about my own practice it's no big thing many people so don't I'm not

258
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,720
making a big claim I've been doing a long time uh when I sit to meditate my concentration is

259
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,200
good it's great and I can have times I'm sitting

260
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:45,760
in this thing and I'm like way in it's really good and I'm restless and bored and I want to go check CNN if Biden did

261
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:53,080
whatever and and I'm sitting here Bliss out in meditation it can be like this we're

262
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,799
human beings we have all these forces we do the best we can

263
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:04,120
find the style of practice you like oh wait I've got to add one more

264
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,320
thing this is so important here's a question I think I already know the answer it's it's more

265
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:16,720
of a rhetorical question or you can answer if you want in your daily life as you just go

266
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,640
about your business a lot of times we can just be caught up in things we call it losing our mindfulness and we just sort

267
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,240
of sometimes people say the person went unconscious they're not unconscious we you know what they mean you're conscious

268
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:36,880
but you're just kind of it's like being on automatic pilot or something like that when you're not on autoptic and you

269
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,240
wake up if you will and you know what's happening in the present

270
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:48,159
moment and you notice say there's reactivity in the mind do you do your best to kind of let go of your re

271
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:54,880
activity best you can or do you go no I'm reactive I think I'll just go with it no you

272
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,039
don't when you wake up out of automatic pilot and you notice there's ill will do

273
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:06,120
you say yeah sometimes we do because the F the power can actually be strong

274
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,840
but or do you say you know I have an intention to live in a way this is actually one of my intentions to live in

275
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:18,640
a way where my heart never closes off ever I have plenty of work to do for

276
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,960
sure but um um I mean things get better but uh you know but that's that's that I aspire to

277
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,480
that when I wake up and realize oh there's reactivity in the

278
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:37,039
mind even if the energy of it is like no I'm going to tell that person or it's going to I have to go back to my

279
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:44,000
intention and realize wait a minute I don't feel like letting go of my ill will now I still have to do it because

280
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,519
that's my intention if I'm going to want to live with my heart doesn't close off don't you do the same thing or

281
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,960
whatever your intention is or do you just go no you know I'm pissed off and I know I am and I should have a kind heart

282
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,159
but screw it I'm just going to no you you do you use the time when you know

283
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:06,279
what's happening when you're not on onop pilot the best you can we all do what

284
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:13,399
more can you do that's full blast Arma practice so if you're judging your practice by just how well or poorly your

285
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:19,440
daily sitting is yeah get support sit more it's better if you can do it sure

286
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,480
but it's it's it's an in uh inaccurate way of judging

287
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:32,600
yourself actually judging yourself by how well or poorly you show up for anything is is is

288
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,720
um I would say maybe this is uh hubris for me to tell you what your criteria

289
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:46,200
should be but I'll just throw it out there um how well rep portly you show up or or

290
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,440
are or in any situation that that's not that's inaccurate way to judge yourself

291
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:58,159
how well you that's just reactive patterns of your mind that's what we're working on your intention is a much more

292
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,240
accurate um I would say uh

293
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,960
criteria how well you pull it off is that's just how well you've worked on your reactive patterns that's the

294
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,120
process that's the lifelong process we're all in but you're but your intention if

295
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,200
you've got a good intention to live in a way that creates less and less suffering for yourself and others and to create

296
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,639
more happiness and well-being for yourself and others when you lose that

297
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:33,039
and you're just not being such a great person in the moment you haven't your intention still

298
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:38,240
there you just lost contact with it it's all this happened it's still true for

299
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,200
you you just forgot and you get caught up in the energy of the moment your good

300
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:51,600
intention is still true for you and that says a lot about your good heart so that's I would say a better way to judge

301
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:59,840
than how well you meditate so if if um

302
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:08,360
if you're are able to maintain a good daily practice um with the benefits thereof

303
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:14,440
you're more likely to remember that good good intention and and to stay with

304
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,960
it it's like

305
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:26,559
anything my son's trombone playing is way better when he's more regularly

306
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,760
practicing and when he doesn't for those of you who play a brass instrument I don't but I've learned enough like you

307
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:39,080
lose your Ure there and you and it gets weaker and he loses his control doesn't have a sound he needs to get it back and

308
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:44,960
and then he's and then he's back in it so and then he's naturally flowing and when he's really flowing he tells me

309
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,960
he's not even thinking just musical feelings and I'm not a musician I don't know what this is like but just the

310
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,360
musical feeling and comes out and he's not even thinking where he's moving a slide it's just

311
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:03,480
flowing that's where can go so it's like that as Dharma practitioners and at some point you know as the Dharma becomes

312
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,559
more alive the lived experience of the living

313
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:14,080
flow of it is just becomes more and more like a set point for us yeah the other

314
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,399
thing I would just say I I picked up on this I don't this you may not be right for you but you said sometimes it's hard

315
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:25,679
to be with the breath now you've been a meditator I've known you from way back so I don't know your practice well but

316
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,360
it could be that breath medit is not the best practice for

317
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,799
you and if that's true then there's a question how do I find out if that's true I talk to me or maybe there's

318
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:46,200
others who could talk to you but that's a whole different thing because everyone can find their best practice and it's a big

319
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:54,200
world well when you have a moment I have an online online question oh yeah yeah go go yeah okay

320
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:02,399
um a Mystic writer uh visha Vargas a Mystic writer online

321
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,720
question if possible following what's alive in the practice can it be applied

322
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:15,480
to intentions and actions in our own lives if we have a talent we want to

323
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:22,158
develop that that doesn't sound like a question sounds like just a a sharing and a comment right yeah well I pre that

324
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,320
sounds wonder I like that that's great thank you for for the wisdom and that's another thing you know we also there's a

325
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:33,919
lot of Collective wisdom here obviously on the live stream or whatever I'm not sure and so thank you I really

326
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:38,200
appreciate that person for putting that wisdom into the

327
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:45,878
group just one quick thing before you just go here so I'm just watching the time here because I can see the clock

328
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:53,520
it's 10:35 and I'll say in about 10 minutes It'll be 10:45 just so those of you who need to go go and for those who

329
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,000
want to hang back if if it's still alive we can still go a few minutes so anyway so please go

330
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,800
yes um I've been thinking a lot about um my

331
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:12,440
name is Sylvie I've been thinking a lot about ethics lately and uh when you

332
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:18,480
started the discussion uh today you know you are trying to help us find words

333
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,880
that were coming that were alive for us on why we're practicing and and you came

334
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:30,800
up with this um definition that seems to be common denominator for all of us of

335
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,079
wanting to increase well-being um for ourselves and other and I want you to

336
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,920
continue let me say that was me saying that yeah I don't know that everybody would sign up for that I'm guessing most

337
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,880
people probably but yeah I was just yes so please go yes um so I sign up for

338
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:56,319
that um within that that context

339
00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:06,440
um I'm I I've been trying to connect this to you know what we call ethics in

340
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:13,480
the real world outside of Dharma Circle um because I was having this

341
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:20,480
conversation with someone who is not a practitioner

342
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,480
um and

343
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:33,680
when I came to meditation my motivation or anything I

344
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:41,960
heard about the practice was not ethics and somehow from meditating I've become

345
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:48,240
more sensitive to well-being and suffering and what causes it and and all

346
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,599
of those things and so I'm kind of getting closer to ethics I'm finding

347
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:01,160
myself but can ethics be realized without

348
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:07,640
mindfulness of course in how would you be able to have an

349
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:13,880
ethical life if you're not aware of the suffering you're causing yourself and

350
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:19,440
others well I don't know I mean that's a big question um you know I don't know if

351
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,880
I know the answer to that but there were two things first of all without you said can a person just be ethical without

352
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:32,560
mindfulness it may be that plenty of people don't think about mindfulness maybe they're caught on automatic pilot

353
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:41,079
a lot but the natural response maybe no none of us are perfect but the natural response is one of empathy of kindness

354
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:47,560
of care it's just out of comes out of how they naturally are so I don't think you have to say someone has to have

355
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:55,880
mindfulness now if we don't have what we call mindfulness which is so to me you know mindfulness my

356
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:01,599
definition of mindfulness is many definitions out there mine is not being on automatic pilot there's the practices

357
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:07,000
of mindfulness but the mental state of mindfulness you actually know what's happening in a present moment instead of

358
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,520
being lost in it then sure if if if you don't have that and we're caught up you

359
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:19,480
could say that we don't have freedom or choice in those moments because we're just reacting out of the

360
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,560
habitual uh patterns uh uh mental uh um

361
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,359
tendencies in Our Minds when we get a stimulus and there's response so if we want to make changes we have to have

362
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:36,839
some awareness to to make changes sure so uh yeah I guess where I'm I'm should

363
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:42,560
you have to want to do it and then be aware of what's Happening

364
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,119
sure where this is coming from is there is a lot

365
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:54,880
of enormous amount of harm that is being caused in in the world by all of us

366
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:03,079
human beings um but at the level of consciousness of the

367
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:12,599
humanity there is a very low awareness of that harm right and it's

368
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:18,200
not like it seems that we make assumptions that you know those people

369
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:24,720
are unethical those people are ethical those are good not good but most of the

370
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:34,359
people I've spoken to I find that they naturally want

371
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:39,480
to do something that's ethical right um

372
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:46,280
but what's the what's the question or what's the problem question is is if you're completely

373
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:52,400
unaware like you're the intention you keep talking about the intention right I

374
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:59,480
I my intention is to do good but I'm living my life I'm not talking about

375
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:07,119
myself but you know so and so is living their life on autopilot yeah right but their intention

376
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:13,000
is to be good we don't need to think about them we just need to think about

377
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,880
ourselves right that's more of a I I don't mean to kind of shut down what you're saying but

378
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:25,720
it sounds you know and I I hope I'm not coming across that way uh but it sounds like you're sort of having more of a

379
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:31,720
um I I don't mean mean this in any negative but maybe like a theoretical discussion of how it might be for other

380
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:37,760
people if they don't have mindfulness or something I I I don't know if that's right but um so you can correct me you

381
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,800
know if if I'm not if I'm missing what you're saying but so to me when I hear that it's like well I mean I don't know

382
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,119
I don't know brain science I don't know a lot of psychology you know what motivates people how they'll be that's

383
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:56,000
kind of the bigger questions but we can each look into ourselves and here we are

384
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,560
how we got here why want to be mindful why we ended up as Dharma practitioners they could have gone many many different

385
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,839
ways it's a big big world and we can tend to ourselves so personally I and I

386
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:13,160
just don't know the answer for everybody else and and and I don't know if it's that

387
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:20,440
useful like what what are you going to do if if say I said I knew the answer and answer what can we do with that

388
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:28,160
information we're not going to go around telling everybody um hey you you better be mindful

389
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,640
well it's not it's not telling people you're going to be mindful but it's you

390
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:39,760
know I'm in in my life in my work and what I want

391
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:46,040
to accomplish with my life I'm seeking to reduce human suffering in certain

392
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:52,560
sectors of um and a lot of it

393
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,680
is creating a wellness um yeah but what's the question

394
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:05,400
I'm I'm still just I think I'm missing what you're I guess my question is

395
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,760
what can you give me maybe your definition my your definition or your

396
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:25,319
understanding of how you would explain the relationship between what we call mindfulness and

397
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:31,559
ethics and you know it is connected but how would you you mean as as practicing

398
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:36,800
and developing it or just the state of what however you Define mental ethics

399
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:44,000
just being acting and living and manifesting that as opposed to cultivating it as I'm just not I'm

400
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,319
having yes manifesting I try U because I I think there's a way to connect what the both

401
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:56,920
of you are saying and I think when you're talking about Good Intentions yes that person might have good intentions

402
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:02,880
but it might be tainted by greed hatred and delusion so then it doesn't it's not

403
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,920
the purest but then what you were saying um was how does it relate to us and I

404
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:15,280
don't know about you and I hope it's okay for me to share what I've kind of been reflecting on but when we think

405
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:22,079
about the violence that's happening right and it's caused by hatred misunderstanding and all those things

406
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:27,720
sometimes I feel the same thing in my heart when somebody cuts me off or

407
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:33,599
interrupts me or you know things like that and so it's like how do we make

408
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:39,520
sense of it on a personal level it's like well we sometimes I see the same

409
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,640
tendencies in my own heart that's not you know wanting to like shoot someone

410
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:52,559
but it's like the same kind of aggression inside um and so you check yourself in those moments but I think

411
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:58,559
when we have like these ethical like discussions or debates a lot of people are just thinking about it in their

412
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:03,839
rational minds and but but the rational mind is subject to Greed hatred and

413
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:10,280
delusion I don't know if that makes sense at all yeah we're all so maybe we

414
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:17,200
can if we want to continue this maybe at the end I'm happy to chat more about it but um um all of

415
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:24,000
us um have plenty of greed hatred and delusion in our minds every one of us

416
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,480
everyone you're ever going to meet has it even if you get a guest teacher come

417
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:34,920
here and everybody's bowing down at their feet and I'm not being disrespectful they're human beings and

418
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,760
we're all doing the best we can a lot of people have a lot a lot of Purity I'm not being disrespectful people I respect

419
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:46,559
tremendously and when I've had conversations with many people whose names would be well

420
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:52,960
known they would be real about being a human being still being on this path it just gets subtler and subtler one of the

421
00:44:52,960 --> 00:45:00,000
ways I think about the path if any of you know like mathematics when you have a graph there a thing called an ASM toote and they'll graph something you

422
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,280
know maybe the the the graph will show a line coming down like this and maybe there's this xaxis and the line comes

423
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:11,839
down and then it approaches it curves down and the way they're graphing the graphic gets closer and closer and

424
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:18,040
closer and it goes out to infinity and as it goes further out it gets infinitely close it never really gets

425
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:25,480
there but just closer and closer and Clos and I wonder sometimes um if it's kind of like that that it just gets

426
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,559
better and better and closer and closer but so maybe work to be done or is there this because we've built up in the in

427
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:35,760
the in the various spiritual Traditions the Buddhists have done it too we've built up this

428
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:42,359
Perfection and don't want to be disrespectful maybe there is a Perfection out there uh nobody actually

429
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:50,640
knows um um nobody knows but we're all on the path to find

430
00:45:53,160 --> 00:46:01,119
out so we went a little over so I'm happy to so you're grabbing the mics so are we wrapping it up or actually I just

431
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,559
wanted to uh tell you Richard that I remember years ago you um you gave a

432
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:13,160
talk and you said that you had on your altar correct me if I'm wrong on your altar you had a picture of George W bush

433
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:19,480
and you tried to not Harden your heart and and I remember hearing that because

434
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:25,960
that was a fail okay by the way that reminds me so

435
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:31,440
I haven't had an altar for years I should P I don't I'm just don't do that anymore but I should pull actually make
