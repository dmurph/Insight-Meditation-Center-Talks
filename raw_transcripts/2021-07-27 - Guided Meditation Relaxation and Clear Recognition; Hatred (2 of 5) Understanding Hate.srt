1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,719
so hello and welcome

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:16,800
to this uh 30 minutes now of mindfulness meditation

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,000
and sometimes i think that there are two

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,640
mutually supportive aspects of mindfulness meditation

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:38,000
that they are and that they can work together

6
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,360
so the first is uh to relax

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,640
to release whatever tension that might be held in the mind or the body

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,760
or the heart and if there is no tension this

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,760
discerned then of course one should not keep relaxing some point relaxation

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,719
doesn't really become relevant

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,680
and and the relaxation is not the same thing as slumping or collapsing there is an

12
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,280
alertness and uprightness which is related to the second aspect

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,240
and that is the practice of clear recognition

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:35,600
the the uh to where there's a quality of attentiveness

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:44,000
that is a little bit more uh maybe acute then in everyday life

16
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,000
where there's a clarity to our experience of the present moment

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,200
that allows us to register or see or experience know

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,560
what is happening in the present moment in a particular way

19
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,799
and and different times it's more being aware more feeling more experiencing more

20
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:15,680
knowing more what some people will call a recognition and that special way is to

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:24,400
be aware without interfering with what we are aware of so

22
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,480
not to tighten up hold on not to have expectations not try to make something

23
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,360
happen not try to pull away or push away

24
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,879
but there's a quality of freedom in the clear recognition so this idea of

25
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,080
relaxing and kind of relaxing and opening the awareness up to really be

26
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,280
here with what's here part of this clear awareness can be

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:05,440
expressed that it's to allow whatever we know to be here so there's no

28
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:14,159
pushing or denying anything pushing away or denying and there's no holding on and clinging

29
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:21,280
to anything and there's a kind of deep respect to all things it's a deep kind of allowance

30
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,239
and one of the things that leads to is uh discovering that it's trustable

31
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:35,360
to allow the dharma to move through us to allow phenomena as they arise and pass to come

32
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:43,840
and go and evolve and change and process but the key to it is a clear recognition

33
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,959
where we kind of get out of the way we're not kind of you know we're not the

34
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:58,799
the agenda of the self doesn't come into play so this relaxing makes helps the

35
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,239
clear knowing be relaxed and useful

36
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:12,319
and the clear recognition helps us to stay alert and clear it also helps us to

37
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,919
recognize when what needs to be clearly recognized

38
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,680
is the tension we have because if it's not easy to relax then we shouldn't spend a

39
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,199
lot of time trying to do it but rather bring this loving careful attention

40
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,600
to what's going on here and then and sometimes what we learn to relax is

41
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,720
not the tensions in our body but we relax the tensions in the mind in

42
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,000
relationship to that so these two things to relax

43
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,199
and have clear recognition and discover how to be aware that gets out of the way and allows the

44
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:02,240
dharma to move through us so to take a upright posture or a

45
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:11,840
posture that allows you to be a little bit more alert

46
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,360
maybe there's a little energy in the posture for people who lie down on their back

47
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,759
sometimes that's uh found by um the

48
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,680
the forearm is uh the upper arm might be parallel to the

49
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,720
bed or the floor but the upper arms are pointing straight up towards the ceiling

50
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,960
one of them or both of them and that not only gives a little energy but also

51
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:48,880
gives the indication when we're starting to lose that um you know it falls over the arm

52
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,198
and gently closing the eyes

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,440
and perhaps using a few deep breaths to really relax the larger

54
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,280
tensions and holdings of the body

55
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,639
breathing in deeply and then a long exhale that really allows the shoulders and the

56
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,160
belly and to relax and let go

57
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,120
sometimes if there's a long exhale it's like progressive relaxation of the

58
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,680
shoulders just step by step it kind of like a little bit a little bit more

59
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:54,319
and then letting the breathing return to normal and still it's useful to relax to soften

60
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:03,840
softening in the face

61
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,759
softening relaxing the shoulders

62
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,039
maybe the area of the shoulder blades

63
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,199
maybe you can open up

64
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:38,479
your chest a bit and then see how you can relax your shoulders

65
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:59,840
and softening the belly

66
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,840
and then maybe relaxing softening the

67
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,800
mind imagining the mind is like the surface of a choppy

68
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,919
waters and the wind dies down and the surface of the lake the waters

69
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:41,839
spreads out wide and still and quiet

70
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,760
and then perhaps inside the mind somewhere inside

71
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:56,240
is the place from which you know or aware or you experience things

72
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,720
often the location for where we our sense of self might be

73
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,839
and as you exhale maybe soften relax

74
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:22,000
dissolve that center into the wide

75
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:37,839
field of the mind

76
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:50,480
and as you exhale at the end of the exhale

77
00:09:50,480 --> 00:10:00,560
soften relax a little bit into the paws between the exhale and

78
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:12,320
inhale the ever so slight momentary pause

79
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:20,880
so that you can allow for the inhale to arise on its own

80
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:28,000
out of that pause and you receive it

81
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,839
awareness receives

82
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:47,839
clear recognition receives the inhale

83
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,600
clear recognition allows the

84
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,839
exhale

85
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,399
and and continuing clear awareness of

86
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:26,079
breathing but if something else occurs in the body the mind the heart

87
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,959
that's more compelling than the breathing

88
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,920
see if there's some way you can relax about its presence

89
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:48,959
and practice clear awareness non-interfering attention

90
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,839
as if it has permission to be there no problem

91
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,480
and you practice clear awareness of it until you're ready to begin again on

92
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,839
your breathing

93
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:22,840
if you are floating away and thinking practice clear recognition of

94
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
thinking

95
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,360
and see if there's any tension involved or pressure

96
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,840
in thinking that can be relaxed

97
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,559
and perhaps renew your practice of clear recognition clear

98
00:19:50,559 --> 00:20:07,840
awareness of the present moment and begin again with your breathing

99
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,520
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

100
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:43,679
to imagine what relaxed clear recognition would be like

101
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:53,840
when gazing upon the joys and sorrows of the world

102
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:06,080
what would be like if you're able to stay relaxed clearly recognizing

103
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,400
the great bodhisattva of compassion the great embodiment of compassion

104
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:21,840
is sometimes named the one who sees the suffering of the world

105
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,640
and to see to gaze upon

106
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:35,520
the sorrows and joys of the world with relaxed clear recognition

107
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:42,960
and in so doing maybe the channels of recognition

108
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:52,158
can touch the tenderness and the warmth the places of care in our hearts

109
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:04,960
the place that where the heart is nourished nurtured by the goodness of the world

110
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:20,480
by our own goodness and from this place of being touched

111
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:34,799
to consider how wonderful it would be if the suffering of the world could be

112
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,840
transformed so that people are freed of that suffering

113
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,679
freed of oppression injustice

114
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,840
afraid of greed and hatred

115
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:10,880
and may it be so as we end the sitting wishing

116
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,200
may all beings be happy

117
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,080
may all beings be safe

118
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:30,240
may all beings be peaceful

119
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,360
may all beings be free

120
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:55,840
and may we learn to share this happiness safety peace and freedom with each other

121
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,179
[Music]

122
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:21,600
so today is the second talk on dosa which is uh

123
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,640
can be translated as hatred or hostility

124
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:34,640
and so we're following a sequence here of this week that yesterday i introduced

125
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:42,000
the concept of non-hatred as a significant state of uh well-being that

126
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,360
involves love and patience calmness peace

127
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:56,799
not just simply the absence of hatred but a reference point of uh of a significant healthy

128
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:04,320
state of being that highlights the the uh unsatisfactoriness of hatred

129
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:12,000
that highlights how it's um it's a form of stress and tension and and

130
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,720
pain for for the individual who has it when we can really see the contrast to

131
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,240
being in a state that's that's not hateful not full of hatred

132
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:31,519
and today i want to talk about just this idea of dosa itself and then i'll talk about

133
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:38,000
tomorrow i'll be practicing with it thursday will be um composting hatred

134
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,360
the transformation of it and friday will be the liberation from

135
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,840
hatred and what's possible with that liberation

136
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,840
so um the it's important to appreciate that

137
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,039
this word hatred uh dosa means hostility uh

138
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:04,559
it's ancient texts talk about it being a wanting to harm

139
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:11,840
and it can also involve intense dislike a kind of intense opposition to others

140
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:19,519
where that dislike and opposition is a form of harm making that others feel somehow belittled or

141
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,760
boxed in or oppressed or disrespected in some big way

142
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,559
when they dislike the the uh the aversion is so strong

143
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:38,720
and um now there can be kind of simple

144
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:46,640
dislike of things and people even in direct maybe dislike of their activities what they do

145
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,080
but it doesn't have to translate to any kind disrespect for others

146
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,880
it doesn't have to even diminish our love for others possible to have a kind of a heartfelt warmth

147
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:06,159
towards others even if we dislike some of the things that they do but the intensity of it um

148
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:12,320
even if we don't think we hate someone or feel hostility and the intensity of like we don't feel

149
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:21,039
like we want to harm them the intensity of the dislike is a form of hatred

150
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,760
and what it what it's not or what it overlaps with and sometimes

151
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,760
includes and sometimes doesn't is anger and this is important because if we

152
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:40,799
treat anger and this dosa hostility is the same thing then all anger is seen as being a problem or

153
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:47,600
being a source of suffering but if we see it as

154
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:55,440
sometimes anger is a very passioned sense of no sense of this is injust

155
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,760
this is not right and the intensity of it might look like something

156
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:07,600
that resembles hostility but there doesn't have to be any hostility in it i've been on the receiving end and of

157
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,280
what i call the white anger where i felt there was zero hostility

158
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,599
but uh and in fact i felt i don't know if i felt friendship from

159
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:27,200
the person but i felt no hostility i felt safe though the anger was intense and

160
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:34,398
the one occur the occurrence i'm thinking about it the intensity was in the message

161
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:42,320
of no don't do that again and as soon as the message was delivered

162
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,960
i could feel the person just kind of let it go and and it was an appropriate message

163
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,520
and uh it was received and i was inspired by the cle how clean it was that's

164
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:02,160
intensity of no so it was kind of an anger but there was no hostility as part of it

165
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:11,680
so this has the way in which we have hostility and our this movement of hatred can harm

166
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,359
is a way of we harm ourselves and that's why the reference point of

167
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:22,400
non-hatred is so useful because we see how we're harming ourselves

168
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:29,440
that it's like a a wood fire where the the

169
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:36,160
the wood is both uh uh the fire is arising out of the wood and

170
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:43,839
it's the fire is burning the wood so in the same way the heat of hatred burns the one who's

171
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:52,000
on fire with it harms it generally when there's hatred this dosa

172
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,280
the attention of the mind is externally directed is directed to the object of the

173
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,119
hostility and um and some people it takes a form of blame

174
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,680
sometimes sometimes takes the form of being hypercritical and unwillingness to

175
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:20,960
see anything good about the other person and only sees that aspect which is bad and or problematic um sometimes there's a

176
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,599
a recoiling from our own pain by blaming by finding something outside

177
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,640
of us to either blame or attack or to be hostile towards

178
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,160
sometimes as a deflection from being willing to experience our personal

179
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,000
pain and suffering and and somehow

180
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,160
redirecting that pain in a sense outward and sometimes it's clearly to cause

181
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,160
other people other people should feel pain i'm feeling pain so other people should feel pain

182
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,000
and so to recognize how hostility has this uh and also if there can be

183
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,240
hostility towards oneself uh maybe some people hate themselves or some aspect of themselves

184
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,320
and there also there's a kind it's not exactly externally focused but there's a kind of objectification of

185
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:21,119
something that the mind is directed towards and anytime there's this objectification

186
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,240
then there is an alienation both an alienation from the other person that we

187
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,680
might feel that towards or the other thing we feel that before we're no longer there present to be able

188
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,880
to see and feel experience fully what's there we're now seeing it through

189
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,359
a particular filter the filter of hate and hostility aversion and uh and every

190
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,880
and everything is seen in that light everything is wrong everything is and we

191
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:55,440
just pick up all the problems and um but also and so that's an alienation we don't really there fully

192
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:02,480
for the person it's also an alienation towards oneself that uh because we're involved in kind

193
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:11,200
of an intense objectification of something we're involved in a thought an idea a concept of something that um

194
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:18,800
the attention is kind of towards that object and towards thinking about it that we lose touch with ourselves

195
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:25,839
and so when there is uh intense hostility um then uh it does not be intense but

196
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:31,599
there's hostility it comes with all these different aspects it comes with a burning a

197
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:38,160
tension a tightening a stressful state to be in it comes with an objectification of

198
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,839
something that is alienating that disconnecting

199
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:49,119
and also see tomorrow the task of mindfulness is to re-establish the connection

200
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:56,960
overcome the alienation both towards others and towards oneself by opening up and really being present

201
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:05,520
part of because hostility and hatred is so compelling at times uh sometimes it's

202
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:14,160
um it produces its own um you know it produces its own fire

203
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:20,480
that hurts that that hurt of the stress or the alienation

204
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,839
produces more of the same and it kind of like it keeps looking

205
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:32,720
outwards for more things to hate or more things to feel bad about to be critical of and so there's a loop

206
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:40,320
that of hate sometimes where it's difficult sometimes to get out of because to do not

207
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,960
to not have the object of the hate or the is to allow us allow oneself to feel what's

208
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:54,160
happening here and that's just too difficult sometimes intense hatred comes from uh

209
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,079
maybe from good reasons within uh you know it could be that there's an intense protectiveness

210
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:08,079
maybe there's fear for good reason there are people who cause harm and um and so then it's easy to

211
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:15,119
uh justify the hatred because it's a form of protection from justifiable things we should you

212
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:22,160
know just viable reasons to be protected and and but the question is that really

213
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:29,040
the best way to protect ourselves and i can't i'm not going to answer that question for any individual

214
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,240
but because circumstances are so complex that i don't want to say that never have

215
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:42,240
hatred if that's what protects you from the harm that other people are doing but i believe that it's possible to be

216
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:50,480
trained or be reflective or be have a presence of mind that allows us to protect ourselves

217
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:58,560
in other ways besides using um returning hatred with hatred returning

218
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:05,040
harm with harm and but you know how to find that that's a

219
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,240
you know interesting that's an important topic but the beginning of it

220
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,240
is to have a willingness to study our own hatred to really uh our

221
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:23,200
hostility to really stop and take a look at it and if um and maybe the words hatred and

222
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:30,160
hostility are you know such such intense words that maybe you feel this doesn't relate

223
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:37,520
to you often but hostility and uh and hatred um are also very subtle forms of

224
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:45,520
aversion subtle forms of dislike and opposition to something um subtle subtle sometimes there's a

225
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:51,440
biting humor we use to kind of get back at people sometimes we say cutting things because

226
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,119
you know we're upset with someone we want to kind of step you know st have verbal daggers and stab them a little bit

227
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:05,119
there's all kinds of subtle and subtle ways in which we express um hostility or

228
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:11,920
say things which we don't believe we're wanting to harm anyone but there is a kind of subtle kind of

229
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:19,359
kind of attack that's happening so to become sensitive to this to become

230
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:28,839
aware of this and spend some time being willing to look at personal hostility

231
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:34,640
aversion that sometimes takes the form of prejudice and bias

232
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:41,680
sometimes takes the form of of turning away walking away shutting down

233
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,040
ignoring um where we feel like i'm not hostile but

234
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:53,359
we've kind of shut someone out of our hearts and and it is a kind of hostile act

235
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:00,160
and so but to study it to really get to know it and it's a worthwhile exercise to do and

236
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:07,440
even if it's just for these next 24 hours is to kind of review

237
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,480
how this dosa both mild and intense

238
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,400
has been part of your life and and how it's part of your life still and when it manifests and what are the

239
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,640
conditions to bring about and then what your relationship to it is do you

240
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,079
hate it do you are you distraught that you have this within you

241
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:35,359
do you justify it quickly right almost automatically how is it

242
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:42,640
and see if you can practice this clear recognition is to kind of relax with it and

243
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:50,079
and find a time and place where you can relax and just kind of allow it to be there so you can start seeing it clearly

244
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:57,200
without the interference of hating or hate being distraught over our hate being critical of our hate

245
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:03,200
turning away from it trying to fix it right away spend time getting to know it it's the

246
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:09,440
really getting to know and understanding how it is for us that lays the foundation for practicing with

247
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,560
it well and moving on towards freedom and because in buddhism

248
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:20,480
the freedom from great hatred and delusion is the definition is one of the primary definitions for

249
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,760
what full liberation is uh it's a well worth

250
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:33,040
to spend some time with each of these but this week with uh with hostility hatred uh dislike

251
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,560
and really kind of understanding how it works for you and hopefully you don't get discouraged or depressed

252
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:44,720
hopefully you feel in a certain way encouraged that this is the way forward this is a

253
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,960
wise and mature thing to do and then tomorrow we'll talk about practicing with it

254
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:58,480
so thank you and and may this all be for the purpose

255
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:05,838
of non-hatred thank you
