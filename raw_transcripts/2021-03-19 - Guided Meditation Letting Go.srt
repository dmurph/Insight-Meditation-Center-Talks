1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,160
and offer my warm greetings

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,600
and and

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,760
one of the things to appreciate as we do

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,120
buddhist meditation

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,719
to buddhist practice is liberation

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,560
itself and freedom

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,520
and liberation freedom takes many forms

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,039
some of them we don't associate with the

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,640
grand

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,359
words like liberation and and

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,920
freedom and the

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,760
so things like relaxation calming

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,000
but as we relax the body and relax the

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
mind as we comment

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,040
these things there is a letting go we're

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,079
releasing of ways that the body and mind

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,399
has been tight been clinging been

18
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,160
contracted

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,360
and that's a variation of the

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,160
more more

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,320
i don't know to say some more

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,719
significant forms of releasing of

23
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,520
clinging

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,159
which is the buddhist liberation

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,600
to become liberated to become

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,520
enlightened is to really have very deep

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,560
letting go

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,040
a deep releasing of clinging right down

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,439
to the core of our being

30
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,479
and um and so it's all a variation it's

31
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,640
all

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,799
a range a spectrum of releasing

33
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,000
something

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,880
that we're talking about here and so we

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,560
relax the body and we

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,360
and then to appreciate don't just relax

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,479
the body as we

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,880
start to meditate but appreciate the

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,200
consequences of the relaxation

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,640
the the the relief the openness the ease

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,399
the space the

42
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,520
the likeness uh the

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,840
the release of vitality that might come

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
with relaxation

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
uh when we relax the mental formations

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,439
relax the mental activity the tensions

47
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,840
and the contractions of the mind

48
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,159
uh it's not just a matter of relaxing it

49
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,320
it's also appreciating the consequence

50
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,840
of that

51
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,120
greater ease or lightness or space or or

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,640
openness that might be there and so

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,560
also when we let go of thinking that

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,239
that some people let go of thinking and

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,000
immediately go back to the breathing

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,200
as if but just take a few moments

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,640
to let go of thinking and to appreciate

58
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,800
whatever goodness that comes from the

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,879
space the openness the

60
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,519
lack of contraction lacks of tightness

61
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,160
the

62
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,560
lack of compulsion that might be there

63
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,280
in the letting go

64
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,640
of the thoughts and so one of the ways

65
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,720
of practicing meditation then at some

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,959
point as we settle in further

67
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,920
is to just appreciate letting go letting

68
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,720
go

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
letting go of anything the mind wants to

70
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,959
pick up on or get involved in

71
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,720
and just let go any kind of attention to

72
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,640
any kind of pulling attention to

73
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,720
emotions and thoughts

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,560
as much as we respect these and include

75
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,319
them as part of meditation

76
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,040
there is an art to also letting go of

77
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,840
any

78
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,879
preoccupation with them any

79
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,080
prioritization of them any

80
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,560
extra interest or even any in interest

81
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,519
in them

82
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,640
everything is allowed to be as it is

83
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,440
we're not dismissing anything what we're

84
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,560
really letting go of

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,200
is the clinging to things the tightening

86
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,879
and the tension around

87
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,200
what's happening so at some point

88
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,959
meditation just the process of letting

89
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:37,920
go

90
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,920
letting go letting go

91
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,599
and and uh so

92
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,440
assuming a meditation posture

93
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,280
and

94
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,200
i often suggest closing the eyes at the

95
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,599
beginning of meditation

96
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,640
and as you do so you might take a moment

97
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,519
to see if you can appreciate how the

98
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,519
relief for the eyes

99
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,080
not to be engaged in looking and seeing

100
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,840
maybe there's a that gives a kind of a

101
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,720
rest for the eyes

102
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,560
and if the eyes are not don't feel

103
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,079
restful

104
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,120
maybe it's possible to

105
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,160
um to

106
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,440
let the eyes eyes rest in their sockets

107
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,120
almost as if you're looking down

108
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:44,320
and backwards and then taking a few

109
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,440
somewhat deeper breaths so you can

110
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,000
really

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,080
let go and relax on the exhale

112
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,840
really emphasizing softening the body

113
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:11,199
calming the agitations of the body

114
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,280
and then letting the breath return to

115
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,680
normal

116
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,240
and then to

117
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,479
as you exhale to continue to relax

118
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,320
the body calm the body

119
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,800
but to take a few moments to feel

120
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,440
the goodness whatever nice feelings this

121
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,880
greater vitality that come from relaxing

122
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,960
feel the resulting calmness tranquility

123
00:05:50,960 --> 00:06:07,840
in that part of your body

124
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,880
relaxing the shoulders the belly

125
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,840
the face

126
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,199
sometimes it's possible to relax the

127
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,840
whole body

128
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,840
and sometimes it's possible to calm

129
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,960
a body-wide feeling of agitation

130
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,599
a calming

131
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:45,440
wave through the body with as you exhale

132
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,800
and also gently tenderly as you exhale

133
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,199
to relax any agitation

134
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,319
calm any agitation in the mind the

135
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,280
mental activity

136
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,479
letting go relaxing any tension or

137
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,280
contraction

138
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,960
in the mind or in the or in that part of

139
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,199
the body associated with your mental

140
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
activity

141
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,000
to calm

142
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:41,839
the agitation of the mind

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,480
and then to let go of your thoughts

144
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,560
or at least let go of your involvement

145
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,440
with your thinking

146
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,920
they appreciate

147
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,240
that there's more space in the mind to

148
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,279
be aware

149
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,800
when we let go of our thinking

150
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,040
and let that space of awareness

151
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,839
be filled with the experience of

152
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
breathing

153
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:37,839
breathing in and breathing out

154
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,240
and then as we continue sitting this

155
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,320
morning

156
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,839
with every exhale

157
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,480
say the word letting go

158
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,839
let go not as a command

159
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,120
but as a invitation

160
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,120
for us to let go of something

161
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,120
that the mind is has taken up

162
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,399
to let go of the energy of holding on

163
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,320
or picking up or being involved in

164
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,519
anything at all

165
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,480
just let go

166
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,760
and on the inhale appreciate

167
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,160
the goodness the spaciousness the

168
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,800
openness

169
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,240
of that letting go

170
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,480
letting go and the exhale

171
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,680
appreciating

172
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,639
the good results of letting go

173
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,160
and just keep letting go

174
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,839
as if for these minutes meditation

175
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,440
everything that arises

176
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,760
everything that you know nurses known

177
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,160
is another thing to let go of

178
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,800
to be open and fresh for the next moment

179
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:57,839
just let go

180
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:45,839
let go

181
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,240
let go as if letting go is the most

182
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,199
important thing to do nothing to hold on

183
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,360
to

184
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,680
nothing to be concerned about

185
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,839
just let go

186
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
so

187
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,839
so

188
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,839
so

189
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
so

190
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,480
what are you not letting go of

191
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,799
what can you still let go of to be

192
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,440
thorough

193
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,840
and letting go

194
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
um

195
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
so

196
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,840
so

197
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,640
and then as we come to the end of the

198
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
sitting

199
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,840
perhaps to appreciate

200
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,080
the greater letting go there is

201
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,440
the more space there is

202
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,840
for love

203
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,279
the more space there is for good will

204
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,919
kindness

205
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
tenderness

206
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,640
the more there is the opposite of love

207
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,600
the less room

208
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,279
there is for love

209
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,159
the more time and space is taken up with

210
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:14,880
clinging

211
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,840
and reacting and being preoccupied

212
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,480
they're less time there is less space

213
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,840
there is for friendliness

214
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,520
not the love or friendliness that

215
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,919
is an obligation or something we have to

216
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,480
muster up

217
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,760
but rather something deeper more

218
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,080
simple and that comes out of the

219
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,840
tenderness

220
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,559
gentleness

221
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:53,840
of our hearts our minds

222
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,158
to let go

223
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,840
so that without work and without

224
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,760
obligation

225
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,720
we can receive other people into our

226
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,960
hearts

227
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,720
in the place where there's tender

228
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,440
friendliness

229
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,080
sometimes in buddhism there's an

230
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,120
expression

231
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,480
tender compassion

232
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,360
and again without any obligations or

233
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,600
is there a place in your heart

234
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,000
in the simplicity of being here having

235
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,200
let go

236
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,440
where your heart's tender good will

237
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,080
could if it wanted to be expressed in

238
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,720
the words

239
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,399
may others be

240
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,799
happy

241
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:17,840
may others be safe

242
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,000
may others be peaceful

243
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,840
may others be free

244
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,679
and may i live a life

245
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,840
that supports that to happen

246
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,279
may this meditation practice we've done

247
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,159
together today

248
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,840
may it be so that we can live a life

249
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,559
that benefits

250
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,960
and supports the welfare and happiness

251
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,559
of all beings

252
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,000
may all beings be happy

253
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:27,840
and free
