1
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,840
so welcome welcome everybody it's nice to see you all to be practicing together

2
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,680
so we'll start just with a silent sit and nancy will read the we'll ring the bell

3
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,879
for us at 8 15. you're welcome come on in no problem

4
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,959
and also a welcome to our friends from the other side of this camera

5
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,160
on youtube welcome

6
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,840
so

7
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,400
up

8
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,839
and

9
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,438
uh

10
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,679
so

11
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:23,360
part of the beauty of this practice

12
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:31,559
is that we don't have to do anything special

13
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,120
we just show up the way that we are

14
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,000
and we notice

15
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,840
how are we

16
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,799
what's happening this moment

17
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,799
there's a trust

18
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,320
for this moment it's sufficient just to pay attention

19
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:26,080
we don't have to do anything different we don't have to breathe different

20
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:34,080
often we sit in this way just to support the posture but we don't have to sit in this way

21
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,159
we're just noticing

22
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:46,640
with and letting the body breathe itself

23
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,279
and letting the mind notice

24
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,638
so

25
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,839
so

26
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:02,078
we can be mindful of whatever is arising

27
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,800
might be sounds

28
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,200
might be experiences in the body

29
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,520
maybe there's some sensations

30
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,320
where we're sitting on the cushion

31
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:39,520
and we can notice our relationship to those experiences

32
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:53,359
is there ease is there aversion

33
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,839
no matter what you find

34
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,920
can you just hold it

35
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,599
without a sense that it has to be different

36
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:26,160
we're just noticing with mindfulness practice we're not breathing in any particular

37
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:35,200
way we're not doing any particular thing we're just noticing

38
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,880
it can be sounds sensations the breath

39
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,839
and when you find yourself lost in thought

40
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,240
it doesn't have to be a problem just

41
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,720
begin again

42
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:33,839
so [Music]

43
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,839
so

44
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:31,520
so maybe i'll let those of you that are leaving oh okay pick your exit if you'd like or

45
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,839
can stay

46
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:43,440
tonight i'd like to continue on my

47
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:49,359
just exploration or the discussion about these seven factors of awakening

48
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:56,400
they sound so lofty right these factors of awakening it sounds a little formulaic too as long

49
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:03,119
as i just get these factors right then i'll be awake and easy peasy

50
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:11,040
so tonight i'd like to talk about the fourth factor of awakening which is joy

51
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:16,240
i know i was surprised to learn that joy is part of this

52
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,760
awakening schema just quickly i'll say that first

53
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,280
starts with mindfulness and then investigation then energy

54
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:35,079
then joy then tranquility concentration and equanimity

55
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:41,520
seven factors of awakening and

56
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:48,160
in some ways we can think about you know this path towards awakening

57
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,359
is related to this uh the four noble truths it's kind

58
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:58,559
of the quintessential buddhist teachings

59
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:04,240
the truth of there is suffering the arising of suffering

60
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:09,599
there's the ending of suffering the cessation of suffering and there's a way

61
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:15,119
leading to this cessation of suffering and so

62
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:20,559
the seven factors maybe are we could consider as part of the way cultivating them

63
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:26,000
but this one joy in particular is with the third normal truth the

64
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,440
ending of suffering right when there's joy present there's not a lot of suffering

65
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:37,440
and i appreciate this very much because often it's easy to fall into this idea

66
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:43,040
that at the end there's going to be some whatever the end is right but there'll

67
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:48,079
be some shep zam kind of moment and there'll be no suffering but we have to

68
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:54,559
wait until completely the end but it's not like that right the

69
00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:01,440
means and the end are related so there's all these little letting goes of suffering that's happening with our

70
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,440
practice there's all this joy some of it's joy not all of it some of

71
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:14,800
it is joy that's just part of the practice so i'm going to talk a little bit about that tonight

72
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,800
but before i do before i talk about a little bit about joy i want to talk

73
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:26,880
about how we don't talk about joy very often

74
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:33,040
there aren't that many dharma talks about this there aren't so many buddhist books on this i guess maybe there are

75
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,240
some but right when we think about buddhist practice we think about it's grim

76
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:45,359
suffering very often but i will say as a general in general

77
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:50,640
as a society we don't really appreciate joy

78
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,240
as much as we appreciate like productivity or efficiency or something

79
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:02,559
like this so this idea of cultivating joy

80
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:09,760
is maybe doesn't even enter our minds or it's really low priority

81
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,880
so it might even just be some a new idea

82
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:22,640
that we can cultivate it and that it's encouraged to cultivate it

83
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:28,480
because in some ways joy can be really restorative and that the same way

84
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:36,480
that a beautiful delicious meal can be it can kind of be some nourishment and maybe

85
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,720
provide some uplift or some energy or something like this in the same way

86
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:48,720
there's maybe like some inner hunger some spiritual hunger or

87
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:57,359
whatever words you might use that joy can help address or heal or alleviate or

88
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:01,200
diminish something like this

89
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:08,800
another reason why we might not like hold joy or cultivating joy into

90
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:15,520
such a high esteem is we might have this idea that joy and happiness these are

91
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:24,240
luxuries we might have this idea okay oh yeah okay they're very important but i'll get around to them after i solve this big

92
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,680
giant problem or after my life is

93
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:36,319
just and everything is in place and then i'll go you know look at some joy it's easy

94
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:42,559
to fall into those types of thinking but i'd like to encourage us that no

95
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:47,839
this is an integral part of our practice without feeling oppressed that we have

96
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:55,280
to feel happy and joyful all the time right that has its own tyranny or it can

97
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:02,880
another reason why some people might have this hesitation around joy is

98
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,000
maybe they want to just stay kind of like in the middle

99
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,119
of the emotional range not too many eyes not too many lows kind

100
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,480
of if they could have this really narrow range that their emotional life is in

101
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:24,160
then maybe they won't suffer some of the really lows that are possible as humans

102
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:30,400
if we kind of dampen any highs maybe we won't feel any lows there's a way in which we might have

103
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:37,839
this kind of like unspoken or maybe not even really we're so aware of but this

104
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:44,720
idea in the back of our mind somewhere like okay i'm just going to keep all my emotions in this narrow range enjoy

105
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:50,480
sounds like it's a little little too much

106
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:58,640
part of that also is that if we keep our emotions in this kind of

107
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:05,680
narrow range then maybe we also have this idea we are protecting ourselves from any sense of

108
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:13,520
disappointment like if i'm kind of always assuming the worst

109
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:20,400
then i won't feel so bad when the worst actually happens i can say oh yeah see i was right

110
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:26,559
but you know this comes at a cost that sometimes we don't even recognize

111
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,000
this not availing ourselves of the delights and the joys the happinesses

112
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,079
that are possible and i know that i found myself doing

113
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:44,079
this whenever like a project like oh yeah it'll take

114
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:50,960
three to four days i just naturally assumed okay it's gonna take five days we'll deliver that in four to six weeks

115
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:58,240
okay it'll take seven weeks you know i just kind of don't want to be disappointed so i i'm assuming the worst

116
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:05,280
and then just noticing i don't have to do that it can be three to four weeks and if it

117
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,720
turns out to be five weeks i can just deal with it then

118
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:17,760
without having to kind of like preemptively try to make sure that i never feel disappointed

119
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,559
or something like this

120
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:31,599
another reason why we might feel hesitant to cultivate joy oh i forgot to turn on the recorder

121
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:37,920
so i'm going to turn on the recording and i'm just gonna repeat like one minute just to introduce what i'm

122
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:44,319
talking about okay so for the purpose of the recording

123
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:50,640
i have been talking for a little bit but i'm just gonna say that i'm talking about joy

124
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:56,079
and i've listed a number of reasons why we might be hesitant to

125
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:01,440
cultivate joy and i'm just going to continue on this list

126
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,000
for the benefit of those of you who have been here the whole time

127
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:13,760
but one reason why we might feel hesitant or somehow maybe just doesn't feel right it

128
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,280
feels uncomfortable to cultivate joy it's because

129
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:24,318
there's so many sorrows in this world

130
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:32,319
there's suffering everywhere and somehow maybe we just don't feel right like well who am i

131
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:37,599
or i do is it okay or something like this

132
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:43,440
i appreciate very much jill shepherd a wonderful dharma teacher

133
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:49,040
she says it is precisely because there's so much suffering in the

134
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:54,839
world that i've needed to make the effort to turn toward

135
00:56:54,839 --> 00:57:02,400
non-suffering towards gladness towards joy in order to restore myself

136
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:08,000
so that i can face life's challenges just this way of taking care of

137
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,920
ourselves and staying balanced in the midst so we're not trying to be pollyanna

138
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:21,119
we're not trying to like turn away from all the difficulties we're just kind of like opening it up

139
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:28,079
yes there is suffering and difficulties but that's not the only thing in the world there's all also beautiful things

140
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:35,599
happening babies are getting born it's so beautiful people are getting married

141
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:40,720
people are getting dream jobs they're getting good news from the doctor's

142
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,359
office these things are happening too

143
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:52,799
and this poem by rosemary traumer i appreciate very much how she's

144
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:58,240
pointing to how just a little bit of joy can kind of

145
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:04,318
restore us or support us in the midst of all the difficulties

146
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:11,440
so this poem by rosemary trauma is called strange balance

147
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:18,160
let's see here so make sure that i have this here we go

148
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:24,319
when the boy is sneering or the glass is breaking

149
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:30,079
or the woman is weeping or the streets are crowded with anger

150
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:35,680
and rage it is hard to believe a small joy has

151
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:42,000
any real value hard to believe a single red gerber

152
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,839
daisy or a cup of grapefruit scented tea might have

153
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:53,200
any relevance could bear any weight on the scale that

154
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:58,400
measures what it is to be alive but

155
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:05,040
last night while i was steeping in worry aching with injustice

156
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:10,480
my daughter created a stage between the threadbare couches

157
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:16,079
and hummed herself a soundtrack as she lapped and spun and shuffled and flapped

158
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:22,000
and oh how her her brief flair of joy

159
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,720
changed the flavor of the night an

160
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:33,839
improbable balance the way even the smallest

161
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:39,920
amount of sugar transforms the bitter sauce

162
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:46,720
the way just one note resolves a minor chord

163
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:55,200
the way the barest hint of rain makes the whole desert erupt into bloom

164
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:03,920
i'll read this last stanza an improbable balance

165
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:11,040
the way even the smallest amount of sugar transforms the bitter sauce

166
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:16,079
the way just one note resolves a minor chord

167
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:24,559
the way the the barest hint of rain makes the whole desert erupt into bloom

168
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:31,760
sometimes we forget this sometimes we forget that

169
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:37,760
it's we don't need like this same amount of

170
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:43,838
bitterness just a little bit of sugar can shift it

171
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:50,480
we don't have to change all the notes in the chord just one

172
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:57,839
so there it doesn't have to be this equal balance so sometimes it's easy to be dismissive of like joy or happiness

173
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:03,280
or well-being when it arises think it doesn't matter it's not going to make a difference

174
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,400
but it can and it does this is why it's in a factor of

175
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:13,359
awakening it does make a difference

176
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:20,720
and then maybe this last on this list of why we might have this hesitation

177
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:26,480
to cultivate joy or even to think about joy as part of our spiritual practice as

178
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:31,599
a support for awakening is we have this idea that we're not

179
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,640
supposed to cling to pleasure right sense pleasures

180
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:44,079
that's not the way to awakening if it were like all of us in the western world would be awakened by now right

181
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:50,400
kind of after how we're chasing after pleasant experience after pleasant experience

182
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:58,319
but we might have this idea okay so such pleasures that's not the way to weakening and to it's not a source of

183
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:04,720
lasting happiness but there might be a way which we're kind of conflating joy

184
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:09,839
and sense pleasure it makes sense there's they're kind of in the same

185
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:15,839
neighborhood but i'd like to unpack it a little bit and talk about how joy

186
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:21,359
is different but maybe i'll point to there's all

187
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:27,039
kinds of skillful beautiful

188
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:34,079
inner experiences that are wise to cultivate and

189
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:39,680
experience and really have as part of our lives

190
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:45,680
generosity gratitude contentment

191
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:52,240
equanimity happiness joy is in this list too

192
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:59,920
but different than sense pleasures but they really serve to help sustain us and nourish us

193
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,720
on this path in this life

194
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:12,079
so maybe i'll just add this that when you feel like you're stuck in your

195
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:18,240
practice or you've lost momentum and kind of wondering

196
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:23,680
what am i doing here you can ask yourself

197
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:30,640
well what is your way that you're relating to some of these pleasant experiences that are just

198
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,760
arising as part of meditation practice or part of your whatever your spiritual

199
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:42,240
practice might be and might there be like a secret aesthetic streak that like i can't have

200
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:47,680
anything that's enjoyable or pleasant no pain no gain if it doesn't hurt it's not

201
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:53,839
going anywhere you could just check to see if there's a maybe a quiet little

202
01:03:53,839 --> 01:04:01,119
belief like that that's operating for you i'm not saying that meditation will be

203
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:08,400
fun and delightful all the time any of you who have meditated before know this is not true

204
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:14,240
but we can just check to see if you feel it feels dry and

205
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:21,920
there's no enjoyment nosing no happiness no i don't know juiciness to it just check

206
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:28,880
see if what your relationship is to your any pleasant experiences that are arising

207
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:35,920
maybe i'll just say even because you know the buddha got it wrong even this

208
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:41,200
before he was awakened we call him the bodhisattva before he was a buddha right

209
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:47,119
his life stories he had this life of incredible sensual pleasures

210
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:56,960
so that's not going to work that's not working went the other way to have like asceticism no essential pleasures at all

211
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:02,400
and it was until the story is that he had some meditative ease

212
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:08,160
while being calm this kind of inner joy

213
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:14,480
that he realized oh this is the way this is the way this beautiful in inner

214
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:20,078
joy this is the way and that's part of the teaching

215
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:27,039
so maybe i'll unpack a little bit what i'm talking about when i'm saying this word joy

216
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:32,960
there's a joy that can arise from engaging with the practice with

217
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:38,240
meditation practice as buddhist practice in a wholehearted way

218
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:44,000
without straining without a lot of ambition or a lot of i

219
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:51,039
gotta make this work kind of feeling not you know like uh clenching our teeth and holding on as

220
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:57,440
tight as we can but more of this uplifting feeling this kind of like

221
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:04,559
energetic feeling so i'm using the word joy to translate

222
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:11,119
the poly word pt and there's three words in poly that are related and

223
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:16,559
different translators translate them in different ways i'm going to talk about them in a little

224
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:24,160
bit here so i'm going to use three different words gladness joy and happiness

225
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:30,960
this is one way that i kind of like to describe them gladness pamoja

226
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:38,079
in poly gladness is like when you've been busy for hours during

227
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:43,200
whatever and you realize oh yeah i was supposed to stay hydrated and you

228
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:49,760
go and drink a glass of water and that just if it just feels good having this glass of water

229
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:57,359
it's not anything you're going to write home about but it just feels good you're doing something good for yourself you're like oh maybe i was a little bit thirsty

230
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:03,039
i didn't even recognize it i would say that's gladness this sense of oh that

231
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:08,799
was nice joy i'm saying it's more like champagne

232
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:15,760
wahoo this fantastic they're celebrating and there's a lot of energy and kind of like a lot of uplift so drinking

233
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:21,440
something that's carbonated and bubbly and joy has a little bit of that feeling right we have champagne at big

234
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:27,599
celebrations happiness i'm saying it's more like hot chocolate

235
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:33,839
it's more like this coziness maybe around a campfire with family members or

236
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:40,400
you know something like this with maybe marshmallows on top you know this kind of this

237
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:45,680
happiness this feeling love so that's how i'm kind of making it a

238
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:52,000
distinction between gladness joy and happiness and i'll become clear in a minute here

239
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,119
why i'm making this distinction

240
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:03,839
so joy i described it as kind of this energetic bubbly experience

241
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:12,000
but it's a wide spectrum it can be just maybe even a little

242
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,838
tingly like this inner tingly you know like when you just

243
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:25,679
when it's uh your birthday and and you somebody that you hadn't heard from in a long time

244
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:33,359
sends you a message oh happy birthday and it's just a little like oh that was so nice or something like this

245
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:38,640
and the spectrum goes all the way to like sticking your finger in an electric

246
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:44,159
socket you know real very powerful physical

247
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:49,278
um waves or a little bit overwhelming can be overwhelming

248
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:57,040
for some people it's really can be a lot so this really wide range maybe sometimes

249
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:02,159
it feels like um a little bit like hair standing up

250
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:07,560
or it feels like um

251
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:14,318
yeah they're just uplift i like this word kind of like a bubbly uplift

252
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:22,238
there's absolutely no requirement that it has to be anywhere on the spectrum everybody is different some people i

253
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:30,880
don't know why have you knock your socks off kind and some kind of have a more subtle quiet

254
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:36,400
they are not different in terms of what's gonna support your practice

255
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:42,480
they are not different in what means you're a better meditator or more spiritual or anything like that

256
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:48,640
there's no correlation whatsoever between the intensity and how it is

257
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,400
and your practice is unfolding

258
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:01,199
so there's a wide spectrum and i'll also say it can just be a brief moment

259
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:07,120
or it can last for a long time even when you get up maybe it arises

260
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:15,440
during meditation and when you get up and leave the meditation it still is with you in some kind of way

261
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:23,040
again it doesn't have to be any way it can be really short and really subtle

262
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:28,080
but one thing that's really powerful about i mean this joy

263
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:34,560
is that when that joy is there for the most part there's not ill will

264
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:43,600
there is not this of a little bit of hostility or aversion or something like that

265
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:51,040
and i talked about how the cessation of dukkha the third noble truth and joy is it related to

266
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:56,880
that well here's one way it's related the cessation of dukkha the cessation of

267
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:02,320
suffering difficulties is linked to the ending of greed hatred

268
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:09,360
and delusion and we can say that when joy is there this hatred is not there

269
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:14,719
and there's a softening of the greed and a softening of the delusion

270
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:19,920
this is one way in which it's just support for our practice

271
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:27,120
so i've mentioned that pt joy shows up in the seven factors of

272
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:32,560
awakening but i want to talk about how it shows up

273
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:38,719
in this teaching that we don't talk about as often one thing that we can name this is the

274
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:45,199
gladness pentad i just like that kind of it's not an alliteration there's a word for that

275
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:50,480
when the same sound in the middle of the word gladness pentad

276
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:59,760
it goes gladness joy tranquility happiness concentration

277
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:05,920
and it's this what makes this pentahod so special

278
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:12,719
is that if this is a like a cascade event it's like dominoes

279
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:19,679
it's like water rolling downhill gladness

280
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:25,120
creates the conditions for joy increase the condition

281
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:33,679
let's see yes for tranquility creates the conditions for happiness creates the conditions for concentration

282
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:41,199
so it's when these like these good or wholesome qualities just lead

283
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:46,559
one to the other and so

284
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:53,520
the buddha he talked about this and we might have okay diana maybe this

285
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:59,040
sounds interesting this gladness bent out but i don't feel glad at this moment

286
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:04,480
how do we if this is true these dominoes is naturally flowing

287
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:09,600
but how do we start with gladness how do we

288
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,800
allow this to unfold so here is a

289
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:21,120
an excerpt from asuta buddha says an ethical person

290
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:27,440
need not make a wish that may i have no regrets it's only natural

291
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:33,679
that an ethical person has no regrets you have no regrets you do not

292
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:39,760
need to make a wish may i feel gladness it's only natural

293
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:46,640
that gladness arises when you have no regrets when you feel gladness you need not make

294
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:52,480
a wish may i experience joy it's only natural

295
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:58,560
that joy arises when you feel gladness

296
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:04,640
when your mind is full of joy you need not make a wish may my body become tranquil

297
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:11,600
it's only natural that your body becomes tranquil when your mind is full of joy

298
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:16,800
when your body is tranquil you need not make a wish may i feel happiness

299
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:22,960
it's only natural to feel happiness when your body is tranquil

300
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:31,920
when your body when you feel happiness that you need not make a wish may my mind be immersed

301
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:38,880
in concentration it's only natural for the mind to become immersed in concentration when you feel

302
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:46,719
happiness kind of this rhythm just pointing to how this flows and this

303
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:55,080
list continues goes past concentration it goes to liberation

304
01:14:56,159 --> 01:15:02,560
so it starts just with this idea of some not having regrets

305
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:08,320
not having remorse living our life in such a way

306
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:14,320
that we have the least amount of regrets remorse possible

307
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:21,360
and it doesn't mean that we never can ever do anything you know that isn't perfect again right

308
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:28,159
we don't have to wait for that we can reflect on and remember some of the good

309
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:33,760
things that we're doing have done we don't have to wait until we've done

310
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:38,679
absolutely everything perfect all the time

311
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:44,239
those times when we put the shopping cart back to the place where you put them in in the

312
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:48,639
parking lot instead of just leaving it next to your car

313
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:55,360
a time when you called your friend that you knew was having a tough time

314
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:05,440
when you told the teller at this store oh wait i think you gave me a 10 back but i only needed a 5.

315
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:11,199
these small things we can allow ourselves

316
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:18,080
we can recognize this in ourselves yes i i am doing some of these good things in the

317
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:23,280
world without waiting until we're absolutely perfect

318
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:29,360
and then allow ourselves to feel the gladness of that and feel

319
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:34,840
the appreciation for this

320
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:40,800
this recognition that our life is going in a direction

321
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:47,520
we're in a way that we would want it to go with i have to say this every time

322
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:55,760
without demanding we may not be there yet but we're going this direction

323
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:02,960
and so it turns out there's actually quite a few things that can start this gladness penthead it's not only the

324
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:09,360
absence of regret or remorse it's not only like ethical conduct

325
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:15,280
we might say that there's this movement of the heart that starts gladness

326
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:21,600
faith this confidence and this practice

327
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:28,880
sometimes we only have that after we've been practicing for a while and we have this confidence that okay yeah this

328
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:35,760
is tough but i know that with my mindfulness practice i can hold it

329
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:42,560
there's also a this expression kind of like unwavering confidence in the buddha

330
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:49,199
dharma and sangha there comes a time in practice when we feel like

331
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:54,239
this this this is for me i this

332
01:17:54,239 --> 01:18:02,800
i'm gonna take refuge in that buddha dharma and sangha this i'm gonna make this the orientation of my life

333
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:08,320
it doesn't have to be for everybody i'm not here to convert anyone

334
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:14,480
but there when you have this clarity about where direction your life is going

335
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:19,520
there can be some gladness about that but it also

336
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:24,719
points to this gladness arises when there's this untroubled mind

337
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:30,560
i could point to this non-regret but also this idea of

338
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:35,678
let me talk about this is guarding the scent stores

339
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:42,000
not going down the cookie aisle when we're trying not to eat cookies

340
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:48,640
or lessen our cookie intake not

341
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:54,640
spending all the time on the internet just scrolling or doom-scrolling

342
01:18:54,640 --> 01:19:04,320
if we feel like you know it's not good for our mental health we find ourselves in a bad mood and fearful and angry

343
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:13,280
to not not go outside wait to yet to not go

344
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:19,040
outside or move our bodies in some ways that's healthy and supportive

345
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:25,360
regarding the scent stores can be a way in which we are taking care of what we know to be

346
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:31,040
helpful and supportive and trying to we don't have to eliminate them we don't

347
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:37,840
have to have this move live in some pristine but just this recognition of what is

348
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:43,920
supportive and what isn't and can we put our energy and our

349
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,880
attention there

350
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:56,960
and lastly i'll say in this list the things that can allow the gladness to arise

351
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:03,120
is to work with or have some awareness of the five hindrances

352
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:08,560
so for those of you who are familiar with that i'll just list them

353
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:13,600
and i'll just say this i appreciate this very much that

354
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:19,440
thousands of years ago they were talking about this they were talking about

355
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:25,760
sometimes when you're meditating you just feel like you just want something sometimes you want to jump up and run

356
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:31,920
out right or sometimes you feel like no i don't want something and we just feel

357
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:37,360
unsettled because we want something we don't want something or we just feel like we have

358
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:44,719
too much energy and restless and fidgety and can't sit still or we feel like we're falling asleep you

359
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:50,159
know this kind of thing or maybe we can't decide what practice to

360
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:55,840
do we feel like i don't know there's this so i do mindfulness of breathing should

361
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:00,880
i do mindfulness of sounds try to do mindful body should i do loving kindness

362
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:06,400
whatever so this unhesitation and uncertainty

363
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:13,600
the five entrances so maybe i'll end there with this idea

364
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:21,199
of joy as an awakening factor it's an integral part of our practice

365
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:27,760
to not dismiss it we can't really notice it when it arises

366
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:33,280
and a support for joy is gladness

367
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:39,760
something that's a little bit more mundane maybe it's more just a general sense of well-being

368
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:46,639
and we can tune into this well-being and we can allow it to

369
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:51,840
maybe expand or grow

370
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:59,120
and then it can shift into joy but often joy arises in initially in a

371
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:04,560
meditative context when there's a certain amount of um

372
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:10,960
stability and not a lot going on so often it's you know we've been meditating for a little bit longer and

373
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:17,360
then once the mind and the body have a sense of like oh wow okay i didn't even know that kind of

374
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:24,000
joy was possible then the body and the mind had access to that outside of the meditative

375
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,040
experience so often it first arises in the meditative setting

376
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:36,000
but then it can arise in other settings so joy

377
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:43,440
it can be subtle it can be quiet it can be really powerful

378
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:50,000
but just an opportunity for us to think about the role it has in our practice

379
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:58,000
as well as the role our relationship to joy as in our practice

380
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:05,280
so with that i wish you all lots of gladness and joy in your life

381
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:10,800
while meditating while not meditating on the cushion off a cushion everywhere

382
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,280
thank you

383
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:23,600
and so if you'd like uh like to ask some questions we can maybe pass the mic

384
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:27,199
around if there are some questions

385
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,880
there might not be that's okay

386
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:42,960
hi good morning good morning good evening thank you um i have a question regarding

387
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:48,480
how to remind myself to not just to see

388
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:55,280
like about joy like if i'm feeling really overwhelmed with something and i know you had mentioned

389
01:23:55,280 --> 01:24:01,600
uh just like a single dropper it doesn't have to be super big like i received

390
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:08,080
this morning a birthday card that my mentor sent to me and that was a moment

391
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:13,280
of joy that i had before i was brushing off to work but i

392
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:19,360
is it just being mindful and present is that one of the ways

393
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:24,880
yeah yeah that's one of the ways that we can be with joyright is just notice when

394
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:32,239
they naturally arise like you just described and maybe you've heard this rick hansen he says that um

395
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:38,320
how does he say this this i don't remember his exact words it's like the uncomfortable experiences are like

396
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:45,679
velcro really sticky and the pleasant experiences are like teflon they just uh slide right off

397
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:52,639
but we would need to spend a little bit of effort when they do arise to like wait wait wait wait

398
01:24:52,639 --> 01:25:00,400
let's let's you know uh go back and if we can like wait how does this feel in the body

399
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:06,880
how does this feel in the in the moment so that's one to savor it when it does arise

400
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:13,679
but you started by asking when can i remember and you s and you said when something is

401
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:20,400
overwhelming this of course is a great question we want to be experiencing joy right rather

402
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:26,560
than any overwhelming experience i'll just say briefly there's a few things

403
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:32,480
one is is a way to put the brakes on the overwhelm

404
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:38,960
we might still have to be having some difficulties but to get so it's not overwhelming is the first

405
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:44,719
step i would say and there's a few ways we can do that one

406
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:51,600
that when we're like in overwhelm or when we're like right on the brink we don't have access to our wisdom we're

407
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:59,280
not gonna remember joy we're looking at this stuff right you might have this wish that we could but

408
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:06,159
here's something that's can be really helpful is just simply feel your feet on the ground

409
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:11,199
there's something it's very simple and it's kind of literally grounding and it

410
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:16,320
kind of like interrupts the what the mind is doing the mind is often kind of

411
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:21,440
like oh my gosh what am i going to do about this and this means that and i better get around to this and i can't believe this happened

412
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:29,679
we often the mind when we're in overwhelm is going fast or or it's going really slow and can't land on anything

413
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:35,679
so to feel the feet on the ground is one way to just stop the overwhelm

414
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:40,960
and then often there's a number of things and then i'll just say this one other thing

415
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:48,719
just i could give a whole talk on this right a whole another 45 minutes and i have and other people have to

416
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:57,440
one thing that can be helpful is to find anything neutral to look at and what i

417
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:03,280
mean by neutral i mean boring like just to look at the

418
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:08,880
corner of the door where the door meets the

419
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:14,639
let's i'll just say this corners where the door meets that corner there and then there's a corner here where two

420
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:20,560
walls here's a corner on this chair there's a corner on this step here

421
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:26,719
there's a corner on my little podium thing and about that fast and it's helpful to

422
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:32,880
actually move your head there's like a physiological reason for this

423
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:39,120
so just this looking at things that are boring neutral like corners where two things

424
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:46,159
are meeting will help us get out of overwhelm really just kind of like slows everything down

425
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:53,040
and kind of brings a little bit boring and then you might have access to

426
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:58,080
all your wisdom and memories of joy or something like that so

427
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:04,719
that was maybe more than you asked but uh no it's great thank you so much diane yeah yeah that's some kind of practical

428
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:11,280
things and what we can do when we are feeling overwhelmed

429
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:19,120
thank you um i i think i can relate especially in retreats right once you've

430
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:24,560
been practicing you know by the second or third day you

431
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:29,920
at least for me i i i'm allowed i allow myself these experiences that that

432
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:35,920
certainly go even i would say from joy to euphoria and

433
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:41,440
and i worry sometimes because the other side of that is you you can become

434
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:47,199
clingy to that you know and say oh boy i didn't that didn't happen again you know so

435
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:52,239
you know it's obviously wonderful when it happens but it also you know kind of the oscillation of the

436
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:58,320
emotions is itself kind of a part of the reason i meditate right because it helps me stay

437
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:03,440
you know the equanimity so equanimity and joy seem to almost be you know

438
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:09,440
kind of opposites in some sense you know but anyway i i i i'm curious because i feel like euphoria is outside you didn't

439
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:15,120
mention you for you're very sort of outside the spectrum of where you'd want to go so how do you sort of manage that

440
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:21,199
you know yeah yeah thank you that's a good question yeah so sometimes there is euphoria is a

441
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:27,679
good thing arises does this kind of arise like usually in a kind of a meditative context often on retreat when you've

442
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:33,040
been in there for a while and enjoy it

443
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:40,080
roll around in it drink it up you know just hang out in it and i don't know a single person that

444
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:45,440
cannot cling to that so and you'll cling to it this is what

445
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:51,440
will happen and you'll try to recreate it like wait i was wearing these socks and sitting in

446
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:57,520
this place and you know just exactly trying to get it again

447
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:04,400
everybody will do this this is just how it happens and then i don't know then it will rise again

448
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:11,040
when the conditions are right often when we're not grasping and then we'll hold we'll cling to it

449
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:16,960
again and then it's only after it starts to arise a little bit more regularly then

450
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:24,800
we can let go of the clinging so there's but what often sometimes we do is when there's um

451
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:31,920
we kind of beat ourselves up like oh i'm having i'm clinging for this nice experience and i shouldn't but give

452
