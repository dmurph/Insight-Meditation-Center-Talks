00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:07,560
hello and welcome to our Monday beginning of the week series of

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:16,400
meditations and teachings overall we're doing samadi over this extended period of

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,760
time and in thinking about samadi

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:29,119
um many people consider somebody the same as concentration and that is the same as

5
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:36,440
some kind of mental laser focus of the mind that happens from the control

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,520
tower another way of thinking about it is that the word samadi

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,879
is uh can also be understood in the very related words

8
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:58,559
samati uh can also be understood as um a subtleness to be settle deeply

9
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,119
settled and so in meditation in Buddhist teachings there are four dignified

10
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,920
postures for meditation and I love it when it's called

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,520
dignified there is walking

12
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:25,040
standing sitting and lying down but the kind of the the

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,320
representative for meditation is the sitting posture and the posture here we

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,759
have of the Buddha here next to me and

15
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:43,880
um and uh there's something that happens there in this posture if you if you

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,479
stand or if you sit in a balanced way rooted

17
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:57,600
upright in this kind of posture it allows something to settle to

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,840
relax the body then with time begins to relax the tensions the shoulders which

19
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,560
are tight the belly which is tight the upward kind of swirl of agitated energy

20
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,599
begins to settle and there's a feeling of subtleness a settling into the body

21
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,440
deeper in the body sense of gravity lowers the sense of being rooted and

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,040
grounded increases and um and that is not the

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,800
same thing has this laser focus of the Mind One Way of I understand it is that

24
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,400
it's kind of like a trampoline and if you lay down in the middle or sit in the middle of the

25
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,200
trampoline the trampoline settles and sags takes the weight receives it so

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,080
when we sit in a good way everything kind of settles down and that settling

27
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,599
point the lowest point of the trampoline then um is a little bit the center then

28
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:09,000
or the grounding the root for samadi and this can be done in any of

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,360
the four postures and uh but it takes some care to allow the posture to support

30
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,440
that to assume a posture which is aligned

31
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:29,000
or kind of where the in whatever way our body allows us

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,599
to do it that our body is

33
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:42,280
somehow um kind of in harmony with itself

34
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:52,000
or set up in a way that allows for something to settle there's not unnecessary tension or holding in the

35
00:03:53,159 --> 00:04:00,239
posture and then there's a settling that can happen and then we can become

36
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:08,120
whatever degree of subtleness we have we can become aware of what makes us

37
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,199
unsettled and when we feel unsettled when we lose that whatever degree of modum of subtleness we

38
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:23,519
have it's possible to become aware that we now

39
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,800
become uh fragmented we now kind of become we're prioritizing or the energy

40
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,360
and tension and activity is going into some part of the body

41
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:44,000
mind that um kind of stands out at the expense of the

42
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,919
whole but if we allow that to settle if we relax that then there's a

43
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:58,240
sense of settling back into the more the whole of what's here and to recognize the way in which

44
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,720
becoming unsettled there's less of us there less of our

45
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,600
wholeness there and when we return to a sense of feeling of more the whole of our body

46
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,840
mind and heart that allows the body mind and heart to settle

47
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,600
more not because we're making it settle but maybe because we're finding

48
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,479
that place at the center of the tra trampoline where something can rest

49
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:37,800
the mind can rest the body can kind of be at

50
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,960
ease so when I did Zen practice the instruction was to uh place

51
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:52,639
the mind let the Mind rest in the Hara in the in the rest in this deep

52
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,919
place about two Ines below the navl and let just that was a place where

53
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:05,960
things were rooted and settled and not to not to avoid everything

54
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,479
else but allow everything else to settle in the center of the

55
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,440
trampoline so to assume a meditation posture that's right for

56
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,880
you st sit walking standing sitting lying

57
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:37,039
down and move a little bit in the posture wiggle sway back and forth forward and

58
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,560
back twist a little bit and and then see it to come into

59
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,759
some kind of Center some kind of

60
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,400
midpoint where things seem most aligned

61
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:08,919
and sometimes it can be that the aligned posture can help it feel like the two

62
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:15,039
lungs as they breathe

63
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:23,199
breathing the experience of breathing has a

64
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:32,120
midpoint in the front of the Torso perhaps parallel to the spine spine

65
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:43,160
and where sensations of breathing arise and

66
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,639
settle and that AR rising of the inhale the exhale which can be a

67
00:07:52,639 --> 00:08:01,440
settling and letting go it's kind of like a

68
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:10,840
like needing bread kneading dough kind of a gentle kneading of the

69
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:19,879
body to soften it and settle it and support a

70
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,159
settling that you're not focused on doing

71
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,599
but that you're attuned to

72
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,680
doing and so if you haven't closed your eyes you might close your eyes to better

73
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,680
feel

74
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,399
sense the sensations

75
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,959
that come and go as you breathe in and

76
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,079
out perhaps relaxing on the exhale

77
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:40,600
or if there's nothing to relax on the exhale let there be a

78
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,720
calming a calming wave through your body

79
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,600
and there maybe a similar kind of kneading the

80
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,640
mind the thinking Mind by as you breathe in to feel the

81
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,000
sensations and energy activation of the thinking

82
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,600
mind and as you exhale to calm Cal the thinking

83
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,600
mind

84
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
soften

85
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
for

86
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
for for

87
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,440
centering yourself on

88
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:49,880
breathing as if the place where the inhale

89
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,519
begins or some other place deep in within the

90
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,079
body is the midpoint on the trampoline

91
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,959
is a place where everything

92
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:14,600
settles and you don't have to do the settling as much

93
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,720
as keep a light connection to that

94
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,279
point maybe on the periphery of attention

95
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:37,240
so that the feeling of that be that settle

96
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,120
Point allows things to settle into it allows the rest of your

97
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:50,959
body mind and heart to be

98
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,040
reassured there's a home base on which to

99
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
rest

100
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
for

101
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
for

102
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

103
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

104
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

105
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

106
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

107
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

108
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

109
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,760
for e

110
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,000
there can be an inverse relationship

111
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,039
where the more we are thinking the less were centered and

112
00:19:54,039 --> 00:20:00,880
settled in the body and the less we're

113
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:09,720
thinking the more we're available for the settling into the

114
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:17,480
midpoint the center point of the body the grounding

115
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:27,640
Point shift your priorities from

116
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,400
thinking to

117
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
embodiment

118
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

119
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

120
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

121
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

122
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

123
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

124
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
for for

125
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,279
for

126
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,840
and then as we come to the end of a

127
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:27,240
sitting to perhaps return now settle more

128
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:36,679
on the grounding Point within the settling Point wherever that might be for

129
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:44,320
you maybe it's the place where the exhale

130
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,480
finishes if you let the exhale extend a little bit longer than

131
00:26:51,480 --> 00:27:00,399
usual by letting go more can you in that few extra

132
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:06,000
moments relax and settle deeper into your

133
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:16,880
body and as you inhale have the bottom of this inhale

134
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,158
bottom of the sensations of your body as you breathe

135
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,158
in feel as if it's resting

136
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,559
on that settling

137
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:54,679
point and as if you're grounded or settled or

138
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:59,158
rooted deep inside

139
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:07,480
now bring to mind the daily life the world that

140
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:16,158
you'll be returning to after meditation the people you'll encounter

141
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:23,320
today maybe thinking of the strangers who you'll pass on the

142
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:29,320
street meet in places of Commerce and

143
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:39,559
and to from this subtle place to gaze upon

144
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:47,440
others with appreciation born of a sense of

145
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:54,440
kinship we are all family in some way or other

146
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:07,480
and in this rooted place where no one needs to know what you're

147
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:16,919
doing to wish others well and may it be that this meditation

148
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,519
we do allows us to see and take the

149
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:28,840
time to appreciate others and wish them well

150
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:38,480
may all beings be happy may all beings be

151
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,840
safe may all beings be

152
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,679
peaceful and may all beings be

153
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:57,480
free and may our ability to be settled on ourselves

154
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:04,559
allow us to contribute to the welfare of

155
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:16,319
[Music]

156
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,000
others thank

157
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
you e

158
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:15,919
so hello and on this Monday morning where we begin the second week

159
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,679
on the theme of

160
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:28,760
samama and um last week was more of the preparation for it and this week is

161
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:35,840
still preparation uh sometimes I think of um

162
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:43,840
the Buddhist practice meditation practice especially as being uh kind of a

163
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,120
pyramid where the preparation for meditation or

164
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:58,279
this beginning meditation is um creating the very thick

165
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:04,279
foundation for the pyramid and that the pyramid is

166
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:11,720
represents how much time we spend on different things in meditation and we spend most of the time

167
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:18,960
on setting the foundation and so in a sense we're all beginners we spend a lot of time with

168
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,000
beginning practice and then as we settle

169
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,360
in and the mindfulness gets stronger and the concentration gets [Music]

170
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:36,880
more uh unified then we kind of slowly go uh add

171
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:43,240
higher levels of the pyramid until we maybe occasionally get to near the top

172
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,760
but that's where we spend very little time and um because if you spend too

173
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:54,840
much time on the top of the pyramid it's a little bit like turning the pyramid

174
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:00,440
upside down and uh and have it's standing on a the point and it's not

175
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:07,120
going to be stable then it's going to want to come fall fall and then it'll create a new Foundation once there's a

176
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,799
wide base again so in the teachings of the Buddha

177
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:21,159
the preparation for samadi the mo the the proximate uh

178
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:26,600
preparation for it is to um settle the

179
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:32,000
hindrances the these are five states of

180
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,360
mind that inhibit or block or hinder the settling

181
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,639
and the unification of the whole self into this present

182
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:52,159
moment and um and so somehow learning to settle these or uh not be caught in the

183
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,000
hindrances so they hinder is a big part of being able to go into samade

184
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,080
and so the five hindrances I want to just be very simple I've T taught them

185
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:09,520
before some of you know them well and I want to just give a simple uh

186
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:16,040
label for them uh the first hindrance is to be hindered by

187
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:23,240
desires the second is to be hindered by aversion the third is to be hindered by

188
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:31,878
a sinking amount of energy just kind of like a fading like a draining away of energy or freezing of it the fourth is

189
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:41,440
to be overactivated with too much energy and something and the the fifth is to be

190
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:51,280
confused so I'll talk more about these but for today I want to focus on these first two because uh to to have a better

191
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,760
appreciation about why the hindrances interfere with samade uh you have to appreciate and be

192
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:06,200
able to recognize how each of these hindrances generally puts us into the world of our

193
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:12,599
thinking and this is particular with uh uh desire and aversion there's

194
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:19,960
something that we want or there something we don't want we want to get away from or push away and so there has

195
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:27,000
to be a a cognitive concern of the mind uh a story an idea thoughts an

196
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,920
imagination sitting and meditating their eyes closed we're imagining somehow what it is we

197
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,440
want and so we've gone up into the head into our thoughts ideas

198
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,440
imaginations images that we create that we're swimming in and caught in when

199
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:50,920
there's a strong desire or strong aversion and also as we get pulled into

200
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:56,560
strong desire and strong aversion there's not just a cognitive part of it

201
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:02,280
but there's also a motivational side we get pulled into the motivation behind it

202
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:08,319
there can also be a an emotional side to it that um that it sweeps us into the

203
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:13,400
emotionality or the authority the the

204
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:21,040
the the sense of urgency or power strength of the desire of the

205
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:28,800
aversion and this being pulled into this world that little uh complex of things

206
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,599
associated with desire and aversion uh then it

207
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:42,240
limits the wholeness of attention it limits how we can be what we're aware of

208
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:48,520
caught in a strong desire and um we can hardly notice anything else around us

209
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,720
but the object of our desire uh caught in strong hatred and we

210
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,960
notice nothing really except for the object uh of our

211
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:06,440
hatred and so the attention is now radically limited and the Buddha talked about this

212
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:13,079
that um that greed and aversion is a limitation and we put put us under we

213
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:20,480
put ourselves under severe limitations the stronger those are and one of the ways to feel those limitations is that

214
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,040
uh we're no longer in in touch with the wholeness of who we are we're not really

215
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:33,599
aware of the greater capacities for feeling for emotions for Sensations for

216
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:40,599
embodiment when we're caught in the grip of these strong things and so it's possible to feel when

217
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:46,079
we get caught in the grip of Desire or ver verion how it maybe maybe for some

218
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:52,000
of us pulls us into our head pulls us into our thoughts it uh maybe creates an

219
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,920
activated energy in the body that now uh focuses the energy of the body the

220
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:05,880
activation of the body in a particular area at the expense of really feeling settled or complete or or in the

221
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:13,040
fullness of the body and what we're looking for in um in

222
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,920
samade is a capacity to settle into the whole body to settle down and be rooted

223
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:24,760
and grounded here and so the hindrances are the very thing that gets us

224
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:30,440
ungrounded they can be very compelling and they can be very even desirous to

225
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,359
have them because of the strength of U motivation the Sens of energy and

226
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:43,760
aliveness and Authority they have like they almost can give a life meaning and purpose that uh can feel really good to

227
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:51,520
have like now I know what to do is to hate this people or this thing but it's at a tremendous expense

228
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:58,160
of alienation from oneself being more and more disconnected to Who We Are

229
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:04,640
and samadi is to be connected samade is to be the opposite of alienated from

230
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,520
ourselves but to be deeply connected at home here in

231
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,640
ourselves and so rather than being at war with the hindrances and feel like

232
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:21,520
they're bad to have and good preparation for somebody

233
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:28,800
is to remember everything is to be included everything has a place and so rather than being CAU in the desire and

234
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:36,119
aversion to see it clearly and recognize the effect that has on you recognize how

235
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:42,599
it limits you how it alienates you from parts of yourself and recognize how it

236
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:49,520
uh put you into a very narrow domain of awareness of cognition of concern and so

237
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:56,200
much is being left out um and uh you kind of have blinders on

238
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:02,880
almost and and as you see the limitations of this that is the beginning of opening up to something

239
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:10,400
wider and then you might be easier to uh make room for a settling to feel that

240
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,480
settling place and as we breathe maybe breathe with the hindrances but breathe

241
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,520
from that subtle Place uh let the subtle Place receive the energy the activation

242
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:31,119
the tension of desire and aversion and um and remember that uh the process of

243
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,560
suade especially in the beginning has a lot to do with a

244
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:42,119
settling and uh and the settling point and each of you will have a different

245
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:48,839
settling Point uh grounding Point Place of rooted within in the center of your

246
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:55,720
body perhaps and whatever that might be for you um in Zen sometimes we in Zen

247
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:02,720
you're taught to meditate with your hands one t t on top of the other the thumbs touching like this and sometimes

248
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:11,000
the instructions is not to put your mind in your Hara in your belly but let your heart rest in the in the curve of your

249
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,319
hands the palm of your hands and uh that becomes a settling point for some people

250
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:22,560
it's the sitting bones against their cushion the contact Point uh some people

251
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:29,240
it's something deep in the belly some people it's in the area of the solar plexus or maybe in the

252
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:35,599
heart and some people it's the whole body is the grounding place but uh when

253
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:41,400
you feel settled when something goes ah and you're relaxed uh you've been busy and

254
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:47,000
activated and preoccupied maybe tense or something and then finally you can

255
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,800
stop and something releases and lets go where does that is there some place

256
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,280
in the deeper place of subtleness might feel little bit amorphous might not be as so

257
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:06,680
clear as the clarity of the shoulders relaxing but uh see if you can start

258
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:13,800
finding a a place inside that is the Gathering Place the settling place and

259
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:19,960
be careful with it don't focus on it directly don't zero in that laser focus

260
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,839
on it almost like you have like more like a peripheral attention to it a

261
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:32,880
gentle soft attention into it a as if that is what allows it to kind

262
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,119
of smile allows it to grow allows her to feel

263
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:43,160
safe and um

264
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,000
so practicing with the hindrances is invaluable part of this Foundation the

265
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,240
foundational part of the pyramid that we're bu building and so if you have if

266
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:03,319
you have maybe you might have occasionally today some of the hindrances of desire and aversion

267
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:09,000
don't see them as exactly as unfortunate and be aversive to

268
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,400
them see them oh this is an opportunity now to practice with the foundational

269
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:21,559
elements of of samadi and as I've said one of the key

270
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:28,280
things to do is to notice how these hindrances now for today

271
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:36,040
um U aversion and desire how they limit you how they narrow the focus the

272
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:42,000
attention that's where attention can go how they contract you how they uh keep

273
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,040
you caught and uh and how so much more of who you are the totality the all your

274
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,079
capacities for uh as a human being many of them are left out now and left behind

275
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:02,119
and so is your way in which you're aware of the your environment it's very significant to see

276
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:09,680
the effect of the hindrances and know them well this is what's going to have help

277
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:16,520
uh the whole complex of the hindrances to settle and to return so you can

278
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:25,240
return to the the settled point the settling place the grounding place

279
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:34,960
within so um so today uh please uh uh notice when you

280
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:41,160
get caught and the language is caught in desire and aversion and notice how it

281
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:46,480
limits you and if you just do that in the course of the day you're uh you're

282
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,640
doing really well and it'll really supports this laying down the foundation for the where we're going in this course

283
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:59,079
on somebody so thank you very much and um I

284
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:04,440
look forward to tomorrow with you
