1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:07,680
uh well welcome back and good morning my name is May Elliott and here we are on

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,940
our last day of a week-long study on the foundations of vipassana meditation

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,939
so today's instructions are on open awareness up to now this week we've

4
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:29,519
covered a couple of different areas of our experience to pay attention to breathing Body Sensations emotions and

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:37,260
thoughts and today is when we bring these four different aspects of meditation into a seamless whole

6
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,800
so this is the culmination of the work we've done so far so far we've seen we've seen that we can

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,640
be mindful of any of these parts of experience and today we see how they can be unified together

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,039
so um so let's begin our meditation

9
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:03,378
go ahead and connect your meditation posture

10
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,020
posture that invites ease and well-being

11
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:28,640
that's both energetic ready to meet the moment and relaxed

12
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,479
sitting with a soft forehead relaxed temples

13
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,280
or released the jaw

14
00:01:52,399 --> 00:02:00,258
relaxed shoulders and a softened belly

15
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,220
as we begin to sit we can connect with our primary anchor

16
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:38,280
that might be the breath The Sound State or maybe a global sense of the bodily

17
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:45,780
posture for the sake of Simplicity we'll focus

18
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,620
on the breath

19
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,140
for this first part of the meditation just being loyal to the breath

20
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:19,940
connecting with where you feel it predominantly and staying connected to it

21
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,680
so I'm using all preoccupation

22
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,440
foreign

23
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:26,369

24

foreign

25
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,220
starts

26
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,399
[Music]

27
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:45,080
feeling it for its full length noticing the moment the inhale ends

28
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,479
and the shift to Exhale

29
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,660
noticing the whole length of the exhale and the moment the

30
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,100
exhale stops

31
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:14,479
making contact with each transition or inhale to Exhale and Back Again

32
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,639
thank you

33
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,000
thank you

34
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,900
thank you

35
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,720
foreign

36
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,720
foreign

37
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,399
begins to settle on the breath foreign

38
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,140
at any given moment there are lots of things happening sounds

39
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,899
Sensations emotions

40
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:45,860
moves thoughts

41
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:53,360
so the way that will include these so begin to openly awareness is it

42
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:02,040
rather than focusing solely on the breath if one of these other aspects of

43
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,040
experience becomes predominant will allow the attention to go to that new

44
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,440
experience and to heal it fully to get to know what

45
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:21,320
it feels like in the body in the heart and mind in the present moment

46
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:28,680
[Music] so you still have a

47
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,779
my preference for the breath and that that's where our our home is we keep

48
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:38,880
coming back to the breath in between the objects that we notice

49
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:45,720
that will venture out to different Sensations feel them for a bit if they're predominant then come back to

50
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,880
the breath an emotion arises

51
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:58,560
you go feel that emotion connect with it explore feel it when it's no longer

52
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,220
predominant come back to the breath foreign

53
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,330
[Music]

54
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:26,220
capacity for attention functions a little like a spotlight It Shines on one

55
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,920
thing at a time [Music]

56
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,200
so with this practice we're allowing whatever is predominant to be in the spotlight

57
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,490
foreign [Music]

58
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:27,240
foreign practice can be particularly supportive

59
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:34,440
for this style of meditation [Music]

60
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,800
making a soft note in the mind and

61
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:46,700
inhale exhale

62
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:56,060

63
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:02,579

foreign

71
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,940
we're taking note of anything that arises

72
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,860
and then returning to the breath

73
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,699
foreign

74
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,140

75
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:24,650

foreign

77
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:40,620
foreign meditation [Music]

78
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:47,580
so let go of our preference for the breath let go of

79
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,980
the practice of continuing to return to the breath in between phenomena

80
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,700
the math will sit with a full open awareness

81
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:05,520
so in this style of practice we're meeting whatever it is the

82
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,400
spotlight of awareness Falls on

83
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,960
maybe it's pressure cleaning the chest

84
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,980
we feel that for a few moments and then

85
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:36,080
the sensations of relaxation in the belly become predominant foreign

86
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,679
then tingling in the neck in the legs

87
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:11,179
then a hot you might not thinking

88
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,940
even an emotion

89
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:34,500
in this way we keep meeting whatever arises the breath might be something that comes

90
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:42,539
into predominance and we note it but we're not intentionally returning to the breath as our primary

91
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:49,200
anchor you could think of this as an anchorless

92
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,919
practice

93
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:01,799
we're allowing the attention to move from one object to another to another

94
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:10,080
not trying to control an environment just enjoying receptive attention

95
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,100
receiving whatever appears in awareness

wanders off you can try we only went into the practice by asking

100
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,480

101
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,500

as we come to the quotes of our meditation you can take a moment to connect with

114
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,679
the goodness of this practice

115
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:41,120
regardless of how we think our meditation went

116
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:47,960
just the intention to sit down and make an effort

117
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:56,840
to have the body be still so wholesome so onward feeding

118

foreign

120
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:46,020
[Music] I feel so blessed to get to have another

121
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:51,179
day with this this super sweet songa that's really

122
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:59,880
been a joy getting to sit with you um so uh here we are uh the focus of

123
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:06,200
today's instruction our last day covering the foundations of opposana

124
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:13,260
these basics and uh we're looking at open awareness we're practicing open awareness

125
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:19,500
sometimes called choiceless attention because we're not intentionally choosing

126
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:25,260
our object of meditation we're choiceless in that we're allowing

127
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:33,600
whatever is most predominant to be the next object the next object of attention and this practice of open awareness or

128
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,120
choiceless attention is what's at the heart of mahasi sayadas meditation

129
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,659
instruction the Burmese master who had so much influence over Insight in the

130
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:51,779
West uh so today I'd like to review what we've done so far this week as it

131
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:59,399
pertains to this open awareness practice and then we'll shift to talk about styles of practice and when when do we

132
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:04,559
focus just on the breadth versus when do we sit with open awareness and how to

133
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:11,399
discern when to do what so hopefully by the end of this morning you'll have a better sense of what practice is best

134
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:17,299
for whatever mind you happen to have at a given moment that you sit down to meditate

135
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:23,539
so let's start with a review of Where we've been and how this comes together into open awareness practice

136
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:28,919
so the way this works is we start by developing my photos of breathing

137
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:34,440
the breath becomes our primary anchor the anchor is where we've been directing

138
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:40,320
our attention back to bringing our attention back from the mind wanders at

139
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,159
that time in the practice if something else drew our attention we would return to the breath right away we wouldn't

140
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:54,480
focus on it just just go back to the bottom and that's what we did on Monday day one of the instruction focusing on

141
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,899
breath then the next day we added more objects to our meditation we added physical Association

142
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:07,080
Sensations and we learned that if a physical sensation one is more predominant than the bread we could

143
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:13,500
shift our attention to that new sensation we actually were to hang out with it we would feel it we give it our

144
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:20,519
full attention until it leaves it uh no longer was predominant and then we'd

145
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:26,460
return to the breath and in that way we learned the symptoms of the language of the body and we're

146
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:32,299
going to feel the many different types of Sensations that can be helped

147
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:37,320
then we focused on how to integrate emotions and thoughts into our

148
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,659
meditation learning that if an emotion became predominant we could turn our attention

149
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:49,019
away from the breath to the emotion recognizing it allowing it feeling it

150
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:54,299
teasing apart what we were noticing and then when the emotion faded we could

151
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:59,880
return to the breath I'm studying thoughts if a thought

152
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:06,539
became predominant we could turn our attention to the process of thinking not the content of the thinking not not

153
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:13,800
getting lost in The Narrative of the thinking that seeing the process noticing our thoughts as present moment

154
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:19,200
phenomena and then returning to the breath come on

155
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,679
so today as I mentioned we're learning to integrate them into a seamless hole

156
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,800
so rather than directing attention to the breath or to any specific object on

157
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,378
the last day hear me practice with receptive attention receptive as opposed

158
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:44,580
to directed attention we open up our awareness and allow anything that arises physical Sensations

159
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:51,540
emotions thoughts to be known and we're doing that without preference

160
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:58,680
um in a way learning how to be mindful of each of these parts of experience black

161
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,380
body emotions and thoughts it's a little like learning to make a suit

162
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:11,160
each day we've learned how to chop one kind of vegetable right like day one we chopped onions stay tuned we chopped

163
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:18,060
carrots day three we chopped zucchini Etc but today we put it all together in a

164
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:24,480
pot and we made and when we dip the spoon in our soup we pay attention to whatever

165
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,480
vegetable floats onto our spoon we taste that vegetable and then we see

166
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,500
what floats onto the spoon next we don't go fishing for a particular vegetable we just pay attention to

167
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,720
whatever vegetable floats onto the spoon next [Music]

168
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,780
in essence I whole body and mind is the soup and the vegetables are the different

169
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:54,560
experiences of breath body emotions and thoughts our awareness is the spirit

170
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,579
whatever whatever experience appears in our awareness whatever floats on the

171
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:05,339
spoon is what we're giving our attention to so in doing this we're not controlling

172
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:11,460
we're receptive we're relaxed we're not choosing a specific object

173
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:17,660
just allowing what's in the foreground to be experienced

174
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:25,560
as I as I explained in the guided meditation in this practice and this was at the end

175
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:31,020
of The Meditation we dropped our preference for the breath we're equally

176
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:39,000
interested in taking any predominant experience as our object of mindfulness in the open awareness practice

177
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:47,640
um and at any given moment there are lots of things happening Sensations bodies Body Sensations sounds Etc

178
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:53,339
um and as I shared in the meditation our capacity for attention functions a

179
00:36:53,339 --> 00:37:01,500
little like a spotlight you know it shines at one uh on one thing at a time so choiceless attention we allow

180
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:08,460
whatever is the most dominant sensation to be in the spotlight and as soon as something else becomes predominant we

181
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:15,359
allow that to be in the spot of my arm and the challenge with this practice is

182
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,460
is staying attentive enough

183
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:28,440
and then the Mind needs to be pretty pretty settled in order to stay with changing objects I'd say that's the

184
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:34,200
primary challenge of the open awareness practice um if the mind isn't settled when it

185
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,960
makes contact with an object say a sound an emotion a body sensation it will

186
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:45,119
provide commentary so when a bird chirps if we if the attention isn't consistent

187
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,579
or it isn't grounded enough uh rather than just being the sound of

188
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:56,700
the bird chirping the Mind might say like oh that sounds a hummingbird or oh

189
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:03,599
I love hummingbirds I should get a hummingbird feeder oh but that might attract squirrels and do what the Mind

190
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,780
does but so the mind has to be relatively stable in order to stay with each object and not get lost in the

191
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:16,740
commentary about each object one thing that can be supportive with

192
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:23,820
staying with the object as we've mentioned each day this week is using noting practice so it's making that

193
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:29,099
light mental note in the mind where ninety percent of the attention is on

194
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:36,240
the sensation or the sound or the emotion um and maybe just a 10 there's just a

195
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,540
little attention denoting what's happening um and when we're sufficiently present

196
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:48,300
when we notice a bird chirping outside rather than falling into commentary

197
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:54,240
about it we might just know hearing and the way this open awareness practice

198
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,119
might look as we note hearing and we hear it for a while noticing what

199
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:06,720
it sounds like and then we might notice a tightness in the neck and note tightness

200
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:14,460
feeling the tightness and then a thought comes in oh I hope my neck spasms don't start up

201
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:21,660
again then you might know thinking at which point you notice an emotion and

202
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:27,359
note anxiety then you might notice an intention to

203
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:34,500
relax and intended then relaxation happens in the shoulders

204
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:39,720
and so you know relax it and maybe it stays for a long time and so you note a

205
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,640
few times relaxing relaxing

206
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,640
relaxing calm

207
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:56,460
and then a thought arrives wow this meditation thing is really working and

208
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:02,220
we might know surprise you might think then I'm getting pretty

209
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:07,680
good at this and then we might note Pride

210
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,099
then an emotion comes in and you note embarrassment

211
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:20,839
then some warmth in the face and you might know warmth

212
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:26,099
etc etc so this this is one way that it might

213
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:33,000
look and notice we're not taking anything that we notice we're not taking it personally it's like oh just a clean

214
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,599
clear awareness now this is embarrassment this is pride

215
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:45,060
and uh you may have noticed that those were some pretty uh specific

216
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:49,160
ways of knowing experience

217
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:56,160
Pride embarrassment [Music] um intending

218
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,740
Etc so it's okay if you don't have the perfect note for what it is that you're

219
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:09,180
experiencing so if you're not sure that it's I don't know if it doesn't stand out oh this is an intention or this is

220
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:15,060
um this is planning you might guess not thinking or you might just note emotion

221
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:22,200
you don't have to strain to to try to find the right name for what it is that you're experiencing

222
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,560
for a long time when I was growing up I would sometimes say or do something

223
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:32,760
and then I would have this feeling afterwards and I wouldn't know what it

224
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:39,540
was all that I could do to describe it was to say I feel bad

225
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:47,160
I feel bad because how it felt inside and it took me a long time to realize

226
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:54,540
that that feeling was called guilt um but for the sake of this practice it

227
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:59,960
would have been sufficient just to note healing back

228
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:08,520
going back [Music] um and so having that

229
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:13,740
um you know if if the recognition for the name isn't there that's fine the

230
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,839
main thing is just being present and noticing what's happening

231
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:24,119
um even if you don't have the name for it the way that the noting functions is

232
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:30,720
it really just gives the Mind something to do to stay engaged so we're just giving it something that's present

233
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:37,619
centered to pay attention to [Music] and if you make a note every few seconds

234
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:42,859
that will be enough to help you stay connected the pacing is hit

235
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:48,180
relaxed and gentle and spacious you don't have to make a note every

236
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:55,039
millisecond so this might sound something like hearing

237
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,040
inhale

238
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,440
Etc [Music]

239
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,119
so that's a summary of open awareness practice

240
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:30,300
and how loading can support us in it um I'd like to shift now to a question

241
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:35,520
um when do we do this open awareness practice is this what I should be doing

242
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,800
all the time in my meditation well it depends on the person but for a

243
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,079
lot of people the answer is no this practice is best instead for when the

244
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:54,980
mind is somewhat stable and steady not when there's a lot of dispersive thought a lot of of uh

245
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:02,220
so if the mind is really slippery and unwilling to stay with an object and you notice yourself getting really lost and

246
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:09,480
thought just go back to breath practice this open awareness practice might be too wide of a pasture for the mind to

247
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:15,000
play in at that given moment so instead just let the Mind focus on

248
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,880
the breath the breath is is a smaller playing field where it can be put on a

249
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,400
leash so when the mind is dispersive we just have it focused on a simple object go

250
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:32,940
back to the breath only go back to the primary answer so this is directed attention and the simple object of

251
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,220
breathing as this stabilizes OAS it settles the

252
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:43,500
mind Once the mind is a little more steady

253
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:49,200
and present then you might start allowing in other objects and try this open awareness

254
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:55,560
practice when the mind is more stable that's when you can allow it to go off leash and

255
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:01,740
have a wider pasture again that's when you can most effectively practice with the open awareness

256
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:08,040
so another way we can think about these two ways of practicing is through the analogy of a camera aperture so when we

257
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:13,859
focus on the breath the awareness has a small narrow aperture we're just looking

258
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:19,740
at the breath when we sit with open awareness we're allowing anything to come into our field

259
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:24,960
and this is like having a very wide aperture open awareness

260
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:31,140
so if the mind is wild and there's lots of the Concha we go to the primary anchor we hang out with the breath

261
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:36,900
smaller aperture and then when we stabilize the mind is more quiet

262
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:43,619
we have a wide open app and shirt aperture open awareness I'd like to think about this as as two ends of a

263
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:51,140
spectrum narrow to wide on breath only to open awareness

264
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:56,819
now I'd like to provide a middle ground for you in between these two practices

265
00:45:56,819 --> 00:46:02,940
on either end of the spectrum and this is what we did in the middle of the meditation today

266
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:11,040
um and what an adaptation share is what I often do in my personal practice as it's both stabilizing and it's inclusive

267
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:18,660
of all experience and this is a lot like what we've done each day in our meditation so here's

268
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:26,760
here's what I do I start my meditation by spending some time with just the breath to stabilize and collect the mind

269
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:33,660
then as the Mind settles a bit if something else becomes more predominant I allow the attention to move to that

270
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:39,599
new object I contacted we get to know it and that can be any of the things that we've covered this week's Body

271
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:46,859
Sensations emotions thoughts Etc and then when it's no longer compelling I come back to the breath and

272
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:52,920
that's the key piece here is the breath is the home so in this way we're still

273
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,500
being with the breathing so it's stabilizing the mind

274
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:05,220
um only difference is that open awareness doesn't have any preference for a particular anchor so with full

275
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:10,619
open awareness it doesn't favor the breath as the landing path but I'm sharing now this kind of middle ground

276
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:17,579
in between um the narrow aperture of breath and the wide aperture of open awareness in this

277
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:24,060
Middle Ground we still have a preference for the breath we're still coming back to it so that stabilizes us and at the

278
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:30,780
same time we're being inclusive of anything that arises because we're allowing ourselves to venture out to

279
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:36,180
feeling so so I'll uh just give you an example I'm

280
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:41,220
saying uh the analogy of a hand here so we can imagine that the if the breath is

281
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:46,880
our home that's the Palm here and then each finger is negative Body Sensations

282
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,440
emotions thoughts um so we're focusing on the breath when

283
00:47:52,440 --> 00:48:00,140
a body sensation becomes predominant if you go and feel the body sensation then we come back to the breath

284
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:09,599
then we come back to the bed not getting caught in the content of the thought just noticing the process and we're back

285
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:17,359
with the breath an emotion breath body sensation breath Etc

286
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:22,619
um so hope so hopefully that gives you a sense of something that you can do when

287
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:29,400
the mind is starting to settle but full open awareness practice where there's no preference for an anchor might be a

288
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:34,859
little too um a little too expansive the mind's too

289
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:40,099
likely to get lost in things it's not quite stabilizing enough

290
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:45,660
so um maybe just a few last words about open awareness practice

291
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:51,900
remember that it's sitting with a receptive mind it's uh it should be easy it should be

292
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:57,540
kind of again unnaturalness to it and I'm just receiving

293
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:04,440
and one of the impacts of it is that it allows us to see a knee chat and permanence the inconsistency of things

294
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:10,619
and we get to see kata's practice of just seeing what arises next next we get

295
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:17,280
to see the arising and passing of all phenomena and when we sit in this way it's as if

296
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:25,338
the whole world comes to us so I will close with a quote

297
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:32,540
the type for its Master ajan cha he says

298
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:38,640
just go into the room and put one chair in the center

299
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,520
take the seat in the center of the room open the doors and windows and see who

300
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:50,579
comes to visit you will witness all kinds of scenes and actors

301
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:57,780
all kinds of Temptation and stories imaginable your job is to stay in your seat

302
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:03,359
you will see it all arise and pass and out of this wisdom and understanding

303
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:10,260
will come as I see it the mind is like a single point the center of the universe

304
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:18,060
and mental states are like visitors who come to stay at this point for short or long periods of time get to know these

305
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:24,780
visitors well become familiar with the vivid pictures they paint the alluring stories they

306
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:30,359
tell to entice you to follow them but do not give up your seat it is the

307
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:36,020
only chair around if you continue to occupy it unceasingly

308
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:42,440
greeting each guest as it comes firmly establishing your yourself and awareness

309
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:49,380
transforming your mind into the one who knows the one who is awake the visitors

310
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:55,859
will eventually stop coming back if you give them real attention how many

311
00:50:55,859 --> 00:51:01,319
