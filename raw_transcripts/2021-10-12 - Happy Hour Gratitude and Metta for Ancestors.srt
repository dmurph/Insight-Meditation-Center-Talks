so hello everyone hello and welcome to happy hour wherever in the world you are

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,280

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,439
thanksgiving day in canada as um kim just shared with us and also being

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,720
indigenous people today uh in the united states

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,560
the theme i'd like to invite us to to engage with

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,920
is um as as of course i'll introduce it in the guided meditation so

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,239
those who are new [Music] whatever you need to know will be shared with you in the guided meditation just

8
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:51,199
relax and and let let arise whatever needs to

9
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:58,399
arise so so the theme

10
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,878
is one of um gratitude and metta for

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,360
for ancestors for those who have come before us

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,040
you know we might have known some of our ancestors who might have known our

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,400
parents um maybe we knew our grandparents

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,840
maybe we heard of our great grandparents maybe not but these are people just like

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,640
us who walked the earth and had challenges

16
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,240
had hopes had dreams

17
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,600
and we are

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,880
this being who is us in this moment this being who is us

19
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,040
represents their hopes and dreams for the future

20
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,960
they may not have envisioned us or known us but maybe they thought

21
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,640
you know if we go so many generations back sense of

22
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,840
sending to the future the best of them the best they were able to give the best

23
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,720
they were able to offer um [Music] so

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,959
a theme of meta gratitude um

25
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,800
and with i don't want to get too heady about it because i don't want to talk too much about it

26
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:40,560
it's talking too much because might feel a little overwhelming but for us to just settle in as always into our bodies

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,760
with our breath in this moment and then i'll have some invitations and see what

28
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,920
comes up see what what you might get in touch with which may not have been

29
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,599
present before may not have been aware of before and what might bring up

30
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,040
a sense of connection and aliveness and brightness

31
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:11,280
spark in your heart and heart and mind so so let's explore

32
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,720
together let's be curious see what comes up we let's have humility

33
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,319

because i am feeling sad i don't have a whole train of ancestors i know about

234
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:50,400
my parents put them down we only saw them in distant pictures it was kind of grim and yet i remembered my mother used

235
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:58,319
to talk about an ancestor who came across the country to california in a conestoga covered wagon and she always

236
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:03,760
talked about this person didn't norris i thought what the heck that's going to be an ancestor i know

237
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,520
nothing about her what you're talking about their life must have been what kind of cultural conditions it must have

238
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,640
been so now i have an ancestor to appreciate that's great

239
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,319
thanks dave yeah thank you for that and i have to say also for me as i was practicing you

240
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:26,640
know there are so many of my ancestors i don't know and i just imagine oh yeah that person must have had a father and

241
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,000
mother i'm like hey what come in i don't even know your names welcome welcome

242
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,079

243
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:44,160
human beings of course we have ancestors mark please well

244
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,200
i used to my mother

245
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,880
uh i moved to the west coast and she was still on the east coast where

246
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,319
where i grew up and i tried to visit uh four times a year i

247
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:06,160
made it at least three anyway and and would stay for a week to visit and

248
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:12,560
about 13 years ago i went for one of these visits and you know flew in

249
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:20,160
and got there pretty late at night and rang the bell and and she met me and uh

250
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:26,079
we went into the living room man and hugged and

251
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:31,920
she just it was one of those hugs where it was she was just

252
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:38,160
pulling me inside of her and she said oh i i just love you so much

253
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,160
and it wasn't that she'd have never said that before but not often it was just

254
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,680
one of those rare rare moments of just pulling you inside

255
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,839
and and so we had to visit which which was fine and great and i went back

256
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:01,760
to the west coast and and two weeks later i got a call

257
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,520
and she had a stroking and she died and i was just so

258

crowded room all of us bringing our ancestors and each other's ancestors too

271
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:37,040
and just acknowledging that we all were all descended we're all descendants from

272
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:43,520
all these human beings who as one of you wrote in your note is is um

273
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:52,240
recognizing that they probably did the best they could recognizing they did the best they could so so with this i'm

274
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:59,359
opening the rooms take care of yourselves take care of each other here we go

275

279
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,880
i'll do it thanks nikki i appreciate it being part of the group and and uh it was very uh sticky a little bit

280
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,560
uncomfortable i i knew this day would come we would talk i'd be in a meditation group and that it

281
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:53,680
would be talking about ancestors and uh my ancestors are you know i have ancestors through um you know in america

282
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:59,119
for like eight generations and they were involved in everything epic battles you

283
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:05,280
know and you know uh building fortunes and and unfortunately all the bad things

284
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:12,319
they were involved into that so my point was that i'm gonna try not to romanticize

285
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:18,880
their actions and just kind of focus on well they had a lot of strength they certainly had strength and determination

286
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,240
and i i'm sure i got some of that you know i could i've had my own successes but

287
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:31,599
you know um anyhow that was that was the point that i wanted to make yeah thank you so much nick thank you for bringing

288
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:37,760
that in yes absolutely not to romanticize our ancestors

289
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:44,400
we're wonderful beautiful and flawed people just like us they're a mixed bag

290
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,680
just like we are and they had good intentions

291
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:57,119
in in the way they saw their intentions and complicated especially with the history

292
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:03,119
and who knows maybe history will look back at and say well yep they had good intentions and they really messed up in

293
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,160
these ways they messed up the environment and so

294
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:15,680
so to appreciate both it's a both end it's a both and to appreciate their goodness and given what they knew they

295
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:22,000
did the best they could and yeah they were flawed in many ways and so are we so

296
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:29,040
yes and all of that all of that appreciating all of that yeah so thank you nick so important to

00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:36,079
bring that and really appreciate you bringing that in yeah so dear ones the time has come it's
