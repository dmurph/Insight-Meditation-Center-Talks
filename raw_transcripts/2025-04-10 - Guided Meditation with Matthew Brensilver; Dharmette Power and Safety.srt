00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,320
so uh so welcome folks welcome to you all

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:21,039
um yeah uh good to uh good to be with you

3
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,160
i trust you all have some way of practicing and are not relying on my

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,920
instructions for that purpose you know I'm sort of like ornamental you know on

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,320
the base layer of your practice should have said that like 15 years

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:48,519
ago but um let us uh let us sit

7
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,759
So relaxing uh whatever can be relaxed everything that

8
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:45,000
can be relaxed we relax whatever tension

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,240
remains we give a complete blessing to remain yeah

10
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,640
and if anything's tight or hurts in your

11
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:10,280
body just remaining in the flow of meditation but uh go ahead and

12
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:19,080
uh gently massage wherever there's tightness pain

13
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,920
sense the way that uh

14
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,280
kindness it's manifest in that

15
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:59,400
gesture certain expression of uh loving kindness

16
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,960
i'm just feeling the transmission of that uh

17
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,918
care perhaps from your hand to your body

18
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:54,520
find oursel in this uh lineage of love and care

19
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,400
same gesture of

20
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,880
kindness manifested a million ways a million

21
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,840
times over uh millennia

22
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,840
the wish to be free of suffering is the kind of

23
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:01,360
uh animating theme of history it's just that

24
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,919
uh generally people don't understand happiness well

25
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:25,000
enough that we're learning here on our cushions our

26
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,240
seats our

27
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:45,120
beds learning about our nervous system and about uh this realm of

28
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,319
experience some

29
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,639
sorrow learning about what's worthy of our reverence and

30
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,960
protection where we can let go

31
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:07,639
our worries will not stop until we stop

32
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,879
so we sense into the flow of breathing but something in

33
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:29,120
us stops

34
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,480
instinctively we place so much

35
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,920
hope to a Future that never exactly comes

36
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:56,320
So we renounce

37
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:03,279
the protection and acquisitiveness

38
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,040
ownership the control

39
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:25,279
we refine our relationship with

40
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:33,480
helplessness and in this way cultivate our power

41
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,240
our attention is usually a kind of appendage

42
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,360
of our wanting and our fear

43
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,959
but we can't uh fool mother nature

44
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,199
we have to let

45
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,040
go to uh receive this moment

46
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:09,840
and when it um those times it doesn't work maybe

47
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,480
nothing

48
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:21,760
works actually get to uh see what we were trying to

49
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,039
do and

50
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,440
manufacture it's okay

51
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,559
maybe we can say in any given moment insight

52
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:12,440
into one of the four noble truths is on offer

53
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,080
we just do our best not to miss it

54
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,890
[Music]

55
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:19,360
okay it's good to uh to sit with

56
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:25,480
you um so uh no

57
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,520
um no class next week i'll be away but

58
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,279
um back on the

59
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:40,919
23rd so

60
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,760
uh several several years ago uh following a kind of you know episode of

61
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:58,960
some some harm you know kind of like unethical leadership uh some insight teachers were asked to

62
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,600
say something about CILA ethical conduct and

63
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,760
um uh to write a short thing and um uh

64
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:18,080
Kitty Sarro um was uh also known as Tanniser's husband

65
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:25,840
it's not all he is meditation teacher road scholar whatnot anyway but also

66
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:33,039
Tannisra's husband um wrote this and I I condensed it slightly but um uh has

67
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:40,799
stayed with me over these years so um wrote um after a meal on it was

68
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:50,480
this is in the you know 70s uh late 70s or early 80s I believe and

69
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,840
um as a as a monk in the Thai forest tradition so he says after a meal

70
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,200
offering in rural northeast Thailand I was sitting with Ajin Sha and a group of

71
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,880
young western monks from several different countries he told us that one day we'd all be

72
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:13,520
teachers bringing the dharma back to our own countries he warned us quote "Don't be

73
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,559
the kind of teacher that gets so puffed up you can't get through the door don't

74
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,279
go around thinking I'm a teacher." Always remember you're a

75
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:31,039
practitioner if a situation arises that calls for teaching let teaching happen

76
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:40,200
it comes and goes in your heart you are a practitioner mindful and

77
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:46,519
empty ajenta was warning us about the dangers of being inflated and

78
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:52,880
intoxicated by the power and prestige of

79
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,519
the leadership position we are regularly reminded that the

80
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:05,440
blessings do not belong to us that we are riding on the perfection and power

81
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:11,360
of the awakened one as our practice of the path deepens we'll naturally grow in

82
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:19,120
personal power cultivating sila samadei pa plugging into the measureless merit

83
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,600
of the triple gem we potentize our actions for good or for ill it's vital

84
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,960
to be interested in and sensitive to our impact on the world and those around

85
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:39,039
us we must regularly ask ourselves are we doing harm because we have ignorance

86
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,640
we must open ourselves to the feedback uh using the SA to help us see where we

87
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,640
do unconscious harm to our community being a dharma teacher or a dedicated

88
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:58,600
Buddhist practitioner we are waving the banner of the awakened one representing that

89
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,440
extraordinary heritage partaking of that trustworthy

90
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,240
power and prestige when one has power one's

91
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:20,080
wholesome actions are amplified but so are the unh wholesome ones everything we do has more impact we

92
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:28,518
have the potential to do great good and also great harm

93
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:42,080
so just the image of that uh that scene kind of touched me you know Ajent Sha

94
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:50,480
this kind of revered figure back then revered and kind of legacy only grown

95
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:58,760
but sitting around and Ajin Sha foreseeing the spread of the dharma

96
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:07,120
uh and I'm very curious who was there what people were there uh Jack Kornfield

97
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:14,800
over overlapped I believe for some years there and uh I'm curious where they went

98
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:21,720
and what goodness their lives have

99
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:27,878
brought and it's likely that my life

100
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:37,919
somehow is tied to that moment after that meal offering maybe 50

101
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:45,358
years ago and that means of course in some way

102
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:55,158
you're you know tied to that moment too and that moves me you know the ways

103
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:02,560
that goodness ripples ripples in in a manner that's

104
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:09,839
hard to anticipate and imagine to be feeling the blessings just

105
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:17,960
kind of reverberating down through the uh decades

106
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,280
it says if a situation arises that calls for teaching let teaching happen it comes and

107
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,800
goes you know it's like identification with our roles imagining that we are

108
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:35,400
actors not roles it's insidious the ego is

109
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,640
insidious not an enemy but insidious

110
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:48,680
and especially when there are things that we love at stake have to be very

111
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:57,440
awake in the Thai forest tradition um a a a dhamma talk must be requested i

112
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:05,839
think it's usually a very junior you know monastic sometimes anagorica something like uh asking

113
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:12,000
formally for the talk meaning that a talk is only ever a

114
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,280
response to a need not a product

115
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,440
it means that the dharma is

116
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,640
always shared

117
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,760
consensually that the teacher only exists because a student exists

118
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:41,520
otherwise she would not exist and this ensures that the teacher speaks

119
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:48,320
into a kind of field of sincerity that the dharma is transmitted

120
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,400
from warm hand to warm hand

121
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:03,560
the blessings of the path um do not belong to us and

122
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:10,839
uh you cannot own goodness the dharma just like a

123
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:17,320
people is un unpossessible you know

124
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:25,520
and ownership is really a kind of core egoic

125
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:33,280
fantasy and part of a dharma life of living a dharma centric life is living a

126
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,359
life amidst the kind of felt sense of

127
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:49,000
unpossessibility because um the ego is always trying to exert

128
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:56,440
power we talk often about surrender the dissolution of willfulness we talk about

129
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:05,000
vulnerability and softening and suppleness yeah that's all necessary

130
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,680
we don't talk about it in this lineage but I had a mentor in the in the Tibetan

131
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,920
lineage and um they're always talking about

132
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,400
power the path cultivates power wisdom

133
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:29,520
is power love is power cultivating sila samadei pa

134
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,320
plugging into the measureless merit of the triple gem we potentize our

135
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:42,400
actions actions become more potent more good more

136
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:50,359
ill and the more powerful one becomes on this path the more force one is

137
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:58,960
marshalling and that cuts both ways the power to heal and to harm right that's

138
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,240
sometimes like saying in medicine like anything potent enough to heal is potent

139
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:12,800
enough to to harm to have side effects right and as practitioners we become

140
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:18,920
interested in acrewing power in so far as it helps us alleviate

141
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,359
suffering our own that of others

142
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:32,119
and the more powerful I become through my own practice through my own

143
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:39,119
maturation the more seriously you will take me when I say something

144
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:47,599
like be kind with yourself or it's safe to let go or a

145
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,320
million other things

146
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,960
but there's another part of me that doesn't want power or attention at all

147
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,359
like once the student is gone the teacher

148
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:10,880
dissolves and Kisara goes on to to speak about

149
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,599
sila sila as a protection we do our best to follow the principles

150
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,800
of nonharming but we in a sense can never

151
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,280
have a completely lucid view of ourselves there's some measure of

152
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,400
unconsciousness and so we rely on others to harmonize our

153
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:39,079
understanding of our intentions and our effects our

154
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:46,200
impacts and we we become more and more

155
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,599
calibrated you know our intentions impacts those are kind of like more

156
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,960
tightly coupled but we can never be sure and the

157
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:05,119
open loops of feedback are essential for communal safety that's how SA stays

158
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:12,560
well we're waving the banner of the awakened

159
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,760
one representing that extraordinary heritage partaking in the

160
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:24,560
trustworthy power prestige that's big those are big words

161
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:32,240
i like those words um yeah partaking partaking in the the

162
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,359
trustworthy power and prestige we want to be worthy of that

163
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:46,560
banner and we do our best to it's not emulating something we do

165
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:59,880
