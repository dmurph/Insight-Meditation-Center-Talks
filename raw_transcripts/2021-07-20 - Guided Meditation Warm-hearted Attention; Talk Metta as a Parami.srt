1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,080
with a warm welcome good evening good evening

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:16,800
thank you for letting me know that there was no sound

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:25,359
we're all in this together i think that you can yes okay good

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,960
you can hear now

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,120
so to begin our guided meditation

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:45,840
just to sit and know we're sitting

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,358
feeling the pressure of the chair or cushion against the body

8
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:27,840
feeling connected here

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,439
and checking in with the sound [Laughter] check it in you can check it with the

10
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:54,000
sound or with the body

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,040
is there a way that the body might feel a little bit more balanced or

12
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:09,920
connected or here is there a warm-hearted gentle

13
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,640
way in which you can just finish arriving

14
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,840
in this moment

15
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,840
and it might be that there are areas in the body that have some tension some tightness

16
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:19,680
can we bring a warm-hearted awareness to those areas

17
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,519
some caring attention

18
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,879
whether it's a knee or a back

19
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:47,840
or maybe just tension in the shoulders around the eyes or in the jaw

20
00:03:51,360 --> 00:04:01,840
can we allow it to be there

21
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:09,120
so often we have aversion to these uncomfortable experiences of

22
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:17,919
course we do we explore and experiment

23
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:25,360
what is it like if we don't have the aversion to uncomfortable bodily

24
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
experiences

25
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:43,840
can we greet them hello you again

26
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:28,000
bring in that same warm-hearted attention to the sensations of breathing

27
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,589
feeling the expansion contraction [Music]

28
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,039
that goes with inhales and

29
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
exhales

30
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,280
and when the mind wanders

31
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,440
again an opportunity for some warm-hearted attention

32
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:20,000
non-aversion just noticing the mind is wandered

33
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,039
and begin again with the sensations of

34
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
breathing

35
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,200
is there a way in which we can practice mindfulness with an attitude of warmth

36
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:08,640
and care whatever might be arising

37
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,560
can we have an openheartedness

38
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:23,839
jack cornfield describes mindfulness as loving awareness

39
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:37,839
can we practice with loving awareness

40
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:43,840
to meditate with a sense of loving awareness

41
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:50,880
having an attitude of warmth to our mindfulness

42
00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:00,000
help support and nourish

43
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,840
not only our meditation practice but our inner life

44
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:15,039
so that we might show up in the world having this foundation of

45
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:22,240
warm-heartedness so that our practice might be for the

46
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,440
benefit of ourselves but also for the benefit of those

47
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,200
with whom we come into contact

48
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:40,480
so that all beings may be free from suffering

49
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:53,840
without exception

50
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:34,480
i feel like um tonight's a little bit of comedy of errors i didn't get the sound right and maybe you

51
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,440
guys didn't notice but the bell fell off of the where i'm sitting here

52
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:54,559
so welcome welcome everybody it's nice to be here

53
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:03,520
i'm saying here right of course i'm at the imc by myself and i'm imagining that soon we'll be

54
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,960
practicing together i don't know exactly when

55
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:17,200
there was talk that we were going to open on august 1st but now it seems that the county might

56
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,880
have placed some restrictions asking for mask wearing indoors

57
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,159
so we haven't made any changes to that plan about august 1st but we might

58
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:34,720
so keep an eye on the website if you're planning on coming we might postpone our opening for a

59
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,120
little bit

60
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,799
okay so today i'd like to continue my discussion

61
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:50,559
of the pyramids these ten qualities

62
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:56,960
that are often expressed in our daily life not exclusively but can be expressed in our daily life

63
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,679
as a support for awakening as support for liberation as a support

64
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,039
for greater peace and freedom in our lives

65
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,520
and so this word parameter it is related to the mean of like

66
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:22,960
taken to the far that's kind of far and paramy or related so something taken the farthest as a

67
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:30,559
sense of completeness has a sense of the highest state possible

68
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:35,919
and that's why sometimes it's translated as the perfections

69
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:44,399
sometimes i'm a little hesitant to use this expression perfections because implicit in that is imperfection

70
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:52,320
and we might like this perfection it feels like it's just such a high ideal that we might even feel

71
00:29:52,320 --> 00:30:00,240
a little bit dissuaded from even working on it at all but parame as maybe instead of farthest we

72
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,640
could also understand it as kind of going further so developing

73
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,480
growing like enhancing these qualities so what are these

74
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:20,840
qualities it's a list of 10 generosity ethical behavior

75
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:28,080
renunciation wisdom energy patience truthfulness resolve

76
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,039
loving kindness and equanimity

77
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:39,440
in the first five so the next one should be patients but i'm not going to talk about patients

78
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:46,480
tonight i'm going to talk about loving-kindness which is the ninth parame

79
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:53,120
there's a few reasons and one of it is related to just what i was talking about how sometimes we hear this idea of

80
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,360
perfection maybe we don't even notice it it might be a subtle way in which there might be

81
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:07,200
this that our inner critic might roar it's itself and say oh well

82
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:14,000
i'm far from perfect and i'm not why should i even bother or something like this

83
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:22,159
but loving kindness is a way in which we can meet whatever is arising with some openness

84
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,760
some spaciousness some ease some warm-heartedness

85
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:34,799
so mindfulness and loving-kindness aren't exactly the same but they're related and as i go through

86
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,519
the talk maybe i'll highlight some of the differences

87
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,080
so loving-kindness as many of you know is the translation of the word meta so

88
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:53,919
it's the metta parami but loving-kindness isn't the only translation we could use goodwill

89
00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:01,360
well-wishing benevolence friendliness kindness

90
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,799
kind fullness and i've seen a handful of them and maybe you have your own

91
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,360
favorite translation of meta

92
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:20,720
one way we might understand it is as a heartfelt concern for the welfare and happiness

93
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:28,000
of all living beings as a parame it's for all living beings

94
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:36,320
without discrimination without reservation and of course includes ourselves

95
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:42,720
so the pyramid is kind of like taken to the farthest the complete version is to have this

96
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,640
warm-hearted wish for the welfare of all living beings

97
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:56,080
but sometimes you know love and kindness it might feel like it's um associated with love

98
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,600
which is a beautiful beautiful quality but sometimes love we might hear this and it might

99
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,440
feel sappy or sentimental or saccharine

100
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,720
and meta isn't sappy or sentimental or saccharine

101
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,679
and so in fact some of you might know this that the near enemy of meta that is that which

102
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,720
looks like or is uh is a facsimile of or

103
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,600
maybe can pass as meta but isn't quite meta is

104
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:39,600
affection with attachment so it's the warm heartedness but it's uh intermingled with your

105
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,840
mind or or um you

106
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:53,679
this wish for things to be a certain way like i want it's not unconditional like i love you

107
00:33:53,679 --> 00:34:01,440
as long as you behave properly when you don't behave properly then i have different feelings

108
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:09,919
but it's just perfectly natural that loving kindness and attachment are mixed in this

109
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:16,398
human life they're different whereas meta is an offering and

110
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:22,878
attachment is more of a holding there's this different uh movements

111
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:29,839
an opening and maybe like of a closing and we might say that the difficulties

112
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,520
that we have in our relationships arise from this root of attachment that

113
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:42,800
is any possessiveness or rejection or fear that we might have in our relationships

114
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:49,599
are associated with this attachment that is often intermingled with

115
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,440
loving-kindness it's perfectly natural to have this and it's part of the human

116
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:02,640
experience to have this intermingling so meta is a parameter

117
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:10,880
is an encouragement for us to notice where is this attachment where is there some holding

118
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:16,960
and can we also notice when there's some just pure wish for the welfare and happiness

119
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,880
of others this pure warm heartedness

120
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,760
good will well wishing so in the same way that mata is

121
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,359
universal it doesn't make distinctions whereas attachment is particular

122
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:43,839
attached to this person but not that person presmetta is more of a even

123
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:50,640
radiance or something like this so in this way mata is an expression of

124
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:58,160
freedom it's not an expression of clinging not an expression of attachment

125
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:06,079
and since the awakening and freedom is the guide is the measure is the goal

126
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:13,760
of parame practice again you know we can use this word goal we'll hold this lightly

127
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:22,000
but is the direction of our practice so metta parame includes those forms of

128
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,040
love or goodwill that are characterized by freedom

129
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:33,839
so has this quality of freedom associated with it as opposed to some

130
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:39,119
clinging or some attachment but clinging also can be expressed as

131
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:45,520
greed or hatred and loving-kindness of course is like an

132
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,640
antidote to hatred or if hatred is too strong a word maybe ill will or

133
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,320
maybe we can even say aversion we know that greed and hatred are some

134
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,520
of the roots of the defilement so loving-kindness manta

135
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,240
is some of the antidote like the opposite in the opposite direction we don't simultaneously have this

136
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:16,400
warm-hearted care for somebody at the same time that we have hostility and ill will towards them

137
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,720
and so the eightfold path also is has the guide and measure

138
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,400
and goal as freedom and it's not surprising that the

139
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,640
eightfold path and the parameters are towards awakening and freedom to support that

140
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:44,160
and part of the eightfold path is the second step is right intention wise intention

141
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:52,640
and part of wise intention is non-greed non-it will and non-harming

142
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:00,160
so non-greed sometimes can be understood as renunciation which is another of the pyramids it could also be

143
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,839
generosity perhaps but none non-ill will is often understood

144
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:14,320
as meta loving-kindness so loving-kindness as an intention

145
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,839
as an underlying

146
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:26,960
support for our mental activities as maybe as substratum or maybe maybe

147
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,079
even just a stratum of our of the direction our life is

148
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:38,000
going or when we're expressing the eightfold path when we're practicing with the

149
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,599
eightfold path we're not filled with ill-will instead there's manta

150
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:51,640
non-ill and then the third aspect of right intention is

151
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:58,160
non-harming which is compassion and of course compassion and mata

152
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:05,119
karuna and mehta are related that is that loving-kindness is this

153
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:11,200
warm-hearted wish for the welfare of all beings that's radiating out and it's just

154
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:19,440
natural that when the radiating out it would come into contact with individuals that are suffering

155
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:26,079
and so that sincere wish for their suffering to end is compassion so

156
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:32,640
mata plus suffering equals compassion

157
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,560
so in this way that love not only meta but karuna

158
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:44,480
loving-kindness and compassion are not only a part of the evil path but they work together as

159
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:51,839
part of a part of the pyramids as well this wish for the suffering to end our

160
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:57,040
own suffering and the suffering of others

161
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,560
but ill will also shows up in subtle ways

162
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:11,119
i'm talking about the eightfold path has the intention of you know non-ill will not having hostility not wanting to harm

163
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,680
others not being angry with others

164
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:23,599
sometimes when we're angry we don't have access to our best wisdom

165
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,200
and sometimes there that energy can feel um like it's not directed in a way

166
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:35,040
that's wholesome and helpful so the eightfold path includes non-ill non-anger

167
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,319
so this is maybe a more obvious way in which ill will might be expressed

168
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:45,680
but ill will can also be expressed in subtle ways

169
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:51,520
that is when we encounter suffering there's often this tendency to think if we don't have loving

170
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,640
kindness already there's this idea of like this needs to be different

171
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,960
and whether that shows up like just an uncomfortable sensation when we're meditating

172
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,880
i know for quite some time when i'd meditated have this sound in my ear and i could and it

173
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:16,480
wouldn't go away and i could just feel kind of like the anger that would like be arising like

174
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:24,000
dang it don't you know that i'm trying to meditate now i can't meditate with this in this

175
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,640
sense of um like hostility and really wanting to push it away

176
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,720
so when there's this when we come up with difficulties it

177
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:43,359
might start out as subtle like um i wish that weren't there or it might flare up into something

178
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:50,240
obvious like anger but when it's really a subtle it might

179
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:56,720
be of this sense of like oh this has to be different or maybe there's a sense of irritation

180
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:04,640
or fault finding or having a grudge against something so just ways kind of

181
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:11,440
the heart and the mind might lean in these directions so these are like more subtle ways

182
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,920
or maybe instead of the sense of like this needs to be different there's a sense of i need to be different if there's

183
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:24,160
suffering if there's something that's uncomfortable then i need to be different this is a way

184
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:31,839
also a little bit of a subtle way in which ill will shows up against ourselves

185
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:39,280
is not a sense of not being good enough this sense of inadequacy the inner critic just getting

186
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:45,838
a toehold and then often it can go running

187
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,880
so loving-kindness is a way that if we practice with loving-kindness and have this intention of

188
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,720
loving-kindness is a way in which we might be able to embed in the

189
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:09,040
i i keep on using this word substratum but i'm not sure that's the right word and the foundation in the milieu

190
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:16,000
in which um we think in our inner life is a way in which some of even these

191
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,119
subtle forms of ill will can be counteracted and maybe not given the

192
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:29,760
chance to flare up into something like anger or some real inner critic some self-loathing

193
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:36,160
another way in which ill will might show up and which loving kindness or meta can be a

194
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:42,400
support to counteract or to be an antidote is when there's a strong sense of us

195
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:50,000
versus them me versus you me against the world whenever there's a

196
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:59,760
strong sense of the separation there's also this subtle sense of ill-will there

197
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,760
with meta there's not such a strong sense of course we can make distinctions

198
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,960
and use discernment but there isn't that such a strong separation

199
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,200
me versus you us versus them

200
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:23,119
and so practicing with loving kindness practicing with menta meta as a parameter is a way in which we can

201
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:30,000
soften some of these boundaries that we are making that are being supported by a

202
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,599
will and instead maybe allows us to

203
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:43,599
be with the irritating without collapsing without shutting down to be with the unfair to be

204
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:50,000
with the messy so in this way meta is

205
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,400
also going to be a support for equanimity in which we don't lose our balance but instead can

206
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:04,160
just be with what's happening and not collapsing into making these distinct separations

207
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:19,839
or just collapsing into numbness excuse me here

208
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:46,240
make sure that i'm pushing all the right buttons here

209
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,440
so meta as an antidote to ill will both the obvious ways of ill will

210
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:58,839
but maybe even really the subtle ways like the aversion or the creating a strong sense of

211
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:05,200
separation and the suit does talk about how

212
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:11,680
a heart released with meta is brighter than any

213
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,880
axe we might do or any meritorious acts in particular

214
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,480
and in the time of the buddha meritorious acts that is things that were done in

215
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,400
order to garner merit we're definitely concerned with like separation between individuals

216
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:35,280
and maybe a little bit of attachment i'm going to do this and that i'm going to have this particular reward

217
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:41,520
so marriage is a little bit more associated with the everyday life there's nothing wrong with

218
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:48,720
gathering merit absolutely nothing wrong with it they're an integral part of the path

219
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:56,560
but at the time of the buddha merit was also associated with ritual sacrifices

220
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:02,319
not in buddhism but in one of the dominant traditions the dominant religions of the

221
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:08,960
time they would do rituals ritual sacrifices of sometimes living beings

222
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,599
as a way to please the gods or to garner a particular outcome

223
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:23,680
so in contrast to these things the mata and especially

224
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:30,079
the a heart released via mata some of you may know in pauli the word

225
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:37,280
for heart chitta can also be translated as mind so the mind released by mata and the

226
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:44,000
heart released by manta well so here's asuta quote

227
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:51,920
just as the radiance of all the stars does not equal a 16th part of the moon's

228
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,920
radiance just saying that the moon the brightness of the moon is so much

229
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:05,839
brighter than the brightness of the stars but the moon's radius surpasses them and

230
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:11,440
shines forth bright and brilliant in the same way

231
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:18,400
of all the grounds for making worldly merit none are worth a 16th part of the

232
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:26,400
heart's released by metta the hearts released by manta surpasses them and shines forth bright

233
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:33,599
and brilliant this idea of when we have this manta that it's a

234
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:40,640
beautiful thing has a luminosity it has a irradiance to it

235
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:48,319
and part of the reason we might say that there's this radiance is in the same suta as another stanza is

236
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:54,079
another verse that says one who actively develops

237
00:48:54,079 --> 00:49:02,000
meta mindfully and without limit sees their attachments wane

238
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,559
their bonds become worn thin

239
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:14,880
so this developing of mata this cultivating of mata that mindfully and without limit

240
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,880
so to so it's that it's boundless and it's for all beings everywhere like

241
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:27,440
we would with a parame we see their attachments wane so things that we're attached to

242
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:34,160
there's a softening of this there's a letting go and the bonds the fetters that keep us

243
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:40,960
tied to our difficulties into suffering become thin this is the direction we want to go

244
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,079
right towards greater freedom so this first line one who actively

245
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:52,319
develops mata how do we develop mata there's a number of different ways

246
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:58,000
one is just in our daily life how we can

247
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,640
when we meet people especially as the pandemic is ending and

248
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,000
many of us are moving about in social situations more than we were before

249
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,720
just noticing how we feel when we meet people that is there a sense this inner sense

250
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:22,960
of friendliness that we're having do we have some warm-heartedness or maybe not

251
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:29,920
maybe we have some were you feeling uh reserved or a little bit held back

252
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:35,839
maybe you could have this inquiry of noticing okay what does it feel like when there's

253
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:43,359
more warm-heartedness and less open-heartedness it's perfectly natural right in our

254
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:49,119
daily life when we're not practicing loving-kindness to have more or less

255
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:56,559
so how does that feel how can you tell the difference what does love and kindness feel like

256
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,559
what does meta pure mata feel like what does it feel like when it's tangled up or

257
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:10,559
associated with attachment what does it feel like when there's a little bit of a version just in our daily life so that's one way

258
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:19,040
to practice developing meta is just becoming familiar how does it feel like in the mind

259
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:25,040
and in the body and is there a way in can you notice there's

260
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:31,040
ways in which it's more likely to arise so that's one way another

261
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:37,680
is the metasuta some of you might be familiar with this i'm not going to go into detail now but

262
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:45,200
this is kind of like a beloved chant in our tradition i believe it's the most common chant

263
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:52,960
certainly here at probably imc and maybe spirit rock and ims but it

264
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,240
might also be the most common chant in without southeast asia as well for teravata

265
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:03,359
buddhas the metasuta that's about this quality

266
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:09,680
of love and kindness and the cultivating it and showing up in the world with it and

267
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:17,599
it also talks about how it leads to freedom so in some ways like the metasuta

268
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:24,480
is in some ways a guidance of the metta parame that leads to greater freedom so one way

269
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:33,040
to practice cultivating developing meta is to practice with the metasuta chant it

270
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:39,760
to listen to it to memorize it to maybe contemplate it maybe

271
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:45,680
investigate it a little bit we don't have to make it complicated you

272
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:51,680
know there's been plenty of analysis that's done on of it if you like you could but you could also

273
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:57,040
just very simply listen there's a point online you'll find

274
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:05,200
if you just put in metasuta chant you'll find plenty of versions of it and just see how it feels so that's a

275
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,960
second way in which we can cultivate and develop loving kindness

276
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:19,200
and a third way maybe i'll actually just share this story this uh

277
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:27,599
when i was in chaplaincy training part of the training was um we went to our funeral home and

278
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:34,880
we found ourselves there's a group of us that were there and we found ourselves in a chapel

279
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:41,359
with um a casket but uh i had a corpse in the casket

280
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:46,480
and we were kind of surprised we didn't know that that was going to happen it

281
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:53,119
was just us there with this casket and we kind of like looked at one

282
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:58,319
another and we weren't quite sure what to do but we

283
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:05,440
wanted to honor and respect this corpse this uh

284
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:12,559
person this that used to be alive that is now here and so we chanted the mata suta it's

285
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:20,559
just kind of an expression of our well-wishing expression of our warmth expression of

286
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:27,280
i don't know a way for us to join our voices together and put something out there so maybe it

287
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:32,640
doesn't make perfect logical sense but in some way it felt like a beautiful

288
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:38,400
thing to do so there might be a way in which

289
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:44,240
learning or practicing with the metasuta it might show up in your life in a way

290
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:51,440
that's unexpected it might be a support or a a

291
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,799
resource yeah i'll say there were times early in

292
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:01,839
my meditation practice when i would have difficulties and i would um i had memorized the

293
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:09,119
metasuta and i would just chant the metasuta while i was meditating and they've just created a different

294
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:16,480
atmosphere different attitude in the mind so chanting the matasuta

295
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:35,839
and then of course the third one is sorry i'm gonna cough here

296
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:51,119
my apologies my apologies i'm not sure what's why my throat is uh misbehaving a little

297
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:56,720
bit here so a third way to practice with uh loving kindness

298
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:03,839
is of course to do loving-kindness meditation meta meditation chances are many of you

299
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:10,799
are familiar with this maybe i'll just say briefly there's two ways in which we can do this

300
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:15,839
one is the sense of just radiating meta

301
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:20,640
indiscriminately just sending it out

302
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:27,680
and there's a suita that talks about this and i'll just say briefly one dwells

303
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:34,240
pervading one direction with a mind imbued with metta likewise the second

304
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:41,760
direction direction likewise the third and the fourth so above below and all around

305
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:49,040
one dwells pervading everywhere and in every way the entire world with a mind imbued with

306
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:58,079
menta so just the sense of radiating goodwill out

307
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:03,359
so kind of like having a sense of just wishing benevolence

308
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:08,880
doing well wishing out and then the second way which is maybe

309
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:15,040
more familiar is a little bit more structured and specific and

310
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:22,640
we would cultivate loving-kindness to a particular person a benefactor ourself

311
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:29,760
a friend a neutral person a difficult person and kind of like progressively in a

312
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,799
systematic way sending loving kindness using phrases often

313
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:41,599
to different uh individuals or categories of individuals so two ways to practice one where you

314
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:47,599
just kind of radiate loving-kindness in all directions and one in which it's kind of like a little

315
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:55,760
bit more specific to individuals whichever way it's all good it's all good this way in

316
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,799
which we can cultivate and develop meta as a way to support

317
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:07,440
greater freedom and greater ease so we can have the perfection of meta

318
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:14,000
and which allows it to wish well being for all beings

319
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:23,839
everywhere thank you
