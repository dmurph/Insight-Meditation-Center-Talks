1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,359
i want to start today with uh three little vignettes

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,440
that were important for me in my life and the first one was when i was a

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,240
relatively new zen student i was living at a zen center san francisco zen center

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,599
and i was back in the 1970s and there were not very many zen masters

5
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,439
in the united states at that time but they decided to have a

6
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:38,719
meeting among themselves a gathering to talk about whatever they had in common or issues they had or something

7
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,760
and and so they gathered for i think two or three days and had these private

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,800
meetings with monkeys themselves but then one evening they offered to be available as a panel

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,719
to maybe take questions from the students who lived there and students who were taking care of them and hosting

10
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,120
them and all that so that was nice and so i was in the audience and they were kind of when i

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,320
laid out they were all kind of sitting behind this long tables um this seven or nine of them

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,759
and uh it was kind of for me as a young and impressionable was a pretty formidable

13
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,119
group of teachers sitting there but i was watching them

14
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,360
and at some point someone came along to give them tea or water each of them maybe came with a tray or something and

15
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,759
and came up from behind them like a good server i guess and kind of reached over and put the cup they had

16
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:41,119
in front of them so they have something to drink and and they all kind of were kind of

17
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,600
just accepted it that there was no the zen teachers had no they just received it and was there they didn't react or

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,560
respond to receiving it at all except for one and one of them when the server came to

19
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,920
offer it turned completely around to the server acknowledge the server was there

20
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:07,200
and thanked the person who brought it and the contrast between the ones who kind of just like you know were almost

21
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,680
like oblivious the person offering and the one who took the time to really like that person was the most important

22
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,000
person at that moment and so the person that the teacher was going to turn and really be there and

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,879
see and recognize and and uh and thank the person i was so impressed by that oh that's quite

24
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,640
something what are the other people doing i thought so that inspired me

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,560
so that was one vignette the other vignette was in the same zen center some years later

26
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,360
there was a visiting monk from japan who uh we were sitting at sashim a seven day retreat and he was sitting next to

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,280
me in the hall and the way that it worked then is that um

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,120
every afternoon during the retreat in the meditation hall

29
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,720
we've been sitting like i'm sitting up here on the stage they'll be kind of sitting in facing the middle of

30
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,280
the room everyone's around the edges of the room and and people would come in and offer us

31
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,720
tea and a cookie but the first day of the retreat first afternoon they also came with a tray of

32
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,560
cups and we kept our each of us kept our own cup next to our seeds for the week

33
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,280
at the end of the retreat we were all supposed to uh they came in to gather the cups we've been using so

34
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,200
they gave us tea they gave us a cookie and when that was finished they came to collect all the used cups and used for a

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,519
week so the visiting japanese monk who was sitting next to me you know it's all choreographed in zen

36
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,560
you're supposed to exactly when you're supposed to bow and chant and stand up and sit down it's all kind of like you

37
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,480
know choreographed on schedule so if you someone said something is a little bit out of the usual it stands

38
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,840
out so we were he was sitting next to me and his uh

39
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,480
his cup was on the on the platform in front of him and before the server came

40
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,080
he bowed to the cup and that wow

41
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,160
that's a respecting appreciating having gratitude for the cup i don't know what he was expressing but

42
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,120
i think i thought it was kind of partly gratitude but the fact that you would express this to a cup

43
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,880
that was inspiring as well not just people that you'd respect not just people you would

44
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,360
thank or express something but to a cup that was the second vignette

45
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,440
the third was when i was in graduate school i was studying religious studies buddhist studies at religious studies

46
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,759
department but i took a class from the history department i think i think the class was some like the history of japanese

47
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,479
buddhism maybe it had to do with japanese history and

48
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,759
and so uh somehow we were learning all these facts about

49
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,600
history and uh uh uh

50
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,960
there was some little fact that was told and we were preparing for the finals or

51
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,120
something and so i i said to the professor um

52
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,160
so this spectacular thing is not so important right that we have to know this

53
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,840
and uh and he looked at me and he said gil everything is important

54
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,320
and that wow that that was quite something so oh everything is important

55
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,639
so there this idea that you know when you're studying history use everything has its value and but i kind of

56
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:50,160
it kind of echoed my mind all kinds of situations everything is important everything is respect worthy

57
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,440
so i think what they have in common these three stories is the idea of respect

58
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,479
and uh and i respect is a very important attitude

59
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,520
behavior that that in many societies many religious many people

60
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,680
it uh i have never heard a dharma talk about respect i've been listening to dharma's talks for

61
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,280
almost 50 years and i've never heard one about respect i've never seen anybody actually writing

62
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,759
about respect there must be someone but i'm not that well written read you know so

63
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,800
and uh but if you go back to look at the teachings of the buddha

64
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,560
the concept of respect is uh is all over

65
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:45,360
it's kind of like sprinkled in all over however it's not on any list

66
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,240
so if you're going to like to teach lists it's not there it's not i described as having any role

67
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,560
for the path of awakening because that's a very specific kind of listing of practices and

68
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:06,240
mental experiences that happen on that path but respect is not listed there so the things that

69
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:13,039
you know that people often use for dharma talks they're talking about important things

70
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,639
things that are important you know understood those things that stand out the things you'd read an introduction to buddhism book and there

71
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,440
it is you know this is what it's all about or something and uh respect doesn't uh rise to the

72
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:33,360
surface high enough to be talked about an introduction to buddhism texts you know or entered a buddhism

73
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,599
dharma talks in all kinds of places that i've heard maybe some of you heard differently

74
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,599
and however it sprinkled it all over and the impression i have is that respect it was

75
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:52,639
just an assumed important quality maybe of a society at the time of the buddha but

76
00:07:52,639 --> 00:08:00,080
just assumed there's a very important quality people have that you didn't have to teach it specially you just mentioned it

77
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,759
and in fact it gets mentioned in all kinds of places uh one place is that it's mentioned

78
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,960
together with gratitude and contentment and i think also something there's

79
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:18,400
something that i've been translating english as deference yeah so uh respect deference contentment and

80
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,400
gratitude are great treasures or great blessings

81
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,520
the and in the this course on loving

82
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,880
kindness there's an emphasis on respect and uh and one of wonderful teachings about it

83
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,240
where it's connected to a day of respect is connected directly with love

84
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,760
pia the love or chair or appreciation or deep

85
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,240
deep regard for other things and and then it's also connected with um

86
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,839
social cohesion non-dispute concord and unity

87
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:07,519
so those wonderful things are all connected somehow in association with respect and the buddha teaches six things

88
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:15,360
uh actually four four things that are conducive to this love respect

89
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:23,040
cohesion non-dispute concord and unity and these are uh loving kindness

90
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,240
or friendliness kindness that if we live a life of kindness and

91
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,320
that conduces to love and respect if uh

92
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,160
generosity if we live a life that's generous that also is conducive to

93
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,640
love and respect and so forth and if we live an ethical life

94
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,880
that also is conducive to love and respect and finally

95
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,279
developing the insight that's that leads to awakening liberating insight

96
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,399
having that insight having that experience of liberation that also

97
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,600
our being on the path of that also is conducive to love and respect

98
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,839
and so i think when you meet someone who is very mature in the dharma practice it tends to kind

99
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,360
of bring up a certain level of respect that appreciation of that person

100
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:28,560
there's a fascinating story of the buddha after his soon after he was enlightened

101
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,880
he said to himself that someone uh will live

102
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,920
an unpleasant life for an uncomfortable life if they don't have

103
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:51,839
respect and deference and a certain kind of reliance on others

104
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,240
and uh so it's an interesting idea so he's so so then he looked around and he said

105
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,000
well actually there's no one who is more realized than i am

106
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,200
so it doesn't make sense for me to have respect indeference or to rely on them to have certain kind dependence on them

107
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,320
because you know you know i'm i'm complete i'm complete in my awakening

108
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,760
so what should i have respect for then if it's not a if not a person

109
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,440
and he said i'll have respect for the dharma by which i was awakened i will he

110
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,519
actually said respect homage or honoring

111
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,640
and reliance so the idea of respect honoring and

112
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,760
reliance not a person but some some the the

113
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,880
the uh the dharma the teachings the truth the

114
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:57,120
processes of awakening that exist within each of us so here also the idea of respect appears

115
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,240
so respect is a fascinating social attitude it's complicated because it means so many different things

116
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,440
in english we use the word respect and sometimes it has you know it's more has more to do with fear

117
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,800
than it is you know that then it's not really respect but we might say you know i have respect for

118
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,160
something but this person who's saying i fear it but

119
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,200
the but uh as as an attitude

120
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:36,959
of appreciation of others an attitude of valuing another person

121
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:43,279
seeing their worth or their importance every everything's important including each person

122
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,399
and so to have an appreciation for the value of others

123
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,480
it when there's respect it's a very interesting

124
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,120
mental kind of process to do respect

125
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:07,040
to have respect as many of you know involves that i like that it involves um

126
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,720
seeing again taking a deeper look at what's going on there's a latin uh respect like

127
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,120
spectator or spectacle or something to look and then to re it means again to look again

128
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,480
so something is respect worthy we want to take a deeper look at it

129
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,720
but a deeper look is also deeper listening like this thing is whatever this person is

130
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:37,200
is worthy of me paying attention to it's not only about

131
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,519
me myself and mine it's not only about what i want or what i'm afraid of

132
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:50,480
or how it supports my self-centeredness or something there's a kind of a dropping of self-centeredness dropping of

133
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,399
my likes my preferences in order to hear or listen or take in

134
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:04,240
the other person in a good way there is a kind of kind of a healthy i think deference to

135
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,320
others when you have respect there's a putting yourself aside slightly

136
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,440
in order to take in to let the person to register the person to make space for the person to to there's that kind of

137
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,360
difference even just to listen to someone what they have to say is the kind of difference

138
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:31,199
we put aside me myself and mine a little bit so respect involves a kind of attitude

139
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,639
where other people are important enough that we do kind of put ourselves

140
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,760
some part of ourselves aside and it has to do

141
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:49,120
the focus becomes on the person the object that we have respect for

142
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,120
but it's not a giving up of oneself because at the same time

143
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,040
when we have respect for someone else we're the agent of the respect

144
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:07,440
where they we're the one who's empowering the respect we're the ones who is living their respect

145
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,639
and so uh it is a it comes from a place of certain kind of

146
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:20,320
confidence certain kind hopefully certain kind of ability to offer something here

147
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,320
so ourselves are the subject of the respect as the person who has respect part of

148
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:34,079
who we are is put aside our preferences and our likes our our self-centeredness so we can take

149
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:40,880
in and really register the other person but part of us comes forward the ability

150
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:47,600
to do that and the ability to appreciate somebody else to to value

151
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,600
them and this is a mental movement this is not just a casual thing just kind of

152
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,720
stumbling along and you know bumped into someone

153
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:06,320
and it takes really a certain kind of stopping and taking in and registering and having a kind of

154
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:14,480
mental process that values appreciates and values the person that we're with

155
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:21,040
that you wouldn't get that message that's important when people or dharma teachers for example teach

156
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:28,000
about some of the higher reaches of dharma practice where they talk about not-self

157
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,199
you know you know you're supposed to everything itself disappears completely or sometimes you talk about

158
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,240
it knows that there's a no separate self and some idea of merging or disappearing

159
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:45,759
of the self and the other person respect doesn't it is not doesn't involve that respect involves a very

160
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,440
clear distinction between you as the subject and the person is the

161
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,720
object for that respect and the advantage of that is that some there's a synthesis of that

162
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,640
or the the chemistry of that there's something beautiful that can happen in

163
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,079
there can be love there can be

164
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,640
respect there can be appreciation there can be

165
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,720
a dropping of certain kind of self-centeredness the dropping of self-preoccupation

166
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,600
and the strengthening of a kind of confidence i would like to propose that

167
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,039
healthy respect involves a healthy confidence

168
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:40,480
to offer respect and have no confidence the respect might be more of a

169
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,520
of a belittling of oneself making oneself small

170
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,520
in relationship to the other person almost like subservient sometimes but i think that the

171
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,559
the the the more confident we are in ourselves

172
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,919
the more value there is in our respect

173
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,039
the more we belittle ourselves the less power or less energy of there

174
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:14,320
is in the respect itself so does respect have a role in buddhist

175
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,679
practice and apparently it does it's kind of

176
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,080
you know at least for the buddha it may be it's it's so fundamental he doesn't have to say it's part of buddhist practice it's just assumed as a

177
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,919
foundation and uh and i find that

178
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,360
having respect for my teachers has been it was very important for me there was a time where i felt like i'm

179
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:44,160
not really going to study with that teacher anymore but but uh i still had tremendous respect

180
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,240
and deference to them if some of my teachers told me um i gave i gave my teachers this authority over

181
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:57,200
me i said if they ever come to me and say gil you have to stop teaching i would have said okay

182
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,679
that you know there's a few people who would if they told me that i would i wouldn't question it i was okay

183
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,280
because i had that respect and that reliance that dependence on their on on them that felt

184
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,120
important for me to have so that i wasn't just being barreling ahead with my own

185
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,880
you know self-centered orientation around all this and there was someone who was my i was accountable to or that

186
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,880
someone that i was willing to listen to and hear from it

187
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,880
but more even more significant for me is the respect i have for the dharma

188
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,480
for the practice that it it also is not and the dharma

189
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,400
the practice and also karma uh i've learned through my life experiences

190
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,160
that these are powerful forces in the human heart human mind and that are not

191
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:58,240
related to not how to say this that are kind of uh non-personal

192
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,440
but how i personally live affects it so it's to connect it to the

193
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,880
personal but it's somehow bigger than or it's a larger process too and so for me trusting the dharma or

194
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:20,559
trusting meditation or respecting it is to respect this this this process or this force or this

195
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:28,080
this uh these natural processes

196
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:35,360
that uh in order to that are valuable and important and profound

197
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:42,559
that i i get out of the way for if i respect my meditation respect my

198
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:49,200
dharma it's here also i put aside my preferences and my

199
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,039
likes and dislikes what i want in order to allow some make room for

200
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,320
something deeper to happen to allow for myself to listen and hear

201
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,159
and sort of see something that's happening here that is different

202
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,679
than uh than me myself and mine and i've learned i've seen this over and

203
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,679
over again this transformation you know this movement this change that happens in meditation

204
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,799
where sometimes it's only in meditation i realize i've been spending the last

205
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,559
hours somehow caught up in my thoughts or caught up in some personal concern

206
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,400
and then to watch and see it melt away or drop away or or to be able to meditation seed through it to the other

207
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,159
kind of on the other side of it there's more going on here than what i was allowing myself to tap

208
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,360
into when i was going around my life to caring for things

209
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,880
so to have this respect for that process respect for meditation

210
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:58,440
respect for dharma so when we show up to meditate there is a kind of

211
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,400
both putting ourselves aside and kind of bringing ourselves forward

212
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,240
at the same time putting ourselves aside because it's not about me myself and

213
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,840
mine only it's not about my i keep saying my likes and dislikes my preferences

214
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,159
what i want so that's putting that aside but it's also about coming forward more

215
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,360
fully because i'm here to listen i'm here to really wake up and see

216
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,360
to to let allow life to show itself allow myself to

217
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,400
receive allow myself to be impacted by the dharma

218
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,159
the dharma is operating here let me let me show up and be available for it

219
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,600
and so this wonderful combination and this dance between this of uh

220
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,880
of uh letting go of self and bringing self into the picture

221
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,039
that i think is uh expressed very well with the word respect at least the way i'm talking

222
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:08,400
about it today and and perhaps there's a wonderful place for respect in our

223
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,760
dharma practice and maybe dharma practice would has a different

224
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,799
kind of confidence in it

225
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,320
and a kind of freedom in it when respect is uh brought along and bearing

226
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,640
attention so maybe you have have thought about this a lot

227
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:40,400
and uh but maybe if those of you who haven't maybe it will uh was well worth

228
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:48,000
some kind of uh deeper reflection about your relationship to re respect

229
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,279
and uh and uh in what way for you

230
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,559
does respect involve valuing what you respect what kind of valuing

231
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:05,840
what does it mean to see something as worthy and what if everything is important

232
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,559
what if uh every teacup is to be respected

233
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:19,840
what if everyone about if every everyone who you run into is someone who

234
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,120
warrants respect wouldn't you like to live that way

235
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,880
respecting everyone and who would benefit the most from that

236
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,520
you or those people being respected it'd be nice if it was equal

237
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,720
from both so respect that doesn't diminish us it

238
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,320
certainly doesn't diminish us but a respect that brings forth some of the best qualities of who

239
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:59,520
we are that is conducive to love cohesion non-dispute concord and unity

240
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,960
very nice thing so those are my thoughts for today

241
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,000
so uh do you have any uh

242
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,039
things you'd like to say about respect thoughts about it and

243
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:21,600
when you uh say where's yeah if you can bring it to him and then

244
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,279
uh if you can please say your name and and then

245
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:37,679
hi my name is barry i was thinking about mutual respect

246
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:43,360
that that is maybe the substrate of connection

247
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,520
mutual mutual respect yes yes uh and that

248
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:56,919
feeling respected by another makes it easier to respect them and vice versa

249
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:05,039
i was thinking about your story about talking to your teachers in a respectful manner respecting their opinions and

250
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:11,840
i was imagining that they were respecting you too as a teach as a student

251
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,799
yes thank you yes right here

252
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,000
good morning my name is jill and i'm sitting here with two

253
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:33,520
two thoughts that are struggling to come out as one question and i can't quite get there and the first thought is um

254
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:40,080
perhaps the um there's no teaching actual teaching

255
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,120
of respect in

256
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,640
the sutras it is it could it possibly be a matter of translation i know we

257
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:57,200
struggle with so many words maybe there's some little nugget in there that didn't quite make it to english

258
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:05,200
translation that combined with the fact that the word respect in our western culture

259
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,158
has so much baggage with it

260
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:17,279
when i was raised the phrase it always was used with the word show

261
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:23,520
you are to show respect and showing respect is very different than what we've spoken of

262
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:30,960
today so somehow i'm i'm kind of rolling through those two things together which

263
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,720
may mean that we just don't have a common language about it yet yeah i think that's very nice what

264
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,720
you're saying that the word respect is so complicated because all the different meanings of it and there's like a whole slew of

265
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,640
meanings and so some of them are not so so healthy and showing respect if it's only a show

266
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,240
that's why i was calling it an attitude at the beginning rather than a show

267
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,799
and uh but whether it's an issue of translation i don't know it's hard very hard to know

268
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:06,240
how properly to translate these words but that's why

269
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,880
but there's a slew there's a bunch of words which are closely related that sometimes appear in lists

270
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:19,760
and in english they get translated as respect reverence veneration and homage

271
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:26,640
so that's the family that we're talking about exactly what the you know exactly what it means in the different ones

272
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,559
and also there's the word that sometimes translates as difference is

273
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,960
is sometimes could also mean something like

274
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:48,080
being a gentle things like that and

275
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,960
the what's interesting about that how often they translate as differences if you read modern psychology's

276
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,559
philosophy about respect deference is often considered closely related

277
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,080
uh kind of goes along with it and so when i first saw that i had what deference that doesn't seem like a good

278
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,440
thing but uh but i think maybe maybe it is a good thing in a certain way or it can be a

279
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:18,399
good thing and so all these things part of the task is to discover how to do these things

280
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:25,760
not as a duty an obligation but how to do them in a way that's healthy that's supportive and beneficial and that's the

281
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,440
task of each person and that's what i think how mindfulness can help give us the inner

282
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,200
information we need in order to understand when we're doing things in a healthy way and when not and not in a

283
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,559
healthy way so what there's one more thing where

284
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:49,360
respect appears in the suttas and it's another thing so i said that respect is kind of maybe it's just

285
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:56,720
assumed maybe because it's a cultural value of the buddha he doesn't really teach it especially

286
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,240
but another another thing that's also found has the same thing very foundational

287
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:08,159
and he doesn't teach about it particularly and so it tends to be overlooked very

288
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:15,360
often in the suture gets mistranslated and that's taught about now a number of times anu kampa

289
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,399
which i translate as care and uh and

290
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:27,360
sometimes it gets translated as compassion but compassion requires someone to suffer technically

291
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,399
you know the dictionary definition so there has to be suffering to whether to be compassion or some reference to

292
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,919
suffering and wanting to alleviate that suffering but care

293
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:44,000
can be involved it can can involve a caring for people who aren't suffering

294
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:51,440
and the the caregiving emotion that buddha uses repeatedly is this word anu kampa

295
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,799
karuna the common buddhist word for compassion the buddha never uses as a

296
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:02,559
caregiving emotion in his in his teachings it's always this anu kampa

297
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:08,960
and so but then the question is what motivates anu kampa what motivates care and there's very little said about this

298
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:16,000
but when there is a couple of places where there's disgust it's motivated by respect

299
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:23,120
by respect reverence veneration and homage in one place another place just respect

300
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,519
and so these two fundamental things respect and care are hooked together

301
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:37,120
and then we care for people not because we have compassion for them our love for them we care for them because we have respect

302
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,840
and maybe respect is a kind of a more universal or more foundational or broader or

303
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,039
more you know it's like it love and compassion is wonderful and

304
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,480
profound but it does require a more active uh engagement maybe

305
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,720
respect is uh more basic and we can respect people that we don't love we can respect people we don't have

306
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,519
compassion for and anyway so that the our care of each

307
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,840
other comes from respect is one of them seems to be one of the teachings of the

308
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,720
buddha so i don't know if that was addressing your your two two thoughts

309
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,158
very helpful thank you so much

310
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:31,279
hi uh this is shawnee i think you were just getting starting to get to my question but i'm

311
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:37,600
also struggling a little bit with a different what i perceive as a different definitions of respect

312
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,880
i can understand kind of care as an attitude and

313
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:49,200
towards maybe everything and not worrying so much about what the object is but for respect it seems with some of

314
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,880
the words you're saying like difference or you know veneration or these words

315
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,440
it seems like there's a positive connotation towards the object so if there's um you know a difficult person

316
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,519
or a violent person or things i really don't agree with how would you approach respect in those

317
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:14,720
situations some people say what you do is you separate out their behavior from the from the person

318
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,720
and so that for the you you you someone who's difficult even maybe even dangerous

319
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,480
it's possible to respect their humanity but not their behavior and the behavior has to be addressed in a

320
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,240
particular way but you never lose sight of the respect for that person so the person feels all along

321
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,519
you just call the police on them but uh but boy that person did it in

322
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,720
such a respectful way he told me they were called the police you know

323
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,799
you know this is not really good and i wish you well but you know i would like to support you but this

324
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:56,399
can't continue so i'll call the police but i'll stay here while the police come and make sure they treat you well

325
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,000
something i don't know so so uh i don't know just making up a scenario but

326
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,158
uh i like to believe that we can find a way to have respect for the humanity of

327
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,760
people that's not dependent on their behavior

328
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,000
thank you

329
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,800
hi everyone my name is jan

330
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:39,040
what came to my mind was also since we barry and i have been

331
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,560
leading the sangha group after the talks um

332
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,919
how much i respect the sangha and have learned from the sangha

333
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,359
no matter how long people have been practicing it seems like there's always something to value and learn about

334
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:08,640
what someone is experiencing through the practice and also i was thinking about something

335
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:16,480
related to this from a talk that tunisia gave recently and the climate crisis

336
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,400
about how

337
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,079
consumerism really comes from a feeling of disconnection and not feeling like we

338
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,440
belong to each other and how important it is to value and

339
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,680
respect our connection to others in addition you know to the dharma

340
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:47,200
and the teachings of the buddha nice and this connection to others is related to the way in which self-respect and

341
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,560
respecting others are connected to each other and um you know disrespecting the

342
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:59,839
humanity of others is you know that's one way of talking about it but another way of talking about it

343
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:07,680
is that if you have self-respect you wouldn't want to have any disrespect for anyone else

344
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,680
because the act of disrespect is a way of diminishing oneself

345
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:20,000
so uh of course you'll have respect because if you have self-respect because that's what you're left with is respect for

346
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:28,480
others because the to not appreciate others is to is somehow i see it as a

347
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,800
as a uh not as a neutrality but as a kind of a

348
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,640
movement of disrespect

349
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,560
so what else anything else

350
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,400
i'm tanya and um yes i was just kind of imagining um you

351
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,000
know how the buddha often defines things by their opposite so i was thinking

352
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,359
i didn't find the word disrespect very visually imaginably helpful for me but i

353
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:19,040
was thinking about the word respect or we look and that to respect or we look right

354
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:25,680
and the opposite of that is to not look to not see to not regard to not take in

355
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,280
and how that's uh that's very painful and that's sort of

356
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,640
like the crime climate crisis not looking not seeing not respecting so

357
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:43,440
what comes to mind is that uh is that if you're calm and present for things

358
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:50,960
of course you'll take another look and so uh not looking is a kind of disregard

359
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,599
not looking is a kind of turning away and uh maybe respect involves we mean

360
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,520
means we never turn away or never turn our back on someone or

361
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:10,400
on the planet okay and so i hope this was nice for you and

362
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,480
uh i've never given a talk on this topic but lately i've been uh it's been on my mind my heart quite a

363
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:23,200
bit and i kind of find it kind of meaningful to spend time

364
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:31,640
reflecting on this topic so maybe you will too so thank you all very much

365
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,400
bye
