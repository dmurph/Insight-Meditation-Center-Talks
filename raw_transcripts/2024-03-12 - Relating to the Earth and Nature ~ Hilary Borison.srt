1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,639
so as I said earlier um I I'm a recent

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:15,000
graduate of the Eco chapy program and so this is a topic very dear

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,960
to my heart um so I've been on this long slow

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,920
Evolution towards being more connected with nature

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,360
um and this accelerated exponentially during the

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,960
pandemic so before the lockdown as people call it

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:48,280
um I would um I knew that I was always a little anxious in the mornings and I

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:55,800
would get up and get the kids off to school and go run errands and things like that um have my

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:03,760
meetings uh and I thought it was uh just this restlessness and anxiety was

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,880
just something that I just needed to get out into the world right and connect with people but then the pandemic came

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:19,840
and we couldn't go anywhere right we had to stay home and so I just went outside

12
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,520
my front door and sat on my patio and I

13
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,960
realized I just needed to be outside it was amazing how my nervous system

14
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:41,640
just powered down and so you know at first I just started

15
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,159
to uh meditate outside and then it became my

16
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,320
office um it was kind of funny the UPS man one time my husband was sitting out

17
00:01:53,320 --> 00:02:01,039
in the front UPS was like where is Hillary why are you in her office um so before that I used to

18
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,399
meditate inside and just trying to let go of my

19
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,599
egocentric worries right but if only I had known how

20
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:20,760
effortless it was to realize anata or not self just by going

21
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:28,360
outside right my fra ego buffeted by these eight worldly Winds of praise and

22
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,480
blame gain and loss Pleasure and Pain success and

23
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:40,440
failure that all fell away as I became part of a much

24
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:48,319
bigger ecosystem grass and trees bushes and

25
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:55,480
flowers birds and squirrels Big Blue Sky the clouds the

26
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,720
sun sometimes the rain I was no longer separate

27
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,480
self but part of something much bigger and interdependent and I realized that it

28
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,840
wasn't just up to me to go do stuff make things happen that all of nature was

29
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:22,879
working with me to help create balance and

30
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:29,200
equinity so this new feeling of belonging began to arise in me I

31
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,599
realized that the elements in my body were from the earth and formed in the

32
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:44,760
stars and that my genes were just the latest uh incarnation of a long line of

33
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:52,000
ancestors who had been through countless traumatic events including natural

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,599
disasters plagues Wars to say nothing of childbirth and

35
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:04,879
illness without Mom modern medicine and the most amazing thing of

36
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,599
all is the realization and this is not only true for me it's true for every single one of

37
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,320
us that's on the planet right now alive is that every single one of our

38
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,680
progenitors lived long enough to birth and care for the Next

39
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,479
Generation back through our parents our grandparents great great great grand

40
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:38,560
grandparents all the way back to the first human and the first

41
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,360
mammal on land and then in the water in the oceans all the way back to the first

42
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,320
one celled organism four and a half billion years

43
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:59,720
ago every single one in our line from that beginning to where we are now live

44
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:07,479
lived through all kinds of of traumatic events and wonderful events for us to be

45
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:14,919
here like just take a moment and take that in what is the probability of

46
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:21,039
that it's it's it's got to be less than 1% it's got to be something infinitism

47
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:28,639
small and yet we are all here

48
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,600
so there has been a lot of there have been a lot of ups and downs in the world's history and there's a lot of

49
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:43,560
disequilibrium on the planet right now not only in the what's happening um

50
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:51,479
in terms of politics and Wars but the the um the whole climate crisis right

51
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:59,080
and some people say that we're at a Tipping Point and there's not much time left and so some of some people are just

52
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:05,680
in total denial right oh just can't go there um and then others are just shut

53
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,919
down in fear and paralysis and some just want to distract

54
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,680
like I just want to try to be happy before you know it all burns

55
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,880
up but in Buddhism we are incouraged not to

56
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,080
tell ourselves stories right just be with what is don't tell yourself a story

57
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:38,440
but we humans do tell stories and the story We Tell

58
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,160
matters so it's called wise view the first step on the eight-fold

59
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:52,680
path with what eyes do we see if we see through the eyes of

60
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:59,639
hopelessness we will passively let things happen without taking action action is

61
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:07,919
the fourth step on on the path fful path but with hope we move out of freeze

62
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:15,800
into flow I love this definition of hope I read in a book called rooted by lean

63
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,160
leanda ly H I'm not sure if that's the right pronunciation but she found this in a

64
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:29,919
Benedictine library in a book it says hope is that virtue by which which we

65
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:39,680
take responsibility for the future we are co-creators right of our future which is

66
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,960
empowering she says the hope I'm interested in is about broad

67
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,440
perspectives with specific possibilities ones that invite or demand

68
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,840
that we act it's also not a sunny everything is going to get better

69
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,240
narrative though it may be a counter to the everything is getting worse

70
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:12,120
narrative you could call it an account of complexities and uncertainties with

71
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,280
openings it's a recognition that we in fact do have the capability to turn

72
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:25,520
things around and if we have wise intention step two on the path combined

73
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:33,919
with wise speech action livelihood and effort which are steps 3 through six we can do

74
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:40,560
this but first we must all learn to love this

75
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:47,680
beautiful Earth we will save what we love what we

76
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:54,519
cherish but part of the problem is as leanda says in rooting in countless ways

77
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:01,079
modern culture and urban habits contrive to separate us from our

78
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:08,600
indwelling earn intelligence while we have while we have

79
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,160
more scientific knowledge of the universe than any people ever had it is

80
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,240
not the type of knowledge that leads to an intimate presence within a meaningful

81
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,320
Universe with the rise of the modern Sciences we began to think of the

82
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:33,959
universe as a collection of objects rather than a communion of

83
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:39,440
subjects we talk about the Earth in terms of

84
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:49,360
resources not as source source of Life of nourishment of

85
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:57,600
beauty so Robin wal Kimmer is a Native American um scientist a

86
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:06,519
biologist she says that we it what we don't understand when

87
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:13,360
we see a bird or butterfly or tree or Rock whose name we don't know we it

88
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,839
it I would never point to you and call you it it would steal your

89
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:28,079
personhood itting turns gifts into natural resources it gives us permission

90
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:38,079
to see the land as an inanimate object these beings are not it they are our

91
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:44,560
relatives instead considering using key I think that's how she would pronounce

92
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:51,120
it key for singular or kin for plural spelled

93
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,760
Ki this is kimmer's imitation be more respectful of the

94
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:05,519
natural world by using key and instead of it these are variants of the ashabi word

95
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,560
Aki meaning Earthly being and if you're concerned that this

96
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:20,079
amounts to appropriation of native ideas kimra says that to appropriate is to steal whereas adoption of key and kin

97
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:26,360
reclaims the grammar of animacy and is thus a

98
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,360
gift so living beings even the Rocks the soil and the

99
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:39,120
water infused with life

100
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,399
so we we have this tendency to separate ourselves from nature so

101
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:51,680
objectify um but we also talk about taking a walk

102
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,880
or going for the for a hike in nature right but the truth is we are

103
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:05,040
nature natur we are nature going to take a walk in

104
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,120
nature so how often do we do that really mindfully when we when we do our walking

105
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,600
meditation we do that very mindfully how often do we take a walk without taking our

106
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,560
phone without chatting with someone or listening to a podcast or listening to

107
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:31,079
music or or just snapping pictures all the time I I must have admit I do a lot

108
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:39,639
of that right we want to capture the moment um it's okay to do that a little bit but but do we just stop and look do

109
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:46,320
we just see sometimes so there are many people who live in urban areas right which is not a

110
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:56,680
bad thing it's not a bad idea for people to congregate kind of together and leaving wildness more wildness um more

111
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:02,040
Wilderness um Liam says that new psych

112
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:10,320
new work in Psychology reveals that simply the knowledge of flourishing

113
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,199
wild just knowing that there's Wilderness there's wildness positively

114
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:21,880
affects our psychology and creativity and it's this knowledge that

115
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,760
we are called to cultivate daily so Studies have shown that people

116
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,279
in hospitals when they can see out a window and see

117
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:41,920
Greenery their healing accelerates simply the fragrance of

118
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,560
certain trees invokes calm does anybody like if I just say pine pine tree does

119
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,560
anybody can you have a felt sense of that I I

120
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:03,240
do and it brings some calm and recorded nature sounds also do that for us even

121
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:10,160
gazing at a house plant so wherever we are even in a

122
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:18,199
high-rise apartment in the city gaze upon a house PL look out the

123
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:25,920
window step out onto the balcony or onto the rooftop connect with the skies the

124
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:33,600
clouds the Sun the rain the birds in a book called Church of the Wild by

125
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:40,800
Victoria lur she says we long to experience the sacred and in that

126
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,519
longing forget to look outside our window and engage in

127
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:52,160
conversation with a world that is already

128
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,440
sacred but better still but take a walk

129
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,839
outside right in Japan in the early 1980s um Health practitioners started to

130
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:12,880
realize the benefits of walking in nature um shinin Yoku Forest

131
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,600
bathing and um Healthcare practitioners would actually prescribe people to go do

132
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:26,399
Forest bathing and in 2016 Professor Miyazaki compiled all

133
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:33,199
these scientific studies and he said that all of our

134
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:39,079
psychophysiological functions are adapted to Natural outdoor

135
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:47,440
settings he his research showed how walks outside lower blood pressure decrease the heart rate reduce cortisol

136
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,800
production improve blood sugar levels improve immune

137
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,880
function and just overall physiological relaxation

138
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:06,040
just 15 minutes a day Forest Walkers had a 102%

139
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,800
increase in the parasympathetic calming

140
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:18,560
right so it's it's like when we take a deep breath a long slow out breath in

141
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,600
our meditation it activates that parasympathetic nervous system let's just do that right now together

142
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,920
breathing deeply in long slow out breath

143
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,560
how do you feel I feel instantly better I don't know about you it's so

144
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,440
easy um and being outside also helps to do that for our

145
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,680
nervous system it's a way of letting go of releasing daoka

146
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:59,839
suffering so one of the daily practices we were encouraged to do in Eco Chaplan C was to find a sit spot does anybody

147
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:08,400
have a set spot do you know about that no okay so choose a special place

148
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:16,678
outside where you can return to daily for me it's just going out and sitting on my patio out in front of my

149
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:25,400
house get to know the land that you're sitting on get to know

150
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:32,559
the rooted green beings and the for legged and winged

151
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:39,960
beings along with the changing light different times of year the changing

152
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,600
seasons so perhaps you've heard of the term kith and kin and we all know what

153
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,160
kin is and I was like what is kth does anybody know what kth

154
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:57,840
is um it actually means the land where you

155
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,200
are so with the exception of Native

156
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,039
Americans we are a nation of immigrants right whether or not our

157
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:15,039
ancestors or or we chose to come here in search of New

158
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:22,600
Opportunities or came against our will as slaves we are

159
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:30,760
transplants right just like plants from another place we are from somewhere else

160
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,120
and we can feel uprooted and not feeling a sense of

161
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,320
belonging where we are so finding a Sit spot is a way to

162
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:50,200
help us cultivate that feeling of belonging in um the book rooted leanda

163
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:58,360
refers to this as return and be claimed not only do we come to know this

164
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:07,360
place to SI spot but we feel a mutuality of being known to each

165
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,159
other in her book she writes that Linda Mapes who wrote a book called witness

166
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:18,720
tree spent a whole year visiting a single oak tree every

167
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,679
day and she told me she has no doubt that in time the tree recognized her

168
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:34,520
presence that they belong to each other so tick not Han engaged in hugging a

169
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:41,280
spiritual practice when he said when we hug our hearts connect and we know that we are not

170
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,360
separate beings breathing in I know my dear one

171
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,400
is in my arms alive breathing out so

172
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:57,200
precious to me if you do this the tree being hugged

173
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:06,200
will be nourished and Bloom like a flower so on an eapen SE um Richie we

174
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,039
were invited to connect with the tree first asking the tree's

175
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:18,640
permission right we want to be really respectful um and so when we feel that

176
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,360
permission is given perhaps we might simply gaze at the tree we might feel it

177
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,320
spk we might lean against the tree

178
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:37,200
we might wrap our arms around the tree and we might just listen for some

179
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:45,039
wisdom it might have for us so we were in beautiful Redwood

180
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:51,559
forest in the Santa Cruz mountains and there these just just straight up to the

181
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:56,960
sky 100 200 ft these redwood trees and so I was wandering outside trying to

182
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:05,159
find my tree that I was going to connect with and one just caught my

183
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:11,640
interest and I walked over and asked if it was okay if I could connect with

184
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,200
her and I felt it was a yes

185
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:26,960
and this tree was bent was curved over and then it went this way and that

186
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,200
way trying to find the light in this Forest of

187
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:41,279
Giants and I felt such a deep kinship a resonance like how I too in my

188
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:46,520
life right had to bend and twist and

189
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,760
turn trying to find nourishment and and and reach for the

190
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,960
light and for all the twists and turns and Bess and the crookedness of this

191
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:06,559
strong it stood up through the through the storms

192
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:14,200
right and so I thanked her for sharing the wisdom right and her strength and I

193
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:20,159
felt stronger inside of myself for connecting with this beautiful

194
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,520
tree so another practice we might engage in is called earthing I know this is

195
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:32,000
really popular I don't know decades ago maybe in the 70s where you take off your shoes and you put your feet on the on

196
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,880
the ground has anybody done

197
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:44,760
that so we speak of being grounded right for some

198
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:52,880
stability and in terms of electricity right we need that third prong that goes into the the outlet right in case

199
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,559
there's a surge of electricity it actually goes into the ground right

200
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:05,279
right the ground absorbs it so when we place our bare feet on the

201
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:13,120
earth anxiety and stress can flow from us into the

202
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,720
Earth I have done this myself and I've done this with uh people that I know who

203
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:27,039
have been really emotionally disregulated in the middle of a panic

204
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:32,440
attack and it has a very calming

205
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:39,840
effect walking with your feet your bare feet on the ground tick not

206
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,640
Han he's passed away but I I speak of him in the present tense because his

207
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,279
teachings live on tonan invites us through mindful walking to feel that

208
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:56,640
each footstep is kissing the

209
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,679
Earth so in in rooted leanda combines both practices hugging a tree with bare

210
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:12,200
feet she describes the experience with shoes shed we become closer to them the

211
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,720
trees as our mentors putting not just a cheek but an

212
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:25,480
ear directly upon a tree's bark allows deep listening the rhythmic movement of the

213
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:32,520
blood in our bodies the cranial I cranos sacral fluid of our spines and

214
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:39,919
skulls mirrors the movement of sap in the trees the breeze in a rustling hair is

215
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,520
the same as that in the leaves the branches the

216
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:53,399
clouds she also reads to the trees she likes to read Emily Dickinson in

217
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:00,000
particular in the book The Enchanted Life by Sharon Blacky she tells the

218
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,600
story of restoration ecologist suaa sh shashan I'm sorry if I'm

219
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:14,360
mispronouncing that from India who sings as she walks through the

220
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,799
jungle and she says partly because the animal sing so sweetly to me all the

221
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:28,399
time it's their generosity that I aspire to match but singing is also my direct

222
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:35,640
announcement to others in the forest I am here I walk alone I come in

223
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:42,039
peace I believe that singing transmits much more than presence it carries

224
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:48,360
information about the state of my body the state of my emotion and my

225
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,399
intention they can of course choose to stay or leave but usually they are not

226
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:58,919
alarmed and they know it's me the singing woman from the hill

227
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:06,799
so when I sit in meditation sometimes in the morning I'll do some chanting and I've noticed sometimes the

228
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:15,120
birds will get quiet as I chant and I feel somehow I'm singing to

229
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,399
them and then I stop and they start singing and I feel like they're singing

230
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:27,480
to me so we sing to each other or when the Raven cause actually

231
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,799
this happened just before I came here I was sitting outside and there was a raven I think connecting with another

232
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:40,940
one in another tree but I tried to answer [Applause]

233
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:47,679
back although I'm afraid I do not know what I said I'm hoping it wasn't

234
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,399
anything bad because I would love to know Raven language but I

235
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:58,720
don't so there are many ways to connect with our kith and kin and the children

236
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,039
program um the Dharma Sprouts we sing this um Betsy R song that's called

237
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:11,799
breathing in breathing out and we actually meditate also um we the the

238
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:21,039
words go I am blooming as a flower and as we breathe in we open our

239
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,960
flowers fresh as the Dew I am solid as the mountain and the kids put their

240
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,799
hands up over their head heads like a mountain firm as the Earth I'm feeling

241
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:40,440
the Earth firm beneath us I am water reflecting what is real

242
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,679
what is true and I feel there space deep

243
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:53,600
inside of me and I'm free so in Buddhist terms to be

244
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,120
equanimous is to be centered and grounded to feel grounded on the earth

245
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,840
we sit in meditation we're sitting cross-legged like a mountain right we are in the

246
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,159
shape of a mountain wide at the base right smaller at the

247
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:18,320
top feeling at stability and when we sit up

248
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:26,600
right their backbones straight we're like the trunk of a

249
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,320
tree and our breath is like that

250
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:40,919
reflection the Blue Sky reflection right reflecting what

251
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:48,480
is accepting without resistance and we make space inside and

252
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:56,279
around us cultivating peace so there were two very pivotable

253
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:01,480
pivotal experiences of the Buddha on his journey to

254
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:07,640
Enlightenment and he began with um one of them is remembering a time when he

255
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:14,760
was six and he was sitting under a rose apple tree and he could hear the adults in the

256
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:23,679
distance they were doing a ritual tilling of the ground and it said that he sat in

257
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:30,000
seclusion from sensual desire feeling an utter sense of contentment and happiness

258
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:40,360
that came from within himself it wasn't dependent on something outside of himself and yet I cannot help but

259
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:48,000
feel that it was through the five senses that he felt he felt his way into a deep sense

260
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,600
of Peace into samade I imagine this shade of an overarching

261
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:03,480
tree this Rose apple tree keeping him a little cooler as the warmth from the Sun lulled

262
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:10,399
him and the apple blossom so beautifully blooming I can imagine

263
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:19,640
looking through the branches of the tree up to the blue sky and the smell of the apple

264
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:25,360
blossoms hearing the hum of the insects and the chirping of

265
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,519
birds feeling the firm ground beneath his

266
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:39,039
body another pivotal moment was sitting under the bod tree and he committed to staying there

267
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,840
until he achieved Enlightenment so Mara sends all kinds of

268
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:52,640
things enticements and fears armies of demons and terrible

269
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,279
storms and finally the final Challenge on this path to Enlightenment

270
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:05,120
with self-doubt who do you think you are to become

271
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,399
enlightened right the Buddha did not answer with

272
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,639
words he simply reached down and touched the

273
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:25,760
Earth and the Earth affirmed his worthiness as each one of us is equally

274
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:34,519
worthy to become enlightened so nature teaches us so many

275
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:41,360
things one of the most important is non-judgmental awareness right that is like the basic definition of

276
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:48,600
mindfulness it is an unselfconscious

277
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:55,480
beingness right nature teaches us that right no matter how we come in into

278
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:01,880
nature nature that we are going out into nature no matter how well-dressed or

279
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:08,519
bare skinned we are right whether we are sad or we're

280
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:15,480
anxious we are um bathed or we don't smell good

281
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,399
right we are not shamed or shunned we're just part of nature just another

282
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:29,840
animal if we are respectful we are welcome we are not separate

283
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:37,039
right and in our connections with Mother Nature we begin to feel this

284
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:43,720
appreciation this gratitude love in braiding sweet grass Robin wal

285
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:50,279
Kimmer writes knowing that you love the Earth changes you activates you to

286
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:56,960
defend and protect and celebrate but when you feel that the

287
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,080
Earth loves you you in return that feeling transforms a

288
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:11,120
relationship from a one-way Street into a sacred Bond the land loves us back she loves us

289
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:17,720
with beans and tomatoes with roasting ears of corn and blackberries and bird

290
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:24,159
songs by a shower of gifts and a heavy rain of lessons she provides for us and

291
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,320
teaches us to provide for ourselves that's what good mothers

292
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:37,440
do so in reclaiming the wild Soul by Mary Reynolds Thompson she says if we

293
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:44,919
don't reclaim and come to love our inner wildness how much more of the Earth's

294
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:53,639
wild places will we be willing to destroy let the great rewilding of our

295
00:33:53,639 --> 00:34:01,159
world begin with you with me with all of us whoever we

296
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:08,079
are wherever we live no matter our ethnicity our sex our religion political

297
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:14,118
affiliation nationality we are all children of this

298
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:21,800
Earth and when we climb up to a mountain or we fly up in an airplane we look down

299
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:28,599
upon the Land There are no map lines right

300
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:34,878
and if we are able to escape Earth's gravity we will find ourselves in the

301
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:40,480
Blackness of outer space looking back at the

302
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,560
Earth only astronauts have had this perspective and they have brought back

303
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,000
pictures when a particular Earth rise I'm sure everybody's seen that beautiful

304
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,599
picture of the Earth from the Moon and they' brought back accounts

305
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:06,200
personal accounts of how this moved them so deeply and in the words of one astronaut

306
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:12,119
Edgar Mitchell suddenly from behind the rim of

307
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:17,640
the Moon in long slow motion moments of

308
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:23,119
immense Majesty there emerges a sparkling blue

309
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,839
and white Jewel a light delicate sky High blue

310
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:36,000
sphere laced with slowly swirling veils of white Rising gradually like a small

311
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,160
Pearl in a thick sea of black mystery it takes more than a moment to

312
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:48,079
fully realize this is Earth

313
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:56,079
home so may we all know ourselves as one

314
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,640
family with a deep deep love and appreciation for kith and

315
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,960
Ken knowing that only do we Earth love the Earth but the Earth loves us

316
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:14,680
back and may we save the Earth save what we

317
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:24,920
love so thank you for your attention and now we have um

318
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:31,319
some time for questions and for Reflections and

319
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:36,400
for connecting with each other about how this may have landed for you and what

320
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,599
comes up for you

321
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:47,760
so do anybody have anything they want to share or any

322
00:36:52,760 --> 00:37:00,319
questions or how how this might feel in your body and your

323
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:20,480
heart and I also want to invite people to um one thing that I like to do

324
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,680
sometimes is to invite people into small groups of three or so if you want to

325
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:32,520
really feel a deeper connection with sa and Community if that feels something

326
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:39,960
that you'd like to do maybe you could gather into groups of three and then just share you know how was this for you

327
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:47,800
and then we can come back together and see what came up for you so feel free to do that say hi introduce yourself and

328
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:53,640
we'll come back in about 10 minutes if you want to come back to our

329
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:59,440
larger Circle I I'd love to hear you know a few shares uh about what came up

330
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,720
for

331
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:12,800
you all like as well Jim here works for NASA so

332
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,920
perhaps I can help you I'm too claustrophobic frankly to go

333
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,160
up knowing me and $5 will get you a cup of

334
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:32,560
coffee it used to be 25 sense but

335
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:42,160
oh I actually have I got it for one of my kids um who loves astronauts and

336
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:48,839
things that are base oriented and I have a poster of earthrise that is signed by

337
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:54,560
Edgar Mitchell there's something is very special about I don't know I kind of put

338
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:01,160
my hand on the signature it's like wow this person has actually been you know in space looking back at

339
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,480
Earth whoa

340
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,559
special yeah oh do you want the microphone

341
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:29,119
yeah yeah

342
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,560
online testing oh yeah I think one of the things we talked about and or I

343
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,920
certainly shared a lot about um this word alienation and the

344
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,480
example I think it comes up for a lot of us but just how disconnected we are

345
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:53,319
from uh nature is one of them but like it could be from each other things that we do and so I thought

346
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:59,560
of the kind of Supermarket I'm going there later but just how many things we take for granted

347
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,920
that like we don't know where the source is necessarily or you know of the food

348
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:11,960
the process food anything I mean when so we partition things we're like oh this is water this is bottled and it's here

349
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,599
and you buy it like we create these extra things and um so a lot of the

350
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:24,680
exercises and just thinking about and connecting Back To Nature makes you kind of realize like

351
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:30,200
kind of how roundabout it is that we we do all these things to like repurpose it

352
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:36,960
or sell it back to each other things like that so it was

353
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:45,000
a you can never overthink that I think yeah and I love the way um when we

354
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,920
do um a blessing on food when we think about the

355
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:58,599
interconnectedness like when we're actually taking in nourishment

356
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:05,720
like how many how much there is that we are taking in Tak on H and I loved how

357
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,760
he's with this with his interbeing um teachings you know talks

358
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,960
about with every bite of food we're taking in the soil the food grew in and

359
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,680
the Sun and the clouds and the rain and all of and the farmers and the Farm

360
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:28,480
Workers and the people the truck drivers and the store people at the store and pretty soon it's like oh my gosh who

361
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:36,160
wasn't involved with this right we're so interdependent it's amazing um and the

362
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,119
thing that I love too about um really focusing on on putting our

363
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:48,079
attention on food is that and I used to think about this Earth as being kind of

364
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:54,040
like a nightmare of everything trying to eat everything else you know whether it's plants or animals I mean it's like

365
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:01,920
we're eating each other it's like oh that's awful and then I thought no wait a minute it

366
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:08,920
it's like it's a Sacrament it is a a gifting of life to each other like when

367
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,960
I eat the strawberry it's like it was a seed and it grew and it got plump and

368
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:19,160
red and juicy and then it got picked and

369
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:26,920
then I take it in right and it's a strawberry that's gifted its life to me

370
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:34,160
and I am now taking it in and it becomes part of me to nourish myself it's like

371
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:40,040
wow you know I me some people talk about sacralizing you know making sacred you

372
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:46,240
know everyday life and when we really stop to think about it

373
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:53,000
um it's hard not to right thank you for that share any

374
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,119
anything else one one one share maybe or

375
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:16,960
or not if but I I do want to finish with I I've got this poem that um is called

376
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:25,079
No Matter What by Kai sidenberg from a a book of poems poems of Earth and

377
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:32,240
spirit no matter how hard they try they cannot keep us apart they can pour

378
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:38,960
concrete over the rich dark Earth put us in a plastic chair inside a sheetrock

379
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:45,839
box hook us up to electronic devices and tell us we have to stay there all day

380
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:52,480
and still we will be breathing the breath of towering Pines growing on

381
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,800
rugged Mountain slopes and Tiny green Plankton floating in dis

382
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:05,240
seas and even though the water we drink travels through many miles of pipe is doused with chlorine and maybe contain

383
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:10,440
in plastic bottles still we will be drinking water

384
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:16,480
that has tumbled over Granite Boulders hibernated in frozen lakes and reflected

385
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,280
The Morning Sun from a spider's web and even though the salad weed may

386
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:30,240
be grown hundreds of miles away harvested and washed by hands we will never sea and packaged in a plastic

387
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:36,640
box still we will be eating leaves from plants whose Roots embrace the Fertile

388
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,839
Earth as their tender green bodies reach toward the light and no matter how

389
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:47,160
relentlessly we have been trained to sit still to hold our tongues to follow the

390
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:54,720
rules even when they make no sense still we are animals of Flesh and Blood kin to

391
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:02,400
Deer bear and whale with deep wisdom in our bones and Untamed passions in our

392
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:09,800
hearts still there's a wild one inside us running Barefoot through the forest Gathering sweet berries dancing around

393
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:19,599
the fire singing To The Moon so I hope that we will

394
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,800
be more mindfully bodily

395
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,520
connected to the Earth to the

396
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:39,440
cosmos and that we will really love this Earth and do all we can

397
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:48,240
to save the planet from more desecration and um with

398
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:54,280
hopefulness right with hopefulness we can do it we just need

399
00:45:54,280 --> 00:46:02,040
the to come together right and um so thank you so much for your

400
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:08,559
coming this evening for your practice and take good care

401
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:14,359
and hope to see you soon
