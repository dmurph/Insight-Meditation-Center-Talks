5
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:36,399
for today's practice i'd like to invite us to to um

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,440
work with metta cultivating metal heart cultivating good will

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,239
cultivating uh meta and compassion as well as

8
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,640
um vicarious joy which becomes gratitude when we practice for

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,160
ourselves so as well as a little bit of equanimity all of these four brahmaviharas

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,400
practice all of those for ourselves with the support of

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,560
our metta mentor so today the theme is

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,360
cultivation with the support of a meta mentor okay so

13
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,520
so this meta mentor of ours is

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:35,280
someone it could be our inner buddha for some of you might be in your inner buddha that that you whip out comes out

15
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:43,040
and ah yes looks at you with eyes of care and love and just seize all of your

16
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:50,640
beauty all of your goodness all of your quirks all of the ways you struggle

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,560
and loves you completely completely so your meta mentor could be a buddha it

18
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,960
could be kuan yin for some of you you have a connection with kuan yin the embodiment of of compassion so so she

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,479
might be the one oh yes holding you for some of you might be a friend a dear

20
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,560
friend or a mentor or a coach or

21
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,400
or your fairy godmother you can imagine or

22
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,800
um a parent or or an angel an angelic being who is

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,280
full of goodness so whatever whoever whoever this meta

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,360
mentor just take a moment perhaps and conjure up for yourself and you can

25
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,800
switch later it's not good to switch too many times but if if one doesn't work later in the meditation you can switch

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,920
and choose another but but conjure up this being this being

27
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,200
whether imagined someone archetypal or being from your

28
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,560
life alive or disease doesn't matter as long as the deceased doesn't bring off

29
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,319
grief and sadness someone or maybe again is imaginary being who

30
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,319
sees you completely sees you and loves you unconditionally

31
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,440
this is your your quote-unquote flaws your challenges your

32
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,159
goodness your intention and just wants the best for you what's the best

33
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,680
for you seize your goodness so this will be your meta mentor

34
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,840
your meta mentor and come on this is imaginary right so

35
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,760
how hard is it to imagine someone of course it could be challenging i don't want to belittle this this this

36
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,879
challenge also that some of us might have but but really conjuring up someone yeah and

37
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,640
again if it's hard to think of a personal meta mentor think

38
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,239
of kuan yin think of the buddha maybe jesus maybe the being of light whoever

39
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,959
you connect with it's it's okay for this practice it's perfectly okay

40
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,440
so so with that let's begin our practice

41
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,239
and i'll have invitations throughout

42
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,840
ah so as always we land we land in our bodies

43
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,759
we land in this moment

44
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,639
connecting with the breath

45
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:09,160
the felt sense of the body connected to the earth with each breath

46
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,440
and i'd like to invite you to connect with your meta mentor

47
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,919
as described inviting this being this compassionate being

48
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,280
to your heart into your mind's eye into your space

49
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:54,000
this being either from your life or

50
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,599
this archetypal being your inner buddha

51
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:09,919
kuan yin being of light jesus mother mary

52
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,759
her friend or a coach very friendly

53
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,240

54
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,199
or metta fairy godmother conjuring up whoever

55

works for you inviting them inviting them and letting yourself be held

56
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,280
in their gaze taking some time to stabilize

57
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,039
still connecting with the breath and the body

58
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,839
letting yourself be held

59
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,160

circumstances may not be ideal in your heart

76
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,720
in your life in your mind your body

77
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,160
may not be what you wish for

78
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:09,160
or you would have chosen this moment in time

79
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,639
now this being this being understands understands the challenges

without judgment

83
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,000

their understanding [Music] the unconditionality

85
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,558
of their good will is healing soothing

86
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,880
comforting gives you more

87

90
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,919
held in their care with this difficulty whatever it is

91

this challenge

92
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,919
see if you can ask them a question

93
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,059
if they have [Music]

94
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:37,440
some wisdom words of wisdom with care and love they have for you

95
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,480
that can support you through this difficulty

96
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,400
if you're putting your question gently offering putting it on the altar

97
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,559
asking is there something

98
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,960
i'm just listening there might be something there might be nothing

99
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,360
and the answer might just come in the form of

100
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:21,039
care warmth meta compassion maybe that's all that's needed

101
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,279
no words

102
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,919
let your body your heart be soft

103
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,159

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,640
nicholas please

160
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:24,240
um yeah i i appreciated the the meta mentor

161
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,280
because being held in compassion

162
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,280
from the meta mentor helped me see

163
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,480
i don't see compassion as mine but i do see presence or absence of compassion as

164
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,839
my responsibility and so you know when compassion is not

165
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:51,280
available there's a certain attitude of failure that this needs to be fixed

166
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,620
and i think i hadn't i hadn't noticed that clearly and so this sit was very tender um

167
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:02,000
[Music] because it was very tender to sit in that space of compassion doesn't isn't

168
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,280
really felt in this moment and what does it mean that that's not my

169
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,160
fault that was a very tender place for me to sit

170
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:20,720
hmm i feel so moved nicholas

171

172
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:33,280
yes it is not my fault if there is if compassion is not arising in this moment it is the challenge in

173

this moment and for it to be seen with eyes of compassion oh

let us turn to practice in small groups size three

199
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:31,359
roughly and sharing with each other well always as always we'll start with 15 seconds of

200
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:38,400
silent meta and there's so much that we can gain from each other

201
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:44,079
from um what came up for us from our meta mentor

202
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:49,119
words of wisdom or the challenges that we sat with with

203
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:56,400
tenderness it's all invited it's all invited

204
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:04,079
so taking the first 15 seconds with silence for yourself or

205
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:09,680
others with meta with compassion and then sharing as little or as much as

206
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:16,079
you wish so here are the rooms they are created and take care of

207
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,760

00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,880
virtuous cycle instead of a vicious cycle becomes a virtuous cycle of smiling giving and
