1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,059
okay thanks to everyone for checking in it's always nice to

2
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:17,220
hear where you are and see you there but now we'll go ahead and get started

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,560
so settling in for meditation together

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,660
you can see in the chat all the folks that are joining us

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,160
and just allow yourself to be in the shape that you're in

6
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,559
closing your eyes if that's comfortable

7
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,739
and just softening the body into the meditation posture that you're using

8
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:54,440
today perhaps feeling the contact of your

9
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,780
seats with the chair or the cushion

10
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,460
or whatever you're lying on or maybe you're standing

11
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,979
just sensing the support beneath you

12
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,619
foreign

13
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:28,619
slow deep breaths and on the exhale just allowing the body

14
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,119
to settle in a bit more

15
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:47,118
we're taking in just the sense of the whole body

16
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,680
in whatever posture it's in

17
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,300
and gently softening softening the expression on the base

18
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,459
softening the eyes and the eyes of its

19
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:25,940
can even soften all the little muscles on the scalp foreign

20
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,140
allowing the shoulders to be soft

21
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,319
letting the shoulder blades slide down the back

22
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:19,140
checking in Into the Heart area scenting if there's any tension or

23
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,599
tightness ache

24
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:31,340
if there is that's fine but just inviting a softening

25
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,280
letting the rib cage relax

26
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,620
all the way down into the belly area

27
00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:00,060
maybe on the in-breath imagining drawing the air down even below the lungs all

28
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:07,640
the way to fill the belly area into the lower abdomen

29
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,060
letting the hip joints soften

30
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:28,460
down into the thighs the knee joints

31
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,960
and all the way to the feet

32
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,699
and then returning to the sense of uprightness and with some initial

33
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:50,220
softening and ease seeing if that allows the spine to

34
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:57,120
straighten up a bit more softness leads to a deeper kind of

35
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,660
strength

36
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,560
feeling the body supported through the middle

37
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,120
and soft around that

38
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,979
men in the mind

39
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:39,319
bringing awareness mindfulness to the four

40
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:49,940
sense of being here present for our experience

41
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:02,039
and that provides the stability and the strength in the mind and everything around that can be soft

42
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:07,400
letting the thoughts be soft letting

43
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:14,479
emotional Energies just flow in the background

44
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,660
letting mindfulness be the spine of the Mind

45
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,600
we can notice that there's a certain feeling of ease

46
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:02,520
when there is awareness in the present moment even if what's going on in the rest of

47
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,600
experiences something uncomfortable

48
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,060
something in the body or something in the art

49
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,780
the simple fact that there's mindfulness of it that there's presence actually has a slight amount of joy and

50
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,400
ease associated with it

51
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:33,080
and we can tune into that as kind of a reference point

52
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:41,300
that feeling of simple ease when the mind is mindful

53
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:05,840
so the invitation is to use ease as the reference point

54
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:17,340
some part of the body that's at ease and the ease of presence in the mind

55
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:23,900
as the reference point something that we Orient around

56
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,260
you know when the mind is entangled in a thought or an emotion or

57
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:41,279
some reaction to the body we can feel how that's complicated not

58
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:47,880
useful and return to the reference point of

59
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,500
just useful awareness of the flow of the present moment

60
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,760
foreign

61
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,920
foreign

62
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,959
foreign

63
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:04,079
has become complicated and the body has tensed up

64
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:11,360
because of thinking or entanglement just gently

65
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:20,180
re-prioritizing ease as the reference point the ease of staying simple

66
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,660
just being aware of what's happening in the present moment

67
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,079
softening the body

68
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,420
and if there are parts of the body that are painful or tight then there's mental

69
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:49,459
ease around how the body is it's fine right now

70
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,220
foreign

71
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,259
foreign

72
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:19,260
and if you are finding that there is some degree of ease

73
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,980
compared to when you started they sit

74
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:34,460
just allowing that to continue infusing into the body and mind

75
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:43,080
noticing what happens if you just open to the possibility of

76
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,840
ease or peace or contentment

77
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,899
whatever word seems to work

78
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,120
sometimes we can be surprised to find resistance

79
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,419
to ease

80
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:20,960
like it's not quite allowed or not quite right or might harm us

81
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,419
I don't know we can just have ease with our resistance

82
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:30,740
it is interesting

83
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,340
and as we move toward the end of this sitting

84
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:06,179
we might just open the mind to some gentle reflection

85
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:13,020
now would there be some way that carrying a reference point of

86
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:19,940
ease and presence and peace in some way

87
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:27,720
could help with letting go of the various

88
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,760
things that come up during the day

89
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,580
what are we willing to give up our peace for

90
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:51,679
we've finally gotten the puppy quiet a little bit

91
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:58,760
original let it lunge out and run around

92
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:06,299
I suppose that's what puppies do maybe that's what our mind will do

93
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:13,620
but maybe there's some unnecessary running around and lunging after things

94
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:20,840
that our mind tends to do where we could just say no thank you

95
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,039
it's fine just being present

96
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,120
we might find that this is supportive for other people too

97
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:52,620
not participating in the often

98
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:57,779
escalations that happen as each person gets more and more excited and

99
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:03,778
entrenched in their view or opinion

100
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:09,779
to seeing if that might be supportive this reference point of

101
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:13,760
being your ears in some way

102
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,980
foreign

103
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,069
[Music]

104
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:12,899
so this week we are talking about seven practices

105
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:20,120
that lead to letting go and recall that letting go is

106
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:26,039
multi-dimensional you know sometimes we actively engage sometimes we watch

107
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:32,460
sometimes we have some agency but often we don't really control the actual Act

108
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:38,279
of Letting Go we just do these practices and then the Letting Go occurs when and

109
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:44,700
how it does so a very important way of letting go or

110
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:51,000
factor in the process of letting go is seeing that was the what we talked about

111
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,200
yesterday and we talked about it in the context of noticing whether wholesome states are

112
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,020
increasing or unwholesome states are increasing and then redirecting what we

113
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:11,460
pay attention to or how we're paying attention if needed in order to support the mind

114
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:18,120
staying in a more wholesome condition so this method from yesterday actually

115
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:25,320
weaves through all of the other six methods because we often have to check if we're moving to Warrior away from

116
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:31,200
suffering so in a sense this seeing that we talked about first is actually the most

117
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,360
fundamental way of letting go and clear scene

118
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:42,419
provides the discernment needed for all of the other methods

119
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:49,080
and we actually didn't completely finish talking about seeing so I'll probably say a little bit more about it on Friday

120
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:56,220
since it's so fundamental but for now we'll move on to some other

121
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:03,960
ways and the next few that we'll talk about apply in particular domains of

122
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:11,220
experience so I think yesterday I said you know if it's a glass jar we would open it by

123
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:17,039
turning the cap and if it's an aluminum can we need a can opener and so forth

124
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,279
so today's method is called restraining

125
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:29,700
and it comes out of seeing actually if we see that unwholesome states are

126
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:36,419
repeatedly occurring when we do certain actions then we might wish to restrain

127
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:41,460
from doing those actions that would help right that would help our mind

128
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:48,299
so the teachings say that there are cases where we will experience taints

129
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:53,640
vexation and fever if we don't have restraint

130
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:59,880
um and I think we're actually all familiar with what it feels like when we

131
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:06,299
could have had more restraint and sometimes that can be kind of painful right

132
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:12,658
so what we're actually restraining is the compulsion that leads

133
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:18,720
the Mind down a path toward Duca I don't know why the mind sometimes wants to go

134
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:26,398
toward Duca that seems to be one of the problems we inherit as a human being and so there's this compulsion sometimes and

135
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:31,560
so we want to restrain that part of the mind that is you know running in the

136
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,599
wrong direction for our own care right so

137
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:44,280
there are three domains maybe to pay attention to um one would be compulsive actions or

138
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:51,118
you know so like eating that third piece of pie and this isn't sort of an obvious one

139
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,460
you know as we sit there after the third piece feeling bloated and with an

140
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:03,080
amazing Sugar High we might be experiencing taints vexation and fever

141
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:10,560
associated with not having quite enough restraint so I think in that case the the

142
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,720
terminology we can get a sort of a visceral feeling with that

143
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:24,599
um and then of course there's the area of speech so I knew someone once who was working

144
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:30,960
on refraining from complaining and I was impressed that you know she took this on

145
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,480
and over a several week period She tried not to complain either verbally or

146
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,060
mentally um and what she discovered uh and it

147
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:48,599
wasn't so much whether she was going to succeed 100 or not because that would be very difficult but it was like a

148
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:55,680
learning experience you know you put down the the idea okay not gonna not gonna complain and then see what happens

149
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,859
with that like observe how the mind is and she discovered that complaining has

150
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:08,339
a compulsive side to it and she would um you know come to mindfulness in the

151
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:14,400
middle of complaining sometimes it was afterwards but as she got better at it she would become mindful in the act of

152
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:21,780
complaining in the middle of it and she would realize she realized that she couldn't stop and in her words I chose

153
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:27,000
not to stop because it felt too good in the moment but afterward it did not feel

154
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,180
good at all so it's like this with complaining it feels so good while we're doing it I'm

155
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:38,339
gonna sock it to that thing that I'm complaining about

156
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:45,960
um and it feels really good for a moment and then but if there's mindfulness he realized doesn't feel so good to put the

157
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,060
mind in a state like that so there's an interesting practice you

158
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:56,339
know could we restrain in some way before we put

159
00:36:56,339 --> 00:37:01,520
ourselves into that not good feeling like before we have the third piece of pie

160
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,900
so there's an interesting practice I've heard about and used when practicing

161
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:13,760
with restraint in the verbal Realm and it's a it's an acronym uh weight

162
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,160
w-a-i-t and it stands for why am I talking

163
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:27,420
so I recommend this um you know when the mind is thinking about saying something you just

164
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,700
insert weight why am I talking and maybe it's fine maybe what you're saying is

165
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:41,220
useful or helpful or even compassionate maybe it's even Fierce Compassion or favorite uh you know but

166
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:48,119
um maybe not and so maybe just putting in that question we might realize

167
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:55,320
whether or not what we're saying is something that we really want to say would really be useful and helpful and

168
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,859
contribute to the situation foreign

169
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:06,119
area that we tend to have compulsion there's actions in speech and then

170
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:12,780
there's also thought you know we do have very much I think if you're a meditator you know you have compulsive thought so

171
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:19,800
the tendency to just keep chewing over a memory or a fear or an anxiety about

172
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:26,220
something and if we repeatedly think about some topic and get upset could we

173
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:35,880
choose to restrain that train of thought or even at the subtle level of remind there can be ways of restraining that I

174
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:42,300
mean there's lots and lots of them out there so there's another area where we can't talk through all of that but

175
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:48,240
um you know there there's the possibility of switching the line to something that's and what's called an

176
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:54,359
antidote so you know if we are complaining a lot could we switch to meta some kind of appreciation or

177
00:38:54,359 --> 00:39:01,740
gratitude uh for what for some other aspect of what's going on instead of part that we're complaining about

178
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:07,140
another thing we can do is deliberately reflect on the suffering that comes from

179
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:13,619
such thoughts you know before ruminating on something and if we are stuck in the

180
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:20,760
topic of the rumination the mind is removed from the present moment actually it's in a concept and if we actually

181
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:27,420
feel in the body uh how how much suffering there is associated with those thoughts sometimes

182
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:32,520
that's enough that the mind is like oh I don't wanna I don't want to be doing that

183
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:39,660
so you know there's a number of ways that we can do this I've I've mentioned some internal ones but it's worth

184
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:48,000
mentioning that the Buddha does talk about where ways that there can be external restraints uh in our life you

185
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,900
know we don't have to just sort of knuckle under and take it on as I gotta do everything internally

186
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:00,780
um there was the case of a new monk named magia and

187
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:07,500
um the Buddha gave him some suggestions to help settle his mind and stop thinking compulsively and some of them

188
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,900
were external so the the story is probably something that we can relate to

189
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:18,480
um McGill was serving for a while as the Buddhas attended and so he was hanging

190
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,839
out with the Buddha and there came a time when you know it was meditation time in the afternoon and he said can I

191
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:29,880
go meditate by myself in that mango Grove and the the Buddha kind of

192
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:36,420
discouraged him and he said nah that might not be such a good idea for you mcia but he he was really determined and

193
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:42,240
he asked again and again the Buddha said maybe not but he was so determined and he said no

194
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,760
please I'm really devoted I really want to go meditate in the mango Grove and so it would have said all right what can I

195
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:57,660
do it's about meditation go for it and so he went there and he um sat down for the day's

196
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:03,839
meditation if you will and the suta says but while McGill was meditating in that

197
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:10,380
mango Grove he was beset very badly by three kinds of unskillful

198
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:17,520
thoughts namely sensual malicious and cruel thoughts and then he thought it's

199
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:25,200
incredible it's amazing I've gone forth from the laylife into homelessness out of Faith but I'm still harassed by these

200
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:31,380
three kinds of bad unskillful thoughts sensual malicious and cruel thoughts so

201
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:37,859
you know here it is we've become we're not monastics but we've taken on a spiritual practice of mindfulness and

202
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:45,180
we're sitting down meditating so well and lo and behold all these terrible thoughts come and what I love is that

203
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:50,700
Mickey doesn't say oh I'm so bad he says it's incredible it's amazing how could

204
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:56,160
this happen so it was sort of genuine wonder he went back to the Buddha and he

205
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:03,500
said this is what happened to me and so then the Buddha took this as an opportunity to teach him and he said

206
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:09,599
when the hearts release is not ripe there are things that can help it to

207
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,880
ripen and he names a whole bunch of them but I'll just name a few

208
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,880
he says good friends Companions and Associates this is the first thing that

209
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,839
can help your heart to ripen so Sangha friends companions talk sitting with

210
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:34,260
people being in a group that's also practicing very supportive for a mind

211
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,839
that is harassed what does it say beset so that sounds like taints vexation and

212
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:46,260
fever be set by difficult thoughts and then second he says um

213
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:53,700
uh one can be ethical conducting oneself well and associating the suitable people and so

214
00:42:53,700 --> 00:43:01,079
forth and so then there's there's a way of course that is sort of an individual effort but ethics are relational so you

215
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:08,520
know getting people around us who will also be ethical and will help support us in why speech in Wise actions this can

216
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:14,040
be very very helpful and then also the Buddha says to Makia

217
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:20,339
it's very helpful when a person gets to take part in talk about self-effacement

218
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:26,700
that helps open the heart whenever they want without trouble or difficulty and then he says more

219
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:33,900
specifically talk about fewness of wishes contentment seclusion arousing

220
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:40,319
energy ethics concentration wisdom freedom and knowledge and vision

221
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:45,660
so these are you know lofty Dharma topics but the chance to talk about the

222
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:51,359
Dharma is also an external support that we can use that restrains the Mind from

223
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:56,819
running off into difficult thoughts and restrains us from difficult verbal

224
00:43:56,819 --> 00:44:02,579
behavior and and actions so it is it can be useful to have some good support

225
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:08,579
around us if our mind is in need of restraint in some ways

226
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:13,800
and then we can see that also how we do the

227
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:20,220
restraining matters so um for example if there's a text where

228
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:25,380
someone is supposed to evaluate whether or not a teacher is good for them and

229
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:32,099
one thing they're supposed to check is whether it looks like the teacher is restrained without fear not restrained

230
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:39,000
by fear so is a person who's you know leading a

231
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,579
group uh restraining by fear of them you know there's themselves or are they

232
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:49,980
making others comply out of fear or is it a natural kind of internal restraint

233
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:55,260
so restraint by fear is not what we're looking for we don't restrain ourselves because

234
00:44:55,260 --> 00:45:00,740
we're terrified of the consequences we restrain ourselves because

235
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:07,079
there's ease we have a basis of ease we know that it's more useful that way

236
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:12,900
in the dalapada there's a chapter that opens with a rather remarkable stanza it

237
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:20,520
says if one knew oneself to be precious one would guard oneself with care a sage

238
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:27,119
will watch over herself in any part of the night so we restrain ourselves because we know

239
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:34,619
how valuable we are we watch over ourselves in a protective way because we matter our inner life

240
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:40,020
matters our heart matters so I've noticed that here in the west it

241
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:45,540
can take some time for people to begin valuing themselves we may have

242
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:51,420
internalized a lot of criticism so we don't really like ourselves or we might have learned that it's better to take

243
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:58,140
care of everyone else and not ourselves but at some point we have to make our own well-being a real part of the path

244
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:05,520
and that includes restraining the parts of our Behavior speech and thought that are unwholesome because that harms us

245
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,560
so it comes down to our heart our cheetah

246
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,839
our heart lined so we're a little over so I'll just end

247
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:23,640
with the Buddha says I do not see even one other thing that when tamed guarded

248
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:30,599
protected and restrained lead to such great good as the cheetah the heart the

249
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:37,020
cheetah maintained guarded protected and restrained leads to great good

250
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:42,839
so this is a healthy helpful movement the cheetah is our emotional Center and

251
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:48,180
it starts out in tangle with all kinds of bad habits it's been kind of beat up

252
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:53,640
and so then through Dharma practice we disentangle it unfold it and it becomes

253
00:46:53,640 --> 00:47:01,079
free but at the beginning we have to protect it like a Little Seedling and restraining is part of that protecting

254
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:06,300
process so when we restrain compulsion it

255
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:12,599
becomes less compulsive you know its energy gets weaker and eventually those habits really don't sway the heart

256
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:17,819
anymore and so we become happier and lighter so restraint can lead to letting

257
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:24,800
go in Freedom all right so thank you
