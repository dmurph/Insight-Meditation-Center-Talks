1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,200
okay so why don't we go ahead and start as people are continuing to

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,759
trickle in and I while people were arriving I

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,800
commented on how long it's been somebody wrote it's been since April 2020 so

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:26,720
that's right around the beginning of the pandemic i think it's nice now and then to

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,960
reflect on the value of connecting with other people in our practice and the

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,200
support that we gain from meditating together in a group even if we're not

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,480
physically in the same room i think for some that's been a real discovery maybe

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:53,120
some weren't surprised by that the dharma doesn't really have a place and a time but nonetheless it does

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,559
matter so carrying that with us let's begin our

10
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,280
meditation together closing the eyes if that's comfortable

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,760
for you and finding a posture for sitting or you could be lying down or

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,760
standing

13
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,439
maybe taking a long slow deep breath

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,720
and on the outreath just softening in a bit to the position

15
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,119
that you're in whatever posture your body feels is good for you today for

16
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,360
this sit

17
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,079
and inviting some ease in the body which is always possible even if there's

18
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:57,680
pain or illness we can invite just a sense of being at

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,600
home so perhaps

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,679
bringing attention into the face and just softening the expression on the

21
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,040
face softening the eyes and the eye sockets

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,680
sensing into the head area and just inviting some

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:40,040
calming some easing any thinking that might be going on

24
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:50,040
not that there's anything wrong with thinking but just making it softer

25
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,319
down through the jaw and the neck

26
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:10,879
bringing some attention to the shoulder area maybe letting the shoulder blades slide

27
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,280
down the back

28
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,280
releasing the arms

29
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,440
letting the chest area and all the way down into the belly

30
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,640
just letting that be itself

31
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,799
how we do this right now

32
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,680
softening the low back area

33
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,680
sensing where the hips and seat are resting

34
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,840
you're in the sitting posture and then down through the legs softening

35
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,360
any bracing that might be there

36
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,880
in a way we're just trusting the body to be as it is

37
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:51,759
by touching it with the attention we let it know that we're here

38
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,160
we see it

39
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,600
and that begins to bring into the mind the simple awareness that we call

40
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
mindfulness

41
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,960
knowing things clearly without demanding that they be a certain

42
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,960
way

43
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,960
knowing them as they are

44
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,080
and then for the process of meditation it is helpful to

45
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:55,560
intentionally choose something to orient around often people use the breath

46
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:05,000
but if that isn't so right for you you can use body sensations or sounds

47
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,880
these are present moment objects

48
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,479
and I find that when I use the breath for example

49
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:36,400
it's kind of just a touchstone and I can still sense the flow of thoughts

50
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,400
emotions [Music] i do still hear sounds

51
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,919
but I'm breathing along with all of those things

52
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,479
mindfulness isn't really exclusive

53
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:10,599
but it is a way of orienting so we're not just following anything that happens

54
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,080
so the invitation the invitation in this sit

55
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:40,240
is to have a simple intention of being simple is that when the mind

56
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,319
gets complicated It gets lost in its thoughts or

57
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:54,440
fantasies memories and we notice that we simply return

58
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:03,520
and the support for that also an invitation is to bring in a brief acknowledgement

59
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,599
that we are all doing this together there are actually hundreds of people

60
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,440
around the globe doing this sit

61
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,720
so without adding any complexity just remembering

62
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:30,840
that we're doing this together and see how that goes with simple mindfulness

63
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,040
gently present with our own experience

64
00:12:52,639 --> 00:13:00,399
and yet a small part of awareness attuned to

65
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,079
being part of this larger group

66
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:14,600
how does that feel as we continue to stay with the flow of our own experience

67
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:26,840
the instructions for mindfulness meditation are actually quite simple

68
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,720
and they've worked for countless people

69
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,280
over millennia

70
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,360
we are not an exception to this rule

71
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,320
these lines are from the dharmapata

72
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:59,440
think not lightly of good saying it will not come to me

73
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,679
drop by drop is the water pot filled

74
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:13,360
likewise the wise one gathering it little by little

75
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,120
fills oneself with good

76
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,360
breath by breath moment by moment

77
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
the mind gathers goodness clarity

78
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:44,640
strength from doing this practice that so many have done and so many are doing

79
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,440
together right now

80
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,520
[Music]

81
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:07,720
[Music]

82
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,720
and moving toward the end of our sit together

83
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,559
we can begin to bring the mind

84
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:22,120
toward thinking about our life out in the world

85
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:30,840
and really there it's the same mind

86
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,480
we can continue with the simple trust in

87
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,840
mindfulness and wholesomeness

88
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:51,360
this kind of trust is not about blindly following instructions or rules or

89
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:59,398
creating algorithms that might not be so wise

90
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,880
but we know that we can trust in the eight-fold path because we've seen for

91
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,200
oursel that it's beneficial

92
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:19,919
to whatever degree you've practiced and everyone here has now practiced at

93
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,759
least 30 minutes of mindfulness

94
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:32,799
we can see that there's something beneficial there that's the basis

95
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:38,520
for trusting in mindfulness and wholesomeness

96
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:44,880
so that means doing actions like wise speech

97
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:52,880
living in mindfully having intentions of harmlessness

98
00:28:52,880 --> 00:29:00,720
and appropriate kinds of letting go as a way of being in the world

99
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:13,840
we may find then that by knowing just internally knowing that we have a path

100
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:21,320
we can relax a bit as we go through our life in the world

101
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:29,279
we don't always know what to do or how to deal with certain things but we have

102
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,799
a path it'll be good to approach with

103
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:40,840
mindfulness and wholesomeness and that's enough

104
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,399
and even that small amount of ease that we have from knowing internally that we have a path

105
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:58,360
can support others they can feel our own ease and that helps them too

106
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,279
so may it be that we walk through the world clearly knowing

107
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:15,240
that mindfulness and wholesomeness are beneficial for all

108
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:31,289
[Music]

109
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:43,699
[Music]

110
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:54,919
[Music]

111
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:12,799
so this week we are using animal simileies to discuss the journey

112
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:22,880
that the mind takes from not being wise to being wiser or even free

113
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:30,480
and there's a dharma instruction in each of these cases that comes forth as we use

114
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,520
each of these animals so with the quail it was about getting to safety you know

115
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,640
if you stray into mindlessness come back to the body or the feeling

116
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,799
tone or the mood of the mind or some aspect of the dharma you know just

117
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,919
coming back to the present and then with the monkey yesterday there

118
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:59,440
was a little bit more so monkeys also stray out of mindfulness but then we were also asked to notice

119
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,760
the various patterns that are taking the mind into distraction so monkey mind as

120
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,279
it's called is to be investigated to understand how it is that we get caught

121
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:18,399
up so that's the beginning of insight practice and then once the mind is protected by

122
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:26,159
mindfulness and has a sense of how to investigate its own activity we could say that we're engaged in what

123
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,799
this tradition calls crossing the flood it means that we're learning to navigate

124
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,559
this mind and body while living our life here with other people in the flood is

125
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:44,640
kind of a word for distractions like greed hatred and delusion and other

126
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,320
challenges that come into the mind wanting to have certain identities

127
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,000
wanting to grasp on to things those are all the floods that can overwhelm us but

128
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,760
once we have the tools we can begin to cross over that uh toward having some

129
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,360
freedom from these forces in our mind and sometimes freedom is called the

130
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,720
other shore you know as if we're we're going to that place

131
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:20,080
although it's not really a place it's right here but today for our animal we are moving

132
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,120
on to the cow now there are a lot of cows in the sutas

133
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:32,559
it was an agricultural society at the time of the Buddha so everybody knew about cows if you said cow everybody had

134
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,080
a an image of what that was it may be less obvious for us but I think I think

135
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,679
you'll get the point um there so there's a wide range of cow analogies but the

136
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:52,159
majority are in the realm that we're going to talk about today so cows are herd animals and they tend

137
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,559
to follow a leader and this is actually an important aspect of our path

138
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:05,679
there's a suta about cows crossing a river under the guidance of a cow herd

139
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:11,280
and in the suta the Buddha first talks about the cow herd so in in one case

140
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,960
there's an unwise cow herd who doesn't look carefully to understand the

141
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,118
nearshore and the far shore and then she drives her cows across the Ganges River

142
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,480
where there isn't a ford so there's kind of no understanding of what's going on

143
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:35,440
and this doesn't turn out very well for the cows but then there's a wise cow herd who

144
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,520
understands both the nearshore and the far shore and drives her cows across the

145
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:49,440
river at a place that has a ford and so she's also further wise about which cows

146
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,720
can swim better than others and she chooses to send them across in a wise

147
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,839
order so uh first the cow herd drives across the

148
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:05,040
the bulls um the kind of strong leaders of the of

149
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,880
the herd and it says in the suta they breasted the stream of the Ganges and

150
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,079
safely reached the far shore so you imagine these bulls having no trouble

151
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,440
crossing a river and then after that she drives across the what are called the

152
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,760
strong intractable cows and they too breast the stream of the Ganges and

153
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,160
safely reach the far shore and then she drives across the bulocks and the heers

154
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:40,320
the younger cows and they all breast the stream and reach the far shore and then

155
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,079
finally the calves and the weak cattle the ones maybe who are sick or otherwise

156
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:52,400
weakened and they too can get across and get safely to the far shore and then it

157
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,680
adds this little line that said "Once it happened that a baby calf had just been

158
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:04,480
born urged on by its mother's loing even it managed to breast the stream of the

159
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:12,640
Ganges and safely reach the far shore." So it's a nice image of these cows and

160
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,400
then there's a you know an analogy created so the bulls are likened to

161
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:25,680
arahants to people who are fully awakened and then the other groups of cows are likened to people who are not

162
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:31,280
fully awakened but do have various degrees of wisdom so this is a smart way

163
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,040
to do it right so that when the smaller or the weaker or younger cows see the

164
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:45,119
other ones before them getting across the river and reaching the far shore safely they feel confident in entering

165
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:52,640
the river also so some cows are not very strong swimmers but even they can get across

166
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,040
even the tiny calf is inspired when cheered on by the loing of its mother

167
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:05,599
so I like to say that what we see here is the value of having a teacher on our

168
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:11,359
path and having real guidance you know having good meditation instructions and

169
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:17,440
also having some kind of a group that we're working with like a SA we do need

170
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,280
this in some way along our path you know that might be being with a literal

171
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,720
in-person group but not everybody has that it can also be an online group like

172
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:37,119
this one for example or it could be taking guidance from a teacher in some other way but somehow getting um clear

173
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,640
instructions and a sense that we're uh doing this in line with the tradition

174
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,040
and in line with other people it helps a lot and then the Buddha is likened to

175
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:56,960
the cow herd so he claims to fully understand the human condition that's the nearshore and the farshore and also

176
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,079
to know that there is a ford so he knows that the teachings he's offering really

177
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,440
will work and that we you know we can get across the river of difficulties in

178
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:14,640
our life and in our mind if we do mindfulness practice and follow the various kinds of instructions that are

179
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:22,079
found in the Buddhist teachings there are also lots of sudas that use this image of crossing the flood uh to

180
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:30,640
talk about the journey to freedom so it isn't just this one with the cows and we can even do all of this now in

181
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,839
this modern world where we don't have a living Buddha notice that the cows were

182
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:41,760
following the stronger cows uh it's good enough to watch older dharma students

183
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,119
and to listen to a modern-day dharma teacher by whom you feel inspired like

184
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,920
the calf listening to its mother for example i remember uh when I went on my first

185
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:01,200
residential retreat it was it was a nine night retreat and I had only done a

186
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:08,320
dayong before that that was the longest I had ever meditated and I was going on this nine- night retreat and it was very

187
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:15,119
helpful for me when I was there to see the more experienced practitioners

188
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,640
what were they doing sitting walking sitting walking following the schedule

189
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,720
sitting still in the hall and so I just did that too i figured that was what you

190
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,560
did on retreat and it worked great and I fell in love with retreats right away

191
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,839
so yeah I was listening to the dharma talks and instructions also of course but the teachers aren't in the hall all

192
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:43,760
the time so it was really important that I could watch people who had been on

193
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,960
more retreats than me so maybe it's worth some time of

194
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,680
reflection what is your inspiration what keeps you going are there ways in which

195
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:03,359
you have observed others and gained confidence on the path in some way

196
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,079
and it's also worth pointing out that this is not a static process if that

197
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,440
makes sense um if we want to get all the way across the

198
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,359
river and not say stop in the middle we're going to need to move forward in

199
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:27,920
some appropriate way so for example if you started meditation

200
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,160
by listening to guided meditations that is great and it's great for a while it

201
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:41,920
may keep you on the cushion it keeps your mind coming back to have prompts coming uh through your ears but at some

202
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,440
point it's also important to learn how to guide yourself in meditation and not

203
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,720
have to listen to a guided meditation or if you like listening to dharma talks

204
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,880
that's great i listen to dharma talks from time to time but also you may want

205
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:06,319
to try some study to directly learn the teachings um this has effects at levels

206
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:11,359
that we can't even see to study the sutas or to learn the structure of the

207
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:18,319
of the dharma if you have a regular sitting practice where you find you know a time to sit

208
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:24,319
every day that's really great that's not easy for everyone to do but then how

209
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:29,359
about trying a dayong you know set aside a whole day where all you do is sit and

210
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,560
walk and listen to the dharma and probably eventually uh most of us

211
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,319
will benefit from some kind of extended retreat time if we're able to manage

212
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:48,400
that get the conditions in our life that can take longer to arrange but you know keep keep going keep going

213
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,240
across the river keep looking to those who are farther along and at the same

214
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,000
time keep listening to that within you that wants to cross the flood

215
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,040
sometimes and maybe eventually more and more of the time the guidance that we

216
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:12,000
take the cow herd and even the other cows seem to come from inside as well as

217
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,200
outside this is again a a way of talking

218
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:24,480
about our ongoing insight journey so in the cow I see an element of

219
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:31,920
humility we do need help crossing um that's not about self-deprecation or

220
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:39,040
making ourselves small that's different from from real humility in a sense

221
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,480
it's just the reality that we won't go as far on our path if we try to walk

222
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,599
completely alone so I have a certain fondness for the the

223
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,040
humble cow and um maybe we could say that the cow

224
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:00,480
is about sa and trust in just continuing

225
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,720
the work of going step by step across the river and we can do it we can cross

226
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:14,000
this blood so continuing on we'll have another animal

227
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,480
tomorrow and thank you very much be well
