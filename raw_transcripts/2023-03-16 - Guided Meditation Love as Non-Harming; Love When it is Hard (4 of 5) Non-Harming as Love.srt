1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:12,179
so hello everyone Welcome to our meditation session

2
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:19,940
and the

3
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:32,398
one of the very important principles in Buddhist

4
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,440
practice in Buddhism one of the

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,899
principles that when we live by it or when we observe it in the world

6
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:50,460
can be a source of tremendous inspiration and and happiness

7
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,640
one of the it's a profound principle for human life it's a profound aspect of

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:05,160
Love itself and that is the dedication to non-harming

9
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,340
and non-harming is maybe not often associated with love

10
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:18,200
because sometimes love is expected to be much more active

11
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:24,600
actively having a positive regard actively having feelings of Good Will

12
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,939
and compassion and and appreciation and all kinds of things

13
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:37,560
that come with with love but in fact a profound way of loving

14
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,979
others and loving oneself is to really

15
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:50,159
see the value of non-harming because in non-harming

16
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,460
let's just keep it for meditation for now if we are dedicated to not harming with

17
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,700
our thoughts not harming with our actions with our attitudes and our speech

18
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:10,380
that it's uh though the harm is not

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:16,860
interfering with our natural capacity

20
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:24,180
to mature to grow to evolve spiritually dharmically humanly

21
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,060
human beings are built to change

22
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,459
over time and certainly if you get older we recognize the house change

23
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:40,560
but part of the change that's built into US is that of maturation

24
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,660
a growth and wisdom a growth and freedom a growth in love

25
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,720
and this phenomenal growth that's possible has a is a natural thing

26
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,819
that has uh one of the most important qualities is to get out of the way for

27
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:03,780
it to not interfere with it in a life dedicated to non-harming

28
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,540
is a life dedicated to not putting up the obstacles to this

29
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,980
natural growth natural Evolution that's possible within us

30
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:24,420
so a heightened sensitivity to how our thoughts undermine us harm us

31
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,260
by negative thinking critical thinking um

32
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:39,599
and sometimes those thoughts come with authority like this is true

33
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,799
but no thought that undermines us no thought which

34
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,420
doesn't look upon us with kindness basic kindness

35
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:57,239
no thought that um somehow hurts

36
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:05,060
in some deep way it's possible to recognize that we have

37
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,000
behavior and thoughts and feelings which are not so healthy

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,079
but that doesn't have to give birth to hurtful harmful thoughts

39
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,080
seeing seeing our shortcomings clearly

40
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,560
without adding harm moves us towards health

41
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,580
so

42
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:47,759
so to not harm and then make space for the practice to

43
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:55,340
evolve so assuming a meditation posture

44
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,000
that maybe allows you to have some nice

45
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,840
balance between being alert and being calm

46
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:19,800
and the alertness is partly to be alert

47
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:26,000
to the thoughts the attitudes the impulses

48
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:37,740
which undermine us deplete us shut us down or tighten us up

49
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,900
that bring tension and reactivity

50
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:49,698
and the calm is partly to so we can better appreciate the alternative

51
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,380
the calmer the mind the hearts are

52
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,520
the less it wants to harm

53
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:12,320
so to take a few long slow deep breaths

54
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,960
and to relax the body

55
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,720
to take some long slow deep breaths

56
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,960
and relax deep inside

57
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,720
and then letting the breathing return to normal

58
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,060
and as you exhale see if you can have a wave a calming

59
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,680
wave through your body

60
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:48,199
exhale and settle in the body calm in the body

61
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:28,620
on the exhale allow there be a calming of the Mind

62
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,960
a quieting of the thinking mind

63
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,940
and then to settle down into the breathing

64
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:21,240
and one way to approach a thorough going

65
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,820
attitude not not harming

66
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:34,339
to assume that in meditation you can do no wrong

67
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,040
nothing is wrong with you

68
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:51,180
however the practice is to keep waking up

69
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,880
to keep being mindful of what is

70
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,180
to clearly see and know what's happening

71
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:10,160
where that clarity of being awake being mindful

72
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:18,980
is leaving everything alone not being involved not picking up

73
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:27,420
not staying staying involved with thoughts

74
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,800
getting out of the way

75
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,680
it's enough just to be clearly aware

76
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,980
of what's Happening Here and Now

77
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:57,680
using breathing as the stabilizing force in the present moment

78
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:02,480
the calming focusing Force

79
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,880
supporting us and not being entangled or involved with

80
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:18,120
anything that goes on just to see just to know

81
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,800
just to feel how it is

82
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:29,220
dedicated to non-harming

83
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,799
is there any way that your thoughts or your attitudes right now

84
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:20,100
are harmful undermining

85
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,960
don't think that that's wrong or a mistake

86
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:45,799
or criticize yourself for it that's more harm

87
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,860
rather know it clearly

88
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,780
recognize it for what it is

89
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,820
and let it be

90
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:14,360
don't granted more attention don't feed it with more involvement

91
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,559
foreign

92
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:25,400
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

93
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:34,500
to live a life of non-harming is to live with a certain kind of

94
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:41,600
reassurance certain kind of inner safety

95
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:51,779
and a heightened capacity to gaze upon everyone

96
00:27:51,779 --> 00:28:00,179
with an open heart with kindness and good will

97
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:08,600
knowing that we're dedicated to not harming them

98
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,658
there's nothing that in our hearts that is closed or

99
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,340
regretful or dangerous for others

100
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:32,460
and even the intention to live without harm

101
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:39,620
is a beautiful intention it's the beginning of a new Direction

102
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:48,240
may it be that on this day as we come out of meditation

103
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,220
that we have a heightened interest

104
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,740
intention to not cause harm

105
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:08,400
and at that dedication is an expression of good will

106
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,600
of kindness of love

107
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,059
may all beings be happy

108
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:29,240
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

109
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,399
and may all beings be free

110
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,268
[Music]

111
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:02,000
[Music] thank you

112
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:11,539
so hello and welcome to the fourth talk on

113
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:21,299
love when it's hard to love in times of challenges

114
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:27,899
and today I'll introduce this topic of non-harming which is one of the I think

115
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:34,980
one of the most marvelous inspiring at least for me qualities a human being can have and is

116
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,200
Central to the whole Buddhist Enterprise and to really appreciate it that's a

117
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:46,080
kind of a unifying principle or core principle of the Dharma puts everything

118
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,320
else into a kind of a into a very important context a very

119
00:31:52,320 --> 00:32:01,200
important kind of fits everything else together and one of the kind of understandings of

120
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:08,240
what a religion is is its religion provides values principles orientations

121
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:15,299
for how to live one's whole life kind of ultimate teachings ultimate purposes

122
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:20,520
ultimate understandings that apply to all over one's life

123
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:29,100
and so this is one of those that makes Buddhism a religion that it's a religion of non-harming

124
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,539
um and not to harm

125
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:40,020
and uh and the core uh one of the core

126
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:47,880
teachings of the Four Noble Truths is an expression of that it's a formulation of that where the word for harm is

127
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:54,899
presented as by the word dukka or suffering and um

128
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:59,658
so I've met people who

129
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:05,820
they're very being they're very disposition and personality way of being in the world

130
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:11,880
was clear that they were a harmless person that they were dedicated to not

131
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,980
harming sometimes such people are dedicated to being honest

132
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:23,159
and I've met people who are it seems like they're incapable of lying

133
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:29,880
and um and incapable of harming others and uh

134
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:36,899
this dedication to not harm not harm when I was about 20 or 21

135
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:44,100
. um I made a mistake and someone wanted to challenge me to a fist fight

136
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:52,140
and they've all happened very very uh suddenly and um and so there was no premeditated

137
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:58,500
thought on my part but what I immediately did was I dropped

138
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:06,000
to one knee and spread out my my hands wide and as if you know I'm now I'm

139
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,060
vulnerable and I'm not defending myself and and I said I can't fight

140
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:19,200
and um the um and uh so rather than than being you

141
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,560
know defensively being beaten up on the person uh spun around and marched off

142
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:32,398
and discussed but this idea of not being able to fight not being able to

143
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,040
um harm anyone whether that should be practiced all the

144
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:45,179
time in the way that I just described for myself that's a personal question and I I'm not for me to say in all the

145
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:51,300
circumstances of Life what we would do but to have as a in the Forefront of our

146
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:57,180
hearts and Minds this care to not want

147
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:04,560
to harm um and to really make that the first consideration the first kind of cons way

148
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,440
of thinking about a situation you're like that's not harm here

149
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:17,760
and um and I'm teaching about this for this week about love because it's a form of

150
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,240
love to not harm and rather than always expect love to

151
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:32,099
have a very high bar what love is that it means having um you know just filled with warmth and

152
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:38,460
appreciation and joy and kind of a Radiance of positive regard for anyone

153
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:46,099
and everyone and everywhere that love can also not be so

154
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:51,900
dramatic it doesn't have to be that we always have a warm heart an open heart a

155
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:57,619
generous kind of sense of kind of gushing um

156
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:04,920
joy and appreciation and compassion for others sometimes love is quieter it's more

157
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,099
basic and one of the forms of Love is um

158
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:16,680
is not harming we love others through not harming them

159
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,260
we love others by not setting up obstacles for their growth and their evolution and their development of their

160
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:28,440
life we love others by giving them room to be who they are

161
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,740
we give love to others by

162
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:39,960
giving them safety so many people in this world are not safe don't feel safe

163
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:46,140
grow go have grown up not feeling safe and and don't automatically feel that

164
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:52,079
other people they encounter are safe for them but to really kind of get a sense that

165
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,440
someone is harmless dedicated to being harmless that they're not going to harm is a gift

166
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,839
that we give to other people and it's a gift of love of care love

167
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:09,140
being a respect for others maybe we don't have gushing warmth for someone

168
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:14,940
but we have an appreciation for their autonomy their possibility their

169
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:20,599
Humanity that we don't want to mess with it

170
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:27,599
a dedication to non-harming is also indirected towards oneself

171
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:34,859
that one doesn't want to harm oneself in any way and this is also a form of love

172
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:41,099
and again same thing as before that we measure sometimes the idea of Love or

173
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:48,119
meta towards oneself compassion for oneself it was some idea that it's maybe more

174
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:53,280
than it has to be it has to be some a little bit you know you know warmth and

175
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:00,420
gushing and delight and and kind of lots of smiles and

176
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:06,119
but sometimes you know even towards ourselves it's profound it's a profound

177
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,880
form of love that's quieter that's not a big gushing kind of feeling of warmth

178
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:20,599
but rather just simply caring enough for oneself that one doesn't want to cause harm to oneself

179
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,040
as we practice mindfulness a very important thing begins happening that

180
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,560
Mythos brings a heightened sensitivity to the impact of our Behavior the impact

181
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:38,940
of our thoughts our attitudes our impulses we have our and what we start discovering is that

182
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:45,480
when we intentionally want to harm someone else get revenge or you know somehow

183
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:51,780
cynically poke them in some way or whatever it might be

184
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:57,300
we are simultaneously harming ourselves in fact for the in the teachings of the

185
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:03,300
Buddha uh he actually says that when we intentionally harm others

186
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:08,880
we actually harm ourselves much much more than we harm the other

187
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,099
and uh and kind of mythically they talk about you know rebirth that even if you

188
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:21,720
do something like kill someone else that's pretty bad for that person who died and that only diminished the horror

189
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,720
of that but for the person who kills they're going to get Reborn

190
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:33,300
endless times many many many times where they're going to be killed violently and

191
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:40,260
be tortured and in these kind of burning Hills so those that's kind of Mythic teachings

192
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:46,920
of Buddha Buddhism but it kind of points this idea how much we harm ourselves more

193
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:55,320
than we harm others if we want to intentionally harm them and so we can feel that when we have the

194
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:01,920
heightened deep and sensitivity of mindfulness and um and it's a game changer to feel

195
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,579
that and see that how much we harm ourselves and um

196
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:15,359
and so that we also then see how we harm ourselves um by our negative attitudes towards

197
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:21,599
ourselves and uh and to not want to harm ourselves

198
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,940
anymore even if the negative attitudes have some truth to them

199
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:32,640
they're not needed we don't need to send arrows into our own hearts

200
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,820
we don't need to set up obstacles that interfere with the natural growth into

201
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:45,839
goodness into honesty into non-harming that exists in every heart

202
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:52,380
in your heart and our hearts and so not to add restrictions on

203
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:57,540
ourselves not to add things that undermine us or or discourage us or

204
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:02,940
depress us you know one of the leading causes for depression they say is negative

205
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:08,579
self-talk and the negative self-talk can come with such Authority it can seem like it's

206
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:13,800
true when it has to happen but you know in that it's it's

207
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:20,940
repetitive over and over and over again it's not useful so to recognize it as a kind of

208
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:26,640
self-harm might begin to make put a crack into

209
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,820
this strong impulse we have to have negative self-talk

210
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:39,240
to realize it's not necessary there's another way

211
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:46,260
there's a way of not harming and it's not easy to make a shift

212
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:51,780
but it isn't so much that we have to actively do something else like love

213
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:59,579
other people it's mostly an avoidance and even if all it takes is to bite your

214
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:04,680
tongue to avoid saying the harmful thing this is beneficial

215
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:12,660
sometimes we have to really restrain ourselves physically so that we don't punch someone out

216
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:18,720
and um the um I had the occasion to do that to

217
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,940
avoid punching someone out in a meditation Hall once when I was in Asia

218
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:30,660
where we were all monks practicing together and but this monk who was sitting next to me must have hated me

219
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:37,880
and I kind of prejudice and and was constantly poking me and and

220
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,900
saying kind of not nice things to me and during meditation that in Buddhist

221
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:48,780
monastery and so I just sat there and and you know

222
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,940
I never replied in meditation but there was one day I remember I just was felt

223
00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:00,839
like I just want to turn around and punch the guy in the face and um but I I didn't

224
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:07,079
and uh I kept my hands to myself and that took a fair amount of restraints

225
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:14,579
so sometimes it works that way that we have to just restrain and that's the beginning of an alternative

226
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:21,119
and but also to begin to learn how not to participate with the thoughts and

227
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,520
impulses without having to do a lot of work do not pick it up

228
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:31,619
do not give in to it maybe even not believe in it

229
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:37,440
all these efforts all this approach to trying to live with unharming

230
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:44,099
is a significant way of loving so the question where is the love how

231
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:51,119
can I love in this when there's a challenging situation here's an you know an easy answer but

232
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:57,119
not always easy to implement that love is found in the dedication to

233
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:03,660
non-harming and and I'd like to propose

234
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:10,619
is that this is such an important and Central value that it's more important to adhere to

235
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:16,740
that than somehow solve the challenges we're in

236
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:21,839
and it'll end with a story that Dalai Lama tells

237
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:27,180
of some point in India he met with a monk

238
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:33,420
who had been in the Chinese prison camp for 20 25 years before being released

239
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:41,520
and then he was able to come to India and so the Buddha met with him and the Buddha the Dalai Lama then asked the

240
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,940
monk were you ever in danger in the prison camp you know a violence of starving or

241
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:53,640
something and the monks answer surprised Dalai Lama

242
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,940
and the monk said yes I was in danger I was in danger of losing my compassion

243
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,200
for the prison guards

244
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:13,859
the greatest well the greatest Health the greatest thing that the monk had maybe was his compassion His Kind regard

245
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:19,560
his not wanting to harm anyone and that was that's what he identified

246
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:28,020
as being the most precious most important part of who he is and um and so more than anything else

247
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:33,420
perhaps non-harming represents our greatest

248
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:39,599
wealth our greatest Beauty our greatest home our greatest

249
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:45,720
kind of one most wonderful place that life can radiate from

250
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,839
and no matter what the challenge that we're in

251
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:57,559
for a Buddhist the love that doesn't want to harm

252
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:04,880
should always be close by him may we love the world

253
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:10,920
through a dedication to non-harming so thank you

254
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:17,420
very much and priority being back here tomorrow
