right I take me well let's

4
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:23,200

5
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,000
me how how is

6
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,959

e

44
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:14,079
good evening and welcome welcome everybody nice to see you

45
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:23,839
all so today I'd like to talk a a little bit more about kind of a topic that I

46
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:29,680
introduced last week it's perfectly fine if you didn't hear last

47
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:36,160
week but it's not unusual that when we're meditating especially for a longer

48
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:42,200
sit you know 45 minutes we might notice there's this thought there's this

49
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:48,160
like uh narration this uh inner dialogue or inner I don't know conversation maybe

50
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:55,280
that's happening something like uh I can't meditate or well I've been practicing

51
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,359
for so long and still you know here it is after 45 minutes when is this dang

52
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:06,460
Bell going to ring anyways right is she

53
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:12,319
[Laughter] awake so at the same time like I can't

54
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:17,599
meditate or what's my mind is out of control or maybe at the same time or not

55
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:22,960
the exact same time but within the same minute there might be somebody like well

56
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:29,880
I'm sitting up straighter than that other person or I'm quieter than that other person or whatever it might be

57
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:36,319
right there's these ways in which we have these thoughts where we're comparing ourselves to

58
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:41,520
others sometimes we think that we're better sometimes we think that we're worse and sometimes we think that we're

59
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:49,280
the same you know however it is it's uh pretty common to compare

60
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:57,960
ourselves and it's also pretty common that in these comparisons we come up uh

61
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:04,280
feeling not so good there's a way in which we're kind of like beating ourselves up there's this inner critic

62
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:10,720
that gets activated and it can be pretty persuasive be seem to be pretty

63
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:16,079
authoritative and pretty loud this inner critic we I've talked

64
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:24,280
about this a number of times a number of different settings but uh I think it's an important thing to just talk about

65
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:30,400
because it has such a big influence on us whether we recognize it or not and

66
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,040
we'll talk about that a little bit more later but first I'll just spend a

67
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:42,280
little bit moment describing this inner critic it's this way that this maybe

68
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:49,400
this inner voice that's constantly putting us down belittling us it's has this self

69
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:56,040
judgment as negativity like you can't do this or

70
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:03,160
gosh this is you won't be able just you won't be able to do it or it's so it's

71
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:10,280
just awful some of the things that we say to ourselves you're a loser or you know whatever it might be we would never

72
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:16,880
say to anybody else but sometimes we say to ourselves blaming ourselves for any

73
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:23,119
experience of discomfort or noticing how the mind is seemingly out of control and

74
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:28,960
can't quite get it to settle down there's this way that this inner critic

75
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:36,839
kind like is nagging at us wanting us to behave differently and be better somehow

76
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:41,960
not maybe it's not even clear exactly what this better is and there's

77
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:47,960
fascinating for me it's a little bit fascinating how it also comes with this sense of

78
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:55,839
Shame somehow like this feeling of inadequacy is like we shouldn't be this

79
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:01,000
way there's something like inherently wrong with

80
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:08,520
us of course none of these things are true but we believe them we believe so

81
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:16,799
many of our thoughts of course we do we're having these thoughts I'm having it it must be true and so much about practice is

82
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:22,359
seeing how we don't have to believe our thoughts and I'll talk a little bit more

83
00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:27,520
about that today but I also just want to point out also one more other thing

84
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:33,760
about this inner critic is this um has an a tone of

85
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:40,240
harshness it's not a kind warm loving thing it has this this uh this

86
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:48,040
environment or this climate that gets created of harshness as opposed to like warmth and

87
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:54,640
kindness so this feeling of inadequacy of not being enough or somehow The Who I

88
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:03,640
Am or how I am is not enough it's of often based on

89
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:08,799
comparing and whether that comparing is explicit or implicit there's a way in

90
00:54:08,799 --> 00:54:16,280
which we're comparing to this idea we have about how we should

91
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,400
be this idea about how other people

92
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:27,240
are or maybe it's an idea of how have been in the

93
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:34,480
past so is there's this comparison like it should be maybe we have this glorified ideal out there

94
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:40,880
somewhere and then we have our experience and noticing the Gap and something wrong with me terribly wrong

95
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:48,280
with me or this sense of because I'm not worthy because I'm not uh meeting

96
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:55,680
whatever I'm getting compared to whatever I compare myself to well something that I want want to

97
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:01,640
introduce is this whole activity of

98
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:09,400
comparing I'm talking about how we compare and we find ourselves falling up short but also this activity of

99
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:16,400
comparing to others or to how we used to be whether we think that we're better or whether we think that we're

100
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:23,960
the same but it's just the activity of comparing is one way in which we are

101
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:32,599
creating a sense of of me sense of I am like

102
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:38,240
this and this is subtle but it's also

103
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,400
pervasive and so we may be so accustomed to it that we don't even notice it but

104
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:51,240
this sense of I'm like this and there's this reification or this solidity or this

105
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:58,280
sense of I'm like this and I'm always like this there's something about my

106
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:07,559
inherent meanness we have this idea like just to be me means to have this quality I'm I a

107
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:16,200
terrible meditator I'll never be able to meditate correctly or somehow for me I had certainly this

108
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:23,520
idea that whatever I was doing wasn't enough like I had to do more like I had

109
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:28,799
to work harder or get more education or

110
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:34,480
work longer hours or move up the corporate ladder back when I was in Corporate America you know there I had

111
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:40,760
this feel like it always had to be more it's exhausting have you

112
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:48,520
noticed some of you might have noticed this right but not only does this way of kind

113
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:55,079
of uh comparing for me I kind of had this idea that it just wasn't enough somehow

114
00:56:55,079 --> 00:57:01,400
doesn't matter what I compared myself to and at that time I'm not even sure I would have been able to articulate this

115
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:08,280
to you it's something that now looking back I can see so clearly from this vantage point but from that when I was

116
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:14,440
in the midst of it it was just natural and of course I mean that's because all

117
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:21,760
my peers right had this feeling too this is how often organizations work they

118
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:29,119
have this sense of you have to do more but the sense of me also is this when we

119
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:36,520
compare is this solidification like I'm like this but also what comes with that

120
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:43,240
is a sense of I'm like this and you are like that we are

121
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:50,119
separate there's and this distinction between us is very clear these these aren't like

122
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:57,000
necessarily um explicit thoughts that we have but inherent in the sense of me is

123
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:04,319
a sense of separateness and of course we are separate right I'm here in this uh body

124
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:11,000
and with this Skin Barrier and you guys are over there each of you in your own so I'm not saying anything that's you

125
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,079
know metaphysical or I'm just saying that the sense of being

126
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:22,880
separate sense of being isolated sometimes this gets

127
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:30,920
highlighted and sometimes it's not even there it's really fluid and if we think

128
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:41,160
about it with our thinking mind of course we're of course separate I don't know what Diana is talking about but what I'm pointing to is

129
00:58:41,319 --> 00:58:48,079
experience not thoughts experience so for

130
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:53,720
example when we're doing one of our favorite activities

131
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:58,559
gardening Sports

132
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,079
hiking doing jigs up puzzles drinking tea with our friends

133
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:11,119
coffee whatever it might be there isn't this inherent sense of or really strong

134
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:19,039
sense of being separate we're just doing what we're doing we're just hiking we're just in

135
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:24,920
nature we're just drinking coffee as opposed to these other are

136
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:30,079
times when we have a real sense of I'm inadequate I'm not enough or something

137
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:35,640
like this inherent with this is a sense of

138
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:43,480
separation and this and probably you've noticed there's a sense of Dua with this

139
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:52,480
right and Dua representing this word has such a really wide range from this really subtle very subtle very subtle

140
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,839
sense of H something's not quite right

141
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:03,119
to just these horrifying terrifying experiences on the other end of the

142
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:08,400
spectrum and hopefully you're not experiencing over here on this end of

143
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:14,680
spectrum where things are just the absolute worst but there's often this sense of like dissatisfaction like

144
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:21,039
things aren't quite right need to be better want to be a little bit more

145
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:27,200
comfortable so the Buddha pointed to this sense of this comparing and the

146
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:33,319
sense of me that gets created with comparing making a me and comparing are

147
01:00:33,319 --> 01:00:40,440
exactly the same thing kind of looked at from different aspects and there's this way that this

148
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:46,880
making a me we could also say is making a self a self is this thing that uh has

149
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:54,240
this inherent existence that is separate from everything else again I'm not saying that you don't

150
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:02,039
exist that would be silly to say something like that I'm pointing to this

151
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:09,520
what I was pointing to maybe earlier is like this sense of separateness and this real distinct sense of uh I'm

152
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:15,960
me and Buddhist practice is not anything about like destroying the self or

153
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:22,680
exploding the self or dissolving the self or erasing the self or emerging the

154
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:28,799
self with some big uh Unity of with something else that's not

155
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:35,400
what's being pointed to at all instead what's being pointed to is a

156
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:41,240
type of understanding about the self that brings

157
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:49,720
Freedom a type of understanding that brings ease a type of understanding that brings

158
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:56,520
peace and sense of well-being that's what's being pointed to with all these

159
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:02,400
teachings and so when we start to understand like deeply like in our

160
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:10,200
hearts and minds and maybe even in a way in our bodies then we realize that well

161
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:16,079
actually there isn't anything here here that I have to

162
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:23,079
protect I have to defend that I have to worry about and there's this way that uh when

163
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:29,279
we recognize that fear just gets released because we don't

164
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:35,319
have to protect and defend so what there isn't the fear there and there's this

165
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:40,079
Freedom that arises this beautiful

166
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:46,039
Freedom so we might say if we've listened to this talk so far like okay

167
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:53,000
comparing is making a self or a me and this is about understanding a self so we

168
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:59,960
can find more freedom Buddhist practice ice we would say is about that then we might say okay then I just need to stop

169
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:07,079
comparing we can't this is what humans do this is part of you know The Human

170
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:13,960
Experience only the most realized people don't compare so instead we do like what we do

171
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:19,160
with everything in our practice that seems like an obstacle or a

172
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:25,799
difficulty we use it as a Gateway we use it as a a stepping stone

173
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:30,920
for a greater understanding it's a Gateway for some different type of

174
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:36,960
practice so instead of getting having this idea like oh I shouldn't be comparing I shouldn't be

175
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:42,799
judging this is what humans do of course we do right part of it is like this

176
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:49,520
discernment is this helpful not helpful is this person going to help me or harm

177
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:56,079
me you know this is just how we're wired they amount of judging that we do right

178
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:02,799
some of the judging we do is extra so we can make a distinction between judging and discernment but

179
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:09,680
there is a way in which we are always kind of like comparing so how do we use this when we

180
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:17,559
notice that this is happening how can we use this as a way to deepen our practice to find a way to Greater ease and Peace

181
01:04:17,559 --> 01:04:25,960
and Freedom so one way is to just when we

182
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:33,839
notice that this comparing is happening I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment but when we notice that this

183
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:38,880
is happening and part of it could be because this inner critic is really loud

184
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:46,400
I'm lousy I'm a terrible meditator I don't even know why I come to these meditation centers or I mean obviously

185
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:52,279
it could be the other I'm the best one here I don't even know why Diana is there teaching I should be the one

186
01:04:52,279 --> 01:04:58,480
that's teaching or you know sometimes we have these ideas like what does she know what does the teacher

187
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:04,240
know we all have these types of ideas right I could do a better job something

188
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:10,480
like this so here's one thing how we can make this as a gateway to Greater

189
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:16,680
Freedom when we discover that we're doing this comparing is we can ask

190
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:25,720
ourselves how does this comparing impact how I see myself and others

191
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:31,880
how does this comparing impact how I see myself and

192
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:39,160
others the act of comparing maybe You' noticed that you're already seeing yourself in a dim light but how does

193
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:44,559
this act of comparing also influence how you see

194
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:52,119
others so whether or not you answer that question just asking that question can

195
01:05:52,119 --> 01:06:01,000
be enormously helpful how is this impacting me a because asking that question means

196
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,559
that you're not completely lost in it you are aware that this comparing is

197
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:12,599
happening and asking the question kind of reinforces this a way of not being

198
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:18,079
completely lost in it recognizing that it's happening so to ask the question

199
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:26,400
reinforces this is something that's happening this comparing but but it

200
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:33,720
also highlights or maybe reminds us that when we feel bad about ourselves when we

201
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:43,920
feel good about ourselves when we're comparing ourselves influences what we

202
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,640
experience and how we interpret what we

203
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:55,720
experience we all have this experience of getting up on the wrong side of the the bed I like to give this example

204
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:02,720
because I think all of us know this the way in which we're cranky we haven't had enough to sleep eat or we haven't had

205
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:10,240
enough sleep or that person is doing that thing that annoys me so much and I'm getting like

206
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:15,279
angry and then we just notice that everything starts to irritate us our

207
01:07:15,279 --> 01:07:20,440
tempers are short and we just notice all the

208
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:25,920
terrible things that are happening

209
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:33,440
in contrast if we have this great sleep we're on vacation we have fantastic

210
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:38,880
meals spending times with our loved ones we're so happy to be where we are maybe

211
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:45,760
it's like aesthetically visually beautiful we at the beach or in the mountains whatever it

212
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:51,240
is have some ease the same person doing that thing

213
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:58,839
that irritates you oh yeah okay there's that person's doing the thing that irritates me but you don't get so angry

214
01:07:58,839 --> 01:08:04,079
about it or we might notice these ways of like

215
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:10,200
we're saying to ourselves oh there you go again

216
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:17,400
you're whatever like I'm trying to think like this long list of things that we say to ourselves for me sometimes I find

217
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:24,560
myself SC Diana and but I say it out loud like what I'm tryed to like focus

218
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:30,080
and I have like some work to get done and I find myself like you know doing something else and like oh yeah yeah

219
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:36,040
yeah you really have to do this I sometimes I find myself saying Diana out

220
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:41,318
loud and that's like it's a little wakeup call yes get to

221
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:48,199
work so when we there's this sense of ease then maybe we just say oh there

222
01:08:48,199 --> 01:08:53,920
okay that's from my case that's just doing what Diana does doesn't have to

223
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:59,238
mean anything that I'm an inherently bad person or inherently uh little bit

224
01:08:59,239 --> 01:09:05,560
unfocused or it doesn't have to mean anything it just means that that's what's happening at that

225
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:12,278
time but there's this way that also asking this question how does this

226
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:20,120
comparing impact how I see myself and others highlights this that the way that

227
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:26,159
we are looking at experience effects

228
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:33,238
experience so we always have lenses through which we are

229
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:41,278
looking we may not even recognize this there may be a way we think well I'm just seeing the way things are of course

230
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:49,440
we are of course I am but how can it be that sometimes the exact same

231
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:54,679
experience and if I wish I could give a good example off the top of my head

232
01:09:54,679 --> 01:10:01,080
or maybe it's you know putting the dishes away in the dish or putting the dishes in the dishwasher that way that's

233
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:06,400
not quite right you should have the plates all going the certain way or something when our people that we share

234
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:12,719
our households with there's times in which it irritates us and there's a time in which that exact same thing doesn't

235
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:19,560
irritate us which is the real way they do

236
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:25,800
it right it's impossible that doesn't exist the only thing that exists is the

237
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:32,679
way that we are perceiving it at that moment but another moment we might

238
01:10:32,679 --> 01:10:39,679
perceive it differently so the lenses through which

239
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:47,280
we are looking influences what we see not only how we feel about it but

240
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:54,080
what we see we might notice oh yeah they other irritating things when we're

241
01:10:54,080 --> 01:11:02,000
irritated or when you're relaxed and happy maybe you've been on a Meditation Retreat and you've had some real ease

242
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:09,400
and have some time to settle in then you go for walking meditation I know I've had this experience a lot going out for

243
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:16,560
walking meditation and just think like wow this plant is so beautiful I never

244
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:21,920
noticed how these leaves are this particular shape and it's bushy and you

245
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:28,040
know things that ordinarily you just walk on path but after on Retreat there's this way they're just beautiful

246
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:37,520
or the color of uh somebody's jacket I remember one time on this Retreat just think like that is that color blue is so

247
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:45,199
beautiful that person is so lucky to have that jacket that's that color right just these things just you know you

248
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:52,800
become more sensitive to so asking this question when we

249
01:11:52,800 --> 01:12:00,560
notice that we're comparing asking this question how does this comparing impact how I see myself and

250
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:07,560
others does a few things one it helps kind of create a little space between us

251
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:14,360
and the comparing so we're not lost in the comparing two it reminds us that the way

252
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:22,159
that we see things influences how we see things but three it might

253
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:30,120
also bring some insight that there's always a way in which we are viewing

254
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:36,920
things and that way changes so that means that the way

255
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:43,440
things are changes of course it

256
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:51,000
does but sometimes we get stuck in this idea that things are a certain way and this is just the way that it

257
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,400
is so we're always looking through one lens or another maybe it's the one of

258
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:04,280
irritation maybe it's the one of peas or maybe it's the one of boredom or whatever it is and that using that

259
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:10,000
lens affects things and if we intentionally switch to a different lens

260
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,159
we will start to notice things differently and this is partly how meditation practice

261
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:21,199
works so that's one way we can use this comparing as a

262
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:28,400
Gateway and another way is that we can notice that I talked about how this

263
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:35,199
is like a human thing that we all do humans compare themselves to

264
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:43,239
others there's a way that we can tune into yes this is very often painful to

265
01:13:43,239 --> 01:13:51,199
be comparing ourselves to others not only because sometimes we don't show up in the best light but even if we do show

266
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:58,120
up in the best light in the comparison we decide that actually we're Superior and better than whomever we're comparing

267
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:04,280
ourselves to then we have to always protect that and make sure that they don't think that

268
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:10,159
we're inferior somehow we have to project this idea that uh or protect or

269
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:15,480
project that we're somehow better yeah yeah yeah I got it I I know how to do this you you don't have to teach me

270
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:20,600
anything actually I know it all that's a little bit of an exaggeration but there are these subtle

271
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:26,119
ways in which we often are think that we're

272
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,840
better so there's this suffering this and might be subtle or it might not be

273
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:39,920
subtle that always with this comparison whe what whatever the outcome

274
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:46,920
is of that comparison even if we think that we're the same there's this way that we always have to evaluate am I still the same did they if they do that

275
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:54,040
do I do that so was this busyness that's associated with it so one way that we can use this

276
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:59,560
comparing as a gateway to Greater freedom is to connect to the common

277
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:05,440
Humanity of this experience oh right this is what it

278
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:12,960
means to be human humans do this and there's a way that we can just

279
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:18,960
say oh yeah just like that person there and that person there and that person there and that person there and that

280
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:26,000
person there and that person there right everybody does it just like

281
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,840
me there's a way that can be kind of connecting we're all trying to find our

282
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:38,040
way with this and sometimes people are deciding that they are superior and they need to

283
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:45,400
somehow for whatever reason need to let us know that they consider themselves Superior we can say okay this is this

284
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:51,960
person doing this comparing it's the human thing we could say like knock yourself out but I'm not going to buy

285
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:58,679
into it I'm not going to buy into this idea that I have to be inferior in order for you to be

286
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:07,070
superior we could just notice this is what humans do we don't have to get angry at them we don't have

287
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:15,320
[Music] to be disappointed in them or make them be different we can just say yes I can

288
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:21,480
see that you are doing this comparing I do it too and it could just

289
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:29,560
end there could just end there without having to agree or disagree with

290
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:38,199
it so these are two ways that actually can be powerful ways to work with this

291
01:16:38,199 --> 01:16:43,480
comparing as a gateway to Greater freedom but what if we find that we

292
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:51,199
can't even do this working as it with a Gateway because we're just completely lost in it and this what this idea of

293
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:56,560
this gateway to Greater ease or stepping stone just feels like just not

294
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:01,600
accessible CU sometimes when we are in the midst of comparing and we are sure

295
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:07,280
that we're Superior or better because this person like certainly we wouldn't do

296
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:13,320
that or we think that we inferior if we don't have access to maybe use this to

297
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:18,400
the practice that's okay this is what happens too it's also as part of the

298
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:25,560
what it means to be a human I want to talk about what are some things that we can do when we

299
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:33,320
notice the first is you have to notice and so part of a mindfulness

300
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:40,440
practice or meditation practice is getting to know like what the Mind does getting to know kind like this

301
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:46,560
inner dialogue getting to know this inner voice and to recognize when this

302
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:52,000
comparing is happening and you just have to just notice

303
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:58,560
it you might just start doing it again but then notice it again and then you might

304
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:06,880
start doing it again and then notice again and this can be your practice maybe your just mindfulness of

305
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:12,600
comparing and we shouldn't underestimate how powerful that alone can

306
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:19,880
be can like oh there's comparing oh okay that's interesting and then maybe we just do

307
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:26,480
what we're going to do next and then oh yep there's comparison that's inter interesting one thing that can be

308
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:31,679
helpful and can be powerful is to count

309
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:38,760
them I can't do this this is ridiculous oh that's comparison that's comparing

310
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:45,520
one see that person is making so much noise then I'm not making oh that's

311
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:50,560
comparison number two and then just count and there's this way of counting

312
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:56,000
it starts to feel it takes away some of the authority and

313
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:04,040
the I don't know negativity what and it can it starts to be kind of fun like wow

314
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:09,960
327 you know really no wait 327 328 you know

315
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:17,400
like or you can't remember but it's a way to kind like shift our relationship to it because often when we notice that

316
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:23,199
we're doing this we have this idea that we shouldn't and then there's this aversion and then the aversion kind of

317
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:28,800
like sticks us to it when we're get tangled up in it so the counting is a way that kind of like

318
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:35,400
normalizes and maybe UND does some of the aversion to it so that's one thing

319
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:41,239
to do first you have to notice and then just start counting how many times it comes up and that can

320
01:19:41,239 --> 01:19:47,360
shift the second is to notice how it feels in the

321
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:53,520
body like really how it feels in the body and this can be really subtle

322
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:59,400
I talked about how there's a real distinct sense of me versus the

323
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:05,920
world so there's a subtle sense of contraction there's a subtle sense of

324
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:13,960
like this sense of a limit that's like me and here's my boundaries and there's the world and everything that's on this

325
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:20,239
side is there a way that you could feel into that feel into either this subtle

326
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:25,600
sense of contraction or feel into this sense of

327
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:31,679
being separate or having a limit or maybe the sense of comparing is if

328
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:37,880
you're noticing there's a lot of like the superiority con seeit maybe there's a sense of this even if I find myself to

329
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:44,199
this in my body like puffing out my chest a little bit maybe you might even notice like the chest gets puffed out or

330
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:49,880
if you're noticing that the outcome of the comparing is that uh of

331
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:55,080
being inferior you know notice that the shoulders and the head might droop a

332
01:20:55,080 --> 01:21:02,600
little bit these might be subtle or they might be obvious but just to feel in the

333
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:08,040
body and to do this with a sense of kindness and curiosity like wow okay how

334
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:15,560
does this show up in the body not so that we can chastise ourselves but just

335
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:21,080
so that we can notice because again kind of like

336
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:28,159
transforming the comp comparing into a sematic

337
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:33,480
experience is a way that we can interrupt this momentum of

338
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:40,239
comparing so tuning into the felt sense to the bodily experience is a way that

339
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:46,679
takes some of the power out of and the and the this Loop that we find ourselves

340
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:55,440
in out of this comparing and then maybe there's a way that we can invite the body to

341
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:06,040
relax what when we notice how this comparing gets felt maybe there's a way that we can invite it to

342
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:11,960
relax and some ways that the way that we would relax is to bring a little bit

343
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:18,960
more spaciousness or openness and that can be literally or

344
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:24,920
figuratively figuratively is maybe we might to be focused in on maybe we feel

345
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:30,840
this contraction this tightness right here in the chest and to bring to

346
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:37,679
relax can be to bring more spaciousness is to literally just maybe open up awareness to the whole

347
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:42,920
body to recognize that you're sitting and this is what it feels like to sit if

348
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:48,040
you're standing that's what it feels like to be standing so open up awareness

349
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:56,000
a little bit to the whole body open up be beyond the

350
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:01,800
body this really kind of like loose spacious awareness it's really big and

351
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:07,760
that is just receiving experiences most notably exp

352
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:14,600
receiving sound or maybe there's like a a a

353
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:22,080
sensation in the knee or the back or something that arises is there a way that the awareness can be really big and

354
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:29,080
relaxed next and then like maybe this uh twinge in the knee might arise a sound over

355
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:34,880
there might arise and we just let these experiences arise and then pass away

356
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:41,320
while we're just keeping awareness really relaxed and open often we do mindfulness where we're like on one

357
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:47,800
thing like the breath in particular feeling the breath perfectly legitimate way to practice but there can be really

358
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:54,480
wise and helpful to practice in a different way to really open up

359
01:23:54,639 --> 01:24:02,639
is there a way that we can use wisdom practices so I talked

360
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:10,159
about mindfulness notice the thoughts mindfulness of the body opening up the awareness but also we can bring in some

361
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:16,040
wisdom practices to help us with this comparing and this also can really help

362
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:22,080
uh with our bring more Peace and Freedom and ease and this is to remember that

363
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:29,960
our experience is always changing we know this if we've every

364
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:35,199
time we've looked at or meditated we've noticed that things are always changing

365
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:40,639
every meditation session is different it might have some similar

366
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:46,960
qualities but the actual session is different and of course actually all of

367
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:53,239
our experiences are changing otherwise we would there we would be I

368
01:24:53,239 --> 01:24:58,520
guess blocks of concrete or something right something that's always changing

369
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:05,360
and so we can remind ourselves of that we can remind that uh things there's

370
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:10,440
this inconstancy things are changing and so

371
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:16,520
we might be comparing and can say well we're not always inadequate we're not

372
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:22,360
always feeling in adequate we're not always the best we're not always best

373
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:29,960
better than others we're not always comparing and so just to bring that in

374
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:36,639
that this uh this flexibility that it's not always like that it kind of like uh

375
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:42,080
drains out some of its Authority like oh yeah this is just what's happening in

376
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:47,440
the mind right now this comparing is just what's happening in the mind right

377
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:52,679
now in a few moments it'll be different might come back to comparing but then

378
01:25:52,679 --> 01:25:58,760
it'll be different and it might come back so there's a way in which we can like grab onto an experience that's

379
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:05,880
happening in the mind think like this is a problem I have to fix it I have to make it go away but if we notice like oh

380
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:12,840
yeah our thoughts are always changing then we can maybe relax a little bit around it and that we'll see that it's

381
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:20,239
changing rising and passing getting more intense less intense going away and then you know we

382
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:27,920
start thinking about yeah what's for dinner you know or whatever you know other types of thoughts that we're

383
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:33,480
having and maybe one last thing that I'll say about uh working with this

384
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:39,920
comparing is remember that comparing are just

385
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:46,480
thoughts they're just thoughts how many thoughts do you have

386
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:53,239
in a day a lot

387
01:26:53,239 --> 01:27:01,560
how stable or solid are thoughts they're not right they're wispy

388
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:07,159
right we can't like grab onto them we can't point to them precise really we

389
01:27:07,159 --> 01:27:12,679
could like just blow them

390
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:18,320
away so these compains they're just thoughts thoughts come and go there are

391
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:24,880
dime a dozen you'll have many of them you might have a thought the sky is

392
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:30,600
blue you might have a thought the carpet is soft you might have a thought there's

393
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:36,400
a blue line right here these are all Just Thoughts like how come some of them are you really

394
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:43,840
holding on to and some of them you're not this is a question to ask yourself

395
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:50,360
this is part of the human Habits Like We grab on to some of them and then we make them mean something without recognizing

396
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:56,280
that actually all thoughts are are ephemeral all thoughts are insubstantial

397
01:27:56,280 --> 01:28:03,840
doesn't mean they're not helpful it doesn't mean that we don't need them but it does mean that we don't have

398
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:09,159
to hold on and grab on to them thoughts are helpful and

399
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:14,600
useful until they're not so we need them but there's a way in

400
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:20,639
which we are often kind of like repeating repeating or kind of like obsessing in a certain kind of way and

401
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:28,320
that's extra you don't have to do that so this idea of

402
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:33,360
comparing that we humans All Humans

403
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:38,679
Do often when we do this compared not always but not for everybody sometimes

404
01:28:38,679 --> 01:28:44,199
we come out feeling like this inadequate in some kind of way this inner critic

405
01:28:44,199 --> 01:28:51,639
gets activated in so many different ways and there's a way in which we can

406
01:28:51,639 --> 01:28:57,440
recognize oh this is just comparing we can use this recognition of comparing to

407
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:03,440
connect with other people this is what humans do doesn't mean I'm a bad person and just because this person is

408
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:09,560
comparing themselves to me and they seem to have come up with a particular evaluation doesn't mean we have to go

409
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:15,360
along with it doesn't mean other people have to go along with our evaluations either

410
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:20,920
right and we can work with comparing we don't have to make it go away we can

411
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:27,440
recognize that when the comparisons are shown up a certain way it influences

412
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:33,040
us actually everything influences us but maybe that's a whole other Dharma talk

413
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:38,800
but this idea that it's part of the way that we make this

414
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:44,760
self and we can use notice our comparing as a way to maybe soften the sense of

415
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:51,239
self so there's more ease and freedom we could do that with mindfulness practices or with some

416
01:29:51,239 --> 01:29:58,320
wisdom practi IES so I think I'll stop

417
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:04,679
there and I thank you for your attention and maybe I'll open it up and see if

418
01:30:04,679 --> 01:30:11,520
there's any questions or comments and then I'm recognizing that

419
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:17,320
I'm tethered here but the microphone is there so thank

420
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:23,840
you I don't know if anybody has a comment or a question or something they'd like to say

421
01:30:28,199 --> 01:30:34,440
okay maybe Bill if you have something or you don't have to but uh you're included

422
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:41,239
in the people are in of course um well going back to uh being on Retreat and

423
01:30:41,239 --> 01:30:46,600
then you know suddenly everything looks beautiful I'm it's kind of trivial but I

424
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:53,920
remember Gil once saying on r Treat Retreat even you're walking maybe at

425
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:59,600
Spirit Rock out in the uh Wilderness Area next to it on the

426
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:07,520
Hills Trails and you see a a crumpled candy wrapper that someone had

427
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:13,760
littered onto it even that can look beautiful

428
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:18,800
yes thank you Bill thank you right it's amazing right there are times we might

429
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:25,440
like think like oh my gosh how can somebody leave it there and I make it a whole story I'm always thinking that so

430
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:33,679
I but I try to remember that story g s that's good thank you Bill thank

431
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:37,840
you

432
01:31:40,159 --> 01:31:45,360
yes hi thanks for the talk so you talked about comparing and I guess you may have

433
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:51,800
answered a question already but my question was so how do you confront um these feelings of inadequacy or shame

434
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:58,560
name um I think he sort of said to sort of focus on the feeling in the present moment but I sort of noticed that with

435
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:04,719
myself and and some of the people I sort of compete with in sports and whatnot and and just sort of having feelings of

436
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:11,119
like inadequacy or or whatnot and constant Loop of comparing then he talked about counting I was like I'm not

437
01:32:11,119 --> 01:32:17,600
going to get past two or three it's exhausting but there's a feet I wouldn't attempt yeah yeah so I I will say that

438
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:23,600
I've given a number of talks on this so you could look up a like inner critic and I've done a number of series on it

439
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:30,600
but here's one thing that I didn't say that I'll offer right now often when the inner critic is up and running there is

440
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:37,600
this um there's this part of the voice it's like oh I'm doing it wrong or I'm not

441
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:42,840
enough or something like this but if we could ask this

442
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:48,800
question how am I right now you just ask that how am I right now

443
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:54,360
there's this way if how am I right now and which which we can like tune in to

444
01:32:54,360 --> 01:33:01,920
like how we are and feel how we are that is a way it's like it's an act of kindness and care to just turn towards

445
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:10,280
ourselves and how am I to do it with some care with some care instead of just

446
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:18,840
feeling like I'm this feeling of inadequacy or something like this so that's one thing is to just ask cuz

447
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:25,320
often we're asking like how could I do it better or what am I doing wrong or there's these types of questions that

448
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:31,320
are sometimes uh implicit in the background but to change the question to

449
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:36,880
how am I and then we might discover I'm sad I'm lonely I'm hungry I'm and that's

450
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:44,239
just how it is but it interrupts this feeling of inadequacy thank

451
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:51,280
you thank you um his question brought up for me one thing another suggestion you

452
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:58,360
made uh which was something like now I was struggling to remember exactly like how to phrase it U but it's something

453
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:05,119
like how is this act of comparing affecting how I'm relating or affecting

454
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:10,400
the situation or how I'm relating to others uh and I want to remember that but it doesn't

455
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:16,199
feel uh easy to remember in my mind this uh unless there's like

456
01:34:16,199 --> 01:34:21,719
a neater way of you know more succinct expression or

457
01:34:21,719 --> 01:34:27,920
something yeah a succinct way is to notice the yeah I I could give like a

458
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:34,639
talk on this I I'll say this succinctly and hopefully it'll make sense and if it doesn't we might have to work with this

459
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:40,800
a little bit there's the the way of looking like what is the way of looking

460
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:49,239
like what is the lens that we're looking through because the way of looking affects what's being seen so if we just

461
01:34:49,239 --> 01:34:56,320
ask ourselves what is the lens I'm seing things through maybe it's another way or what frame of reference am I using or

462
01:34:56,320 --> 01:35:04,639
something like this yeah cool thank you welcome okay okay so thank you all for
