1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:10,080
okay well I'm thinking that we should go ahead and get started according to my clock it's on

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,278
the hour so why don't we just start right away with the meditation and we'll

3
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:28,439
continue on um after that with our list of one so settling in finding a spot to

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:39,280
sit allowing yourself to ease into the Mind state of

5
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,879
meditation maybe taking a couple of long slow deep breaths and on the exhale just

6
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,920
allowing the body to settle more deeply into

7
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:02,760
itself so finding a natural feeling sitting posture or maybe lying down or

8
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,000
standing if you're comfortable doing so you can close the

9
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:25,119
eyes maybe softening a bit softening the face the

10
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:31,000
head shoulders letting them drop

11
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,439
down through the belly and the arms and legs just inviting a posture that's

12
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,159
upright and also

13
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,840
relaxed inclining the mind and the body toward each

14
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,560
perhaps allowing the attention to just naturally rest onto the sensations of

15
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:34,959
breathing in and out just to give the mind a simple

16
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,239
experience to connect with that's in the present

17
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:05,560
moment even if the mind mind is busy or if there are some emotions present

18
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:13,120
that's all fine we can just allow those and also sense the breath in order to

19
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,159
give the Mind something to rest with

20
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,840
and then inviting into your awareness a sense

21
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,400
of confidence in the process of

22
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,680
meditation so it doesn't have to be a large movement of mind maybe just

23
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:00,360
remembering that you do this because you know it has some good effects

24
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:15,879
letting this simple confidence or trust or faith be the foundation

25
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:47,400
and today we'll primarily be looking at our mind in this

26
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,800
meditation so in the realm of the mind there's kind of two things going on

27
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,400
there's how the mind is or what the content of the mind

28
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,400
is and then there's also how we are paying attention to that you know how is

29
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:18,560
the quality of the awareness that's observing that or being with

30
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:28,720
that and we'll actually start with how it is that we are attending to

31
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,639
our mind

32
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:42,038
so you might just notice if there is certain flavor to the way we're paying

33
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:53,120
attention is it tight is there wanting or not wanting sense of striving or a sense of

34
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,120
criticism

35
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:14,479
so I'm going to just offer three common flavors that we might

36
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:22,000
have that can color the mind and a

37
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,120
possible way to balance that out just so that we can kind of hone the

38
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:39,440
way that we're paying attention so it may be that we have some

39
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:47,080
degree of ill will in the mind you may be irritated about

40
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,319
something in the in our household this morning

41
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,520
or dreading something that we have to do later

42
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,440
some way the mind is in a little bit negative

43
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,759
State and sometimes we meet that by wishing it weren't that way so we add

44
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:24,919
kind of more ill will onto the ill will so the invitation is

45
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:30,319
to explicitly include a sense of warm

46
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:37,360
Acceptance in the mind maybe at first what we're accepting

47
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,319
is that the mind is in a state of ill will at least we can start with

48
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:50,120
accepting that and that's okay because it was

49
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,360
conditioned there were the conditions for it that's why it's

50
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:05,039
there and then maybe we can even accept what it is that we're a little

51
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:15,000
irritated about okay yeah we have a certain thing going on in our

52
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:26,080
relationship or something that needs to be done at least for now for this

53
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:35,279
meditation we can just include that except that part of the mind that part of our

54
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:48,200
life maybe the heating isn't working okay

55
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:09,000
another very common flavor in our mind that can color how we pay

56
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,640
attention is a sense of self-criticism or

57
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,120
self-doubt am I doing it

58
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,240
right am I

59
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:33,279
okay are we everyone else is more mindful than

60
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,959
me so this is also very common normal in a

61
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:54,320
sense and I would invite sense of respect as a natural

62
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,440
counterbalance you are sitting at this

63
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:10,640
moment that's pretty big deal you can respect that you made it to

64
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,920
the cushion or the chair you made it onto this live stream or this

65
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,760
recording right there is something worthy of respect

66
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,560
so just a little smile or

67
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,200
even wanting to

68
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,720
meditate you're engaging in a very beautiful and Noble

69
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:03,240
practice and all the other stuff about how we are in life how we made that

70
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:12,480
mistake we could think about that later maybe for now it's just really good to

71
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,120
be sitting here

72
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:47,880
maybe feeling the breath in and out again inviting KN through the

73
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:02,560
body and then a third flavor that we often carry in the

74
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,000
mind is a a kind of

75
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:15,480
striving so wanting to be more peaceful we wanting

76
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:22,040
to be really present wanting to get

77
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,720
concentrated so in a gentle form of course it's good to to wish these things

78
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,839
for ourselves but there's a way in which the

79
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:44,560
very wanting of them can bring a certain tightness into the mind we can feel that actually when

80
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:54,279
we're attuned to the mind so the natural counterbalance is to

81
00:12:54,279 --> 00:13:01,120
invite continue to invite ease into the mind

82
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,519
a little bit like those um toys where you put your finger into it it's kind of

83
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:17,880
a woven woven toy and when you put your finger in if you try to pull it

84
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,880
out it just tightens around the finger and to get it out you actually have to

85
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:30,040
push Inward and then gently remove the finger

86
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:37,800
so there's a way in which pushing just binds us up even more and it's actually through ease that

87
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,240
the mind can settle so there's really nowhere to go

88
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:50,560
nothing that needs to be done right now

89
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:05,800
so this is something that can be done at the beginning of a Sit is to notice the

90
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:12,839
attention the way we're being attentive and invite acceptance to

91
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:19,440
counter ill will respect to counter self-criticism

92
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:28,480
or self-doubt and ease to counter striving

93
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:36,199
I may not need to do all of them but I wanted to offer a whole

94
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,880
spread I actually consider these three acceptance respect and ease to be

95
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:55,240
different facets of meta different aspects of how we can

96
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,240
love

97
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:12,320
so just resting for a moment perhaps returning the attention to the breath

98
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:05,240
so now that the the way that we're paying attention is fairly

99
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:11,839
balanced we can look a little bit more carefully at the natural flow of what's

100
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,240
in the

101
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:25,839
mind so we might check if even now there's a sense of sensual

102
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,279
desire in the mind

103
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:43,319
or there may not be and then we feel what it's like to

104
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:50,040
have a mind that's not particularly influenced by sensual desire

105
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,798
there's no need to change how the mind is since we have our clear balanced

106
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:19,038
attention we just notice what it's like to have or not have desire in the mind

107
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:03,440
and we can do the same with any sense of anger or irritation or ill

108
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,200
will just looking with a balanced

109
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,240
attention what it's like when that flickers through the mind oh this is a

110
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,280
mind that's influenced by a Moment of

111
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,360
irritation or if that's not there oh this is what a mind is like when it

112
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,840
doesn't have any irritation in it interesting

113
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,640
interestingly this can also be done with

114
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:34,679
delusion we might think oh there's no way to see

115
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:40,559
delusion by its very nature but actually we

116
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:47,960
can we could see if the mind is busy with some kind of story that we

117
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,679
know isn't really true we just say oh

118
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,039
okay there's some delusion present in the mind

119
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:06,400
or if the mind's a little fuzzy or maybe it's not maybe it's quite

120
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,679
clear feels balanced and then we say okay this is a mind that is not strongly

121
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,399
influenced by delusion right now

122
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:55,159
and we can also notice the degree of concentration in the

123
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,360
mind is the Mind fairly well

124
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,880
gathered steady in the present

125
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:18,200
moment does it feel like an unstable molecule ready to fly apart at any

126
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,080
moment scattering off into its own thoughts as soon as my voice isn't

127
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:31,760
present and that's just one more thing to notice

128
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,799
oh this is what a scattered mind is like or this is what a fairly gathered mind

129
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:41,158
is like

130
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:18,640
it can be quite empowering to realize that we can simply observe how the mind

131
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,799
is and that's perfectly good

132
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:32,720
meditation in the words of aan sumo WR now it's like

133
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
this

134
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

135
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

136
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

137
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

138
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

139
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

140
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
e e

141
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:10,919
and there may be times when we observe our mind and we notice

142
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:20,120
that it's not particularly influenced by sensual desire or greed at this

143
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:27,279
moment and it's also not particularly influenced by hatred or ill will at this

144
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:36,000
moment nor does it seem to be strongly diluted

145
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,279
at this moment it's possible after a period of

146
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,679
meditation the mind is in in a state like

147
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,840
that given that liberation of mind is

148
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:58,960
said to be the absence of greed hatred and delusion

149
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,120
such a mind is somewhat close to

150
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:14,279
liberation of course we may have those Tendencies still working in the

151
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:22,000
mind but it may be that at this moment your mind is relatively

152
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,480
free we can appreciate that

153
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,440
realizing that can deepen our

154
00:28:53,720 --> 00:29:00,039
confidence so it may be that freedom is a relatively simple thing

155
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,039
something we could carry in our heart throughout the

156
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:18,640
day a place we could return to rest throughout the day

157
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,220
[Music]

158
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,349
[Music]

159
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:32,960
okay so first today I'd like to share a list that I

160
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,000
received this week because it relates uh to our our countdown theme if you

161
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,000
will so this is um The 12 Days of Christmas Buddhist

162
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,519
version on the 12th day of Christmas my true love gave to me 12 links

163
00:30:53,519 --> 00:31:02,200
arising 11 arahant laughing 10 Perfections growing nine deavas

164
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:08,120
dancing Eightfold Path a leading Seven Seas

165
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:14,440
seeing six doors as sensing five Training

166
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:21,399
precepts Four Noble Truths three precious gems two wings of

167
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:29,080
Awakening and a Buddha Neath a bow tree I thought it was pretty

168
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:35,279
good so um that takes us then today to our list of

169
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:42,720
one um I don't know how unusual this one item is but I can say that it's not

170
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:49,320
clearly defined uh anywhere in the sutas in kind of an analytical way and yet it

171
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:55,360
is incredibly important and so that is the word that is often translated as

172
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:02,039
mind or sometimes as heart or sometimes as heart mind and the word is

173
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:09,279
cheetah cheetah and it is to the degree that the terada teachings say it this

174
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:16,600
way um it is what gets liberated so it's not that you are going

175
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:23,440
to get liberated uh but your cheetah might your heart might get

176
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:31,320
liberated so this language of what I like to call all the Primacy of the mind

177
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:38,760
is very clear in the sutas so I'll read from quote from the

178
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:47,080
Buddha I do not see any other single thing that brings such woe as the Mind

179
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:54,399
cheetah that is Untamed uncontrolled unguarded and unrestrained such a mind

180
00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:01,080
indeed brings great woe I do not see any other single thing that

181
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:07,120
brings such happiness as the mind that is tamed controlled guarded and

182
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,279
restrained such a mind indeed brings great

183
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:20,080
happiness so I don't think we need to see this in a restrictive way but more in a sense of not letting the mind run

184
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,519
rampant over our own heart and others so we see that it is about the

185
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:31,320
mind um the Buddhist teachings emphasize that the key is right here in

186
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,360
the mind or the heart and how the cheetah is strongly influences the

187
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:44,080
amount of happiness or suffering that we have in a given moment this is also stated up front in

188
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:52,480
the right in the first two stanzas of the dapada so all experiences preceded by

189
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:59,760
mind led by mind made by mind speak or act with a corrupt mind and suffering

190
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:06,159
follows as the Wagon Wheel follows the hoof of the ox all experiences proceeded

191
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:12,878
by mind led by mind made by mind speak or act with a peaceful mind and

192
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:21,000
happiness follows like a never departing Shadow so it's relatively simple um not

193
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,960
easy to do but relatively simple that if we have peace in the heart then What

194
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,000
comes forth from that is somehow related to

195
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,440
happiness for ourselves and others so where can we learn more about

196
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,960
the chetah and how it fits into the path it's effectively threaded everywhere

197
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:54,599
throughout the teachings the word chetah if you search for that there's you know many many instances of it um but maybe

198
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:01,680
the most prominent place where it's stated directly is right in the foundational text on the cultivation of

199
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,240
mindfulness the Sati patana suta so there the Buddha identified the chitta

200
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,640
as one of four areas of experience where we can establish

201
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:19,440
mindfulness so it's um worthwhile to look at our mind as we did in the

202
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:26,079
sitting so I think it's it's noteworthy that we can observe our mind through the

203
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,200
instructions of this which I'll talk a little bit more about in a moment we can

204
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,359
observe our mind as a set of Shifting changing mental qualities now that's

205
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:44,880
what we're that's what we see when we're mindful of the cheetah rather than say an individual

206
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,280
experience of I you know there isn't just one thing going on in the mind

207
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,079
there isn't just one one Experience One self that we could point to and this is

208
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:04,880
actually quite profound although it may not sound that way but the the instructions in this

209
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:12,960
establishment of su and the establishment of mindfulness are simply to observe a series of qualities in the

210
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,640
mind and notice whether they're there or whether they're not um and they are some of the ones

211
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:26,119
that we looked at in the in the sitting so for example uh sensual desire or

212
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:33,960
sometimes it's translated as lust we just notice is that present in the mind right now or not is the Mind

213
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,240
actually says something like is the Mind influenced by it at this moment or not

214
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,560
and the same for hatred and the same for delusion those are the three kind of

215
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,000
overarching difficulties that we have in the mind but we're also then supposed to

216
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,200
notice if the mind is uh contracted it's kind of small and contracted or if it's

217
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,920
uh scattered and Broad uh the Mind feels different at different times doesn't it

218
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,079
sometimes it feels very narrow uh focused um sometimes it feels uh

219
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:16,839
scattered or broad sometimes it feels um elevated kind of lofty in a sense and sometimes

220
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:22,720
not so much um we're also supposed to notice if the mind is uh concentrated

221
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,359
you know in the sense of whether it is gathered and um

222
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:34,520
yeah kind of organized or is it uh unconcentrated scattered flipping around

223
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:41,960
to different things and interestingly we're also supposed to notice if the mind is liberated or not liberated at a

224
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:48,480
given moment so that's something that we can detect also I don't see a difference between

225
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,680
noticing these things on or off the cushion you know we can sit and you know

226
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:00,240
when we're sitting peacefully quietly we have maybe a little bit more um Clarity

227
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,680
in how we can Precision in how we can observe the Mind from moment to moment

228
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,960
but we can definitely observe it also in daily life while you're cooking or

229
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:17,240
cleaning or even with enough practice while we're talking we can observe how

230
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:25,200
the mind is whether it's leaning towards something whether it's leaning away what what emotions are coming up um and the

231
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,319
instruction in this suta at least on my fulness is just to know just to know how

232
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:36,640
it is with no judgment see how the mind is there's a

233
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:44,000
certain importance to you using modern language to taking data about our mind

234
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,000
you know noticing how does the Mind get upset when it is angry what does it feel like instead of immediately saying oh

235
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,079
the mind has anger I'm not supposed to be angry I'm a spiritual person I'd better quickly do some meta practice to

236
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:03,079
eliminate at that anger U there's a little more leeway in this suta where

237
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:08,160
you know as long as we're not acting on the anger like it says in the DAP versus

238
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,040
we act on anger then then yes there will be some suffering but if we simply are knowing that the mind is in an angry

239
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,119
State that's important we can learn what it's like what does it feel like U

240
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:27,040
what's the what are the consequences internally of having that so it's important this is kind of a data taking

241
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:34,920
EX exercise uh to know about the moods of the Mind the flavor how things come and go it includes the emotional tone of

242
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,920
the mind it includes the cognitive tone of the mind and then also once we see these

243
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,440
qualities the suta ask asks us to observe them arising and passing away

244
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:54,560
and now on on the one hand we see how the conditioning of the mind works we see what conditions lead toward certain

245
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:02,160
states of mind and what conditions lead toward more peace states of mind and also at a just a fundamental level we're

246
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:09,280
learning that mind states are impermanent you know there's there's no mind state that has persisted since the

247
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:15,800
beginning of your life and probably so not since the beginning of today so we see that all these things

248
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:21,920
are coming and going and it's it's um important to uh have the process of

249
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:29,920
beginning to disidentify with the Mind beginning to see it as ah conditioned influenced by different things this is

250
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:36,960
from anali's book on Sati patana sustained contemplation of the

251
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,839
mind will expose the degree to which what one takes to be one's own mind is

252
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:50,520
in fact influenced by external conditions realizing the impermanent and

253
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:57,960
conditioned nature of the Mind leads toward nonattachment and nonidentification so

254
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:04,760
it's interesting right it is in a sense our own mind it's not somebody else's mind and it's a huge influence on our

255
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,079
experience but we see that actually um we have a lot of conditions that have

256
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:17,920
come into it from the culture from our family from our experience from our upbringing is it really ours

257
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:25,440
really um some of us are with uh family at a time of year like this and don't

258
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,599
you see where your habits come from If You observe your relatives so you know

259
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:40,280
um it's something that we can uh See Clearly as having a lot of different influences coming in so interestingly we

260
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:47,599
we do observe the mind but we also cultivate the mind the is to be cultivated along the Buddhist path it's

261
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:56,079
important to it does change over time and we can refine it we can hone it we can elevate it we can um yeah we can

262
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,200
refine it and interestingly these two tasks of observing the mind and

263
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:08,119
cultivating the mind are similar um simply because mindfulness has a way of

264
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:14,480
enhancing what is wholesome and diminishing what is UNH wholesome it's kind of the magic of mindfulness so

265
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:21,000
interestingly the cheetah develops or refines by seeing its qualities and by

266
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,720
also seeing what is not present so it's interesting that we're supposed to see what's there and what's not there

267
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:35,520
and once we've seen this clearly um the only maybe the only clear instructions on what to actually do with the mind uh

268
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,200
we can see in in the ananti Su on mindfulness of breathing we are said

269
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:48,800
that it said that we should Gladden our mind so to the degree that we can we should influence it positively and then

270
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:55,240
we should also um work on concentrating the mind I'm having some degree of some

271
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:01,520
some presence in the mind and then eventually this will lead to liberating the mind I don't think we have to do

272
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,880
that exactly so we observe the mind we try to have some kind of positive

273
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,880
influence on it so for example during the sit I asked us to bring in our confidence in the practice our

274
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:19,119
confidence in the process of the path and then we gather the Mind somehow and

275
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:26,119
you know try to kind of keep it in the roughly in the present moment but that's kind of it with the mind of course

276
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:33,119
there's infinite detail detail on that in suas so many practices we can do but I think at a broad level that's it we

277
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:40,920
strengthen the Mind through all of this and a strong cheetah is linked with the ability to stay with uncomfortable

278
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:46,200
experience and hence be able to penetrate through various habit patterns

279
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:52,920
essentially what we're doing is becoming free of the mind's conditioning so that the mind is able to be present even

280
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,160
though it has all these influences from our family from our culture Etc

281
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:05,400
so this all of this maybe could be called maturing the mind a few days ago I talked about a list of four uh

282
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:13,680
qualities of mind that we cultivate and that we emulate in others and the kind of collective term for those four was

283
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,200
mature conduct you might remember so we're maturing Mind through all this

284
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,520
observation and this has an impact on us of course but also on our

285
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:31,880
relationships um you know the more free we are of all the habits and patterns and reactivities that have been put into

286
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:37,440
our mind the more present we can be for others the more likely that our response

287
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,920
is going to be Compassion or wisdom or love something that's in the realm of

288
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:49,960
Freedom rather than anger reactivity control manipulation Envy greed the

289
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:57,319
other things that we do so when we're less stuck on our stuff we can meet others where they are unruffled on um

290
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:03,440
and be helpful to them so the free mind is highly available highly responsible

291
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,960
highly responsive responsible also and so it's compassionate it's

292
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,040
attuned and so then you know what is the fruit of all this cultivation there's a

293
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:21,200
wonderful term in the teachings chto vuti liberation of mind which is one of

294
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:29,200
the qualities of an nun but we can we can feel it too anytime the mind is relatively free of greed hatred and

295
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:35,839
delusion there's a nice image from the teachings let me just read

296
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:41,960
it just as if there were a lake in a mountain recess clear limpid and

297
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,400
undisturbed so that a person with good eyesight standing on the bank could see

298
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:54,200
shells gravel and Pebbles and also shs of fish swimming about and resting so

299
00:45:54,200 --> 00:46:01,079
too a meditator understands this is suffering this is the arising of suffering this is the cessation of

300
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:08,880
suffering and this is the path of practice leading to the cessation of suffering so just as if we're looking

301
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:16,520
into clear water and seeing everything that's there the shells the fish swimming around uh when the mind and the

302
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:22,160
heart are clear aware present we can just look at the contents of life and

303
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:29,760
see okay that one's Dua there's the reason it's happening there's some clinging this is freedom these are and

304
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:37,559
these are some of the qualities of the path we see clearly in experience the four noble truths and that allows us to

305
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:44,280
navigate quite easily away from the suffering and toward the end of suffering

306
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:50,880
so as we go throughout our day see the Mind clearly know its qualities know

307
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:58,680
that there's suffering know that there's the end of suffering be with whichever of those we can hopefully leaning toward

308
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:05,200
the end of suffering we can do it in the kitchen with our relatives we can do it while taking a walk while

309
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:11,000
sitting so remembering what the Buddha said at the very beginning I do not see

310
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,160
any other single thing that brings such happiness as the mind that is tamed

311
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:25,240
controlled guarded and restrained maybe we would just say simply the mind that is well observed clearly seen such a

312
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:32,800
mind indeed brings great happiness so thank you all for this week

313
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:41,640
of countdown and I wish you much happiness thank you
