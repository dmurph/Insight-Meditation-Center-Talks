1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:09,280
so warm greetings for our meditation time

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:17,600
together and um

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:25,519
as i sit down to be here with you all and i'm thinking about

4
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:33,760
two things that uh and that is sacred presence

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,480
that which is present that feels deeply respect worthy inspiring

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,960
meaningful and sacred absence the absence which is

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:54,640
special respect worthy inspiring

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:03,280
and in this practice uh there's a very important role of absence what i call today

9
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,479
sacred absence and to recognize the absence of

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,520
clinging attachment hate preoccupation

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,360
and to recognize that absence is special respect worthy inspiring

12
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:33,439
it really helps open up this path of meditation and then with that sacred absence

13
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,720
the way that we are aware of what is present can have a sacred quality

14
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,759
maybe not exactly because what we're attending to is maybe sacred in

15
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:55,920
some way but the way that we're present for it our sacred presence our presence our attention

16
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,880
has qualities that are sacred and special and not to be overlooked

17
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:11,360
and there's always something here as we meditate which is absent

18
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,400
and uh if you go back even you know over your recent life

19
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,520
there have probably been things that you've been caught up in reacting to

20
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,239
consumed with driven by troubled by that those troubles and

21
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,400
those preoccupations maybe they've faded away and they're not here anymore

22
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,080
and it's possible to somehow be aware of their absence

23
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,120
and in that absence to have more room for awareness for

24
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,440
attention in that absence to receive

25
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:01,120
more fully the experience of breathing in that absence to connect more fully to

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,560
breathing and even in the much short term

27
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,280
if you're thinking about something in meditation and you're able to let go of it there's the absence of that

28
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,879
thinking there might be the absence of the drive

29
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:27,840
to think or the desire or the resentment or the whatever it was inspiring the thinking

30
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,920
to start recognizing the absence is a very important part of the deeper

31
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,159
dimensions of this anapanasati

32
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,239
and then not just to recognize the absence but recognize it as an opportunity to

33
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,480
bring have a sacred awareness a greater awareness and for the purpose

34
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:04,239
of this meditation for our breathing simply aware and

35
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:11,120
kind of committed to breathing in and breathing out

36
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:19,519
with awareness awareness awaringly

37
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:28,000
so to take a assume a meditation posture

38
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and close your eyes

39
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,840
and and here we are there's a lot of things

40
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,680
absent just being used to meditate

41
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,000
for the time being the absence of maybe the busyness of the day or the

42
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,040
concerns that we have to things we have to do during the day

43
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:11,840
physically those things are not here now in our body working them

44
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:20,639
maybe some other concerns that you have for the day you can put up on a shelf and put aside for now

45
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,639
and let them be absent because they'll be picked up later

46
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:39,840
to help let go of things to be here to take a few long slow deep breaths

47
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,400
maybe three quarters full as you breathe in

48
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,840
and four fifths emptying the lungs as you exhale

49
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:21,840
and as you exhale to relax the body the whole frame

50
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:39,520
letting your breathing return to normal and relaxing

51
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,800
some more on the exhale and not only feeling the release of tension and holding

52
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,759
but to appreciate the absence of that holding

53
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:03,840
so to soften the belly

54
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:17,840
perhaps you can soften your chest

55
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:45,840
yeah relaxing and softening your shoulders

56
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:59,840
and calming the muscles of your face

57
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,840
and cooling down the

58
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,039
agitation associated with thinking

59
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,840
calming the thinking mind

60
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,320
and then appreciating absence not so much that you have to think about

61
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,200
what is absent but maybe there's some way you could intuit

62
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:12,480
the absence space the absence the freed up time the freedom thinking

63
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,839
the freedom attention

64
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,839
that's not preoccupied with the things that you have been preoccupied with

65
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:32,240
and here to allow this absence to become fuller

66
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,240
letting go of thoughts ideas

67
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,839
an absence which is related to the simplicity of this moment

68
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,800
just here now in

69
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:05,440
the sacred absence in which you

70
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,399
make room for your body's

71
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,480
breathing allowing in a sense the experience of breathing

72
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:33,839
to fill the space of awareness

73
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,040
a sacred absence that allows for sacred presence

74
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,120
a sacred attention

75
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:04,240
and when you find yourself thinking and you let go of it appreciate

76
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,880
whatever absence of thinking that then follows

77
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,839
and allow the breathing into that absence

78
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,720
so breathing begins to fill more and more

79
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:35,920
your field of awareness as if awareness fills the universe just

80
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
breathing

81
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:36,320
keep filling the absence with your breathing your experience body's experience of

82
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,079
breathing so that this sacred absence is not filled with

83
00:13:42,079 --> 00:14:03,839
something else filled with thinking and wanting fantasy

84
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
so

85
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:24,240
whatever you're caught up in and thinking about beyond the edges of it is also

86
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,360
sacred absence

87
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:39,360
let go of your thoughts and preoccupations your tensions your holdings

88
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:48,240
let go into the great absence

89
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,200
fill that absence with the experience of breathing

90
00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:03,840
allowing yourself to become very simple and quiet just breathing

91
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,159
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

92
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,720
one form of sacred absence

93
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:44,240
is to make the heart as wide as the world

94
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:51,919
make lots of space in your heart in your care and your love and your

95
00:27:51,919 --> 00:28:00,640
good will so there's a place inside of you

96
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,159
for all beings

97
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,880
and so to clear the space within

98
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:19,840
so that there's room for you to consider relate to

99
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:27,519
hold in your care others

100
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,120
and for them to fill the space of your heart

101
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:41,200
means to be very simple allowing them to be as they are

102
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,880
maybe a sacred presence

103
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:58,080
that everyone is respect worthy everyone in some way may be

104
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:05,200
independent or even how they're behaving some way deep inside something beautiful

105
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:13,840
and inspiring even if it's just a seed that's waiting to germinate

106
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:25,279
in sacred absence it within you that allows you to receive

107
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:32,880
and be present in a fuller caring way for others

108
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:44,320
and you don't have to say these words but maybe a care and a good will

109
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:51,600
that these words express or touch on

110
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,880
may all beings be happy

111
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:08,640
may all beings be safe

112
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,679
may all beings be peaceful

113
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,840
may all beings be free

114
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,919
and may we live caring for the welfare and happiness

115
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,840
of those around us

116
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:50,399
may this meditation practice

117
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,158
provide inspiration and ability

118
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:02,240
to walk through the world with care and good will

119
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:19,840
may all beings be well

120
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,880
you
