1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:12,540
so hello and welcome to this meditation session and to the talk that will follow

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:20,100
and as an introduction the um I want to use an analogy

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,480
that if um

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,920
you learn to float in water or learn to swim in water and then can feel very

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,800
comfortable and confident in the water and so that you can flip over on your back

6
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,160
and float maybe you're even in a salted body of

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,039
water or Salt Lake salted Lake or something that you're with the salt

8
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,860
we're even much more buoyant and just the stretch back lay and Float On The Water

9
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,100
and there's a way in which then we are trusting the the buoyancy of the water

10
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,200
the the water we know how to rest in the water be in the water and there's a kind

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,200
of a trust to it people who swim are trusting that they'll float and but they don't even

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,040
think about the trust they're just so obvious it's like that you know it's uh you know it's just so taken for granted

13
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,280
almost a second nature but there is a trust

14
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,340
and same way when we do Dharma practice

15
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,380
we are trusting we're learning to trust something that holds us up the word

16
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,500
Dharma uh the etymology of it literally means that which supports something that holds up

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:51,479
and um and so the Dharma holds us up and uh to be a little bit more practical

18
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:58,259
about it it's the practice that holds us up we can we can trust the practice

19
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,439
and you know that's not always so obvious but over time people who

20
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,679
practice a lot learn more and more that if they practice if they stay in the practice

21
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:17,640
even if they don't see the benefits immediately they can trust the practice it's like saying you can trust honesty

22
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:26,940
you can trust being present you can trust being present and non-reactive

23
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,580
there's something that deep that arises that's available that comes with that

24
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,340
kind of practice and but more broadly people will trust

25
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,760
the Dharma sometimes and that means trusting some of the basic principles

26
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,780
trusting non-harming trusting being ethical

27
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,599
trusting kindness compassion and

28
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:00,000
and so to put the put the meditation practice

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,220
in the contest context of this kind of trust and if you're new to meditation the

30
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:15,180
trust obviously and appropriately won't be there but as we keep practicing the trust

31
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:22,500
infuses the the practice story is connected to the the practice that we

32
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,459
do and that trust uh we're trusting something the Dharma the practice

33
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:36,060
that is a um Association of meaning

34
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,099
we're assigning a certain kind of

35
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:48,900
characteristic to um to the meditation the characteristic

36
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,680
being that it's not just our own efforts there's something else very profound maybe even more important than what we

37
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,379
do that holds us up maybe it becomes the practice becomes

38
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:08,360
second nature to float in the practice in the Dharma

39
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:14,120
so with that as an introduction you can

40
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:24,680
maybe take a posture assume a posture where the posture

41
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,120
is a posture of trust

42
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,460
posture that you can somehow relax very deeply

43
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,060
knowing or as if you know

44
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,060
that you're going to be in a trustworthy safe supported

45
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:58,259
during the meditation how much is the meditation will support

46
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:06,919
you no matter what happens trust the meditation trust the mindfulness

47
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:16,560
trust the keep showing up and being present

48
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:25,638
don't trust the reactivity don't trust the judgments the bias the fears

49
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,500
but trust the oh with a clear

50
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,080
honest awareness that there are judgments and fears

51
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,960
reactivity trust the practice of attention

52
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,280
trust awareness

53
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,539
taking a few long slow deep breaths

54
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:10,620
breathing in deeply preparing yourself for going into the water or into

55
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:19,440
a delightful place where you can trust if water is not a good analogy Maybe

56
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,759
your mattress is trusting going to bed laying there

57
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:39,020
breathing in deeply and long and relaxing exhale softening your body

58
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,740
letting the breathing return to normal

59
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:27,500
maybe on the exhale relaxing into your body

60
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:34,319
maybe like you're lowering yourself into a pool of water

61
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,319
as you exhale lower yourself into your body

62
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:11,099
and in this body of yours is there some location in the body

63
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:16,740
that you associate with a kind of trust or confidence that I've been talking

64
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:24,680
about when you trust the deeply

65
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,460
where in your body does that seem to live

66
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,100
and so sitting here maybe breathing through this place

67
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:37,699
breathing from it breathing with the trust

68
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,320
that being aware being present

69
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,720
is trustworthy more than anything else for these minutes

70
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,620
and if you wonder away if you wander away from that place of trust

71
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:02,940
then remember when you remember remember that place come back to that trust

72
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,519
and let the trust be the source

73
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,120
or the support

74
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,660
for this awareness practice we do

75
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:51,120
being aware being attentive and mindfulness Here and

76
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:58,340
Now not contending with anything

77
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:05,899
opposing or favoring anything just aware

78
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,140
aware of the breathing

79
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,140
the body

80
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,500
and maybe in the middle of the awareness

81
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,679
can there be Trust

82
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:47,360
you trust the awareness floating in the awareness

83
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:56,299
not so much doing awareness

84
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:02,840
but resting in it allowing it floating

85
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:34,278
and then as we come to the end of sitting

86
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:42,299
a meditation where trust has been evoked

87
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:48,059
there are other things to trust when we trust other things than just awareness

88
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:53,419
that we trust when we're in the Dharma

89
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,840
who we can trust generosity

90
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:09,539
being generous trust kindness

91
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,440
friendliness

92
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,640
trust compassion and care

93
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:40,679
especially when the opposite of those are strong for us we have to be careful not to trust those

94
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:47,460
we have to learn to practice with them and be wise about it but the idea of entrusting ourselves to

95
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:55,980
them giving ourselves over to Being Greedy or miserly being unkind

96
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:03,419
mean angry hostile uncaring

97
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,360
in the Dharma this is what is dangerous

98
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:17,159
and where our safety is found is in the generosity and kindness and

99
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,520
care

100
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:29,640
and when we trust those it turns out that it's easier to trust

101
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:37,080
being aware it's also a more wonderful and wondrous

102
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:43,220
to be aware in the context

103
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:51,320
of wishing well to others Wishing Well to oneself

104
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:57,000
may it be that your Trust of the Dharma your trust of

105
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:04,620
mindfulness is strengthened

106
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,720
with your good will well wishing to others

107
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,400
may it be that

108
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:20,700
you wish well to those people in your life

109
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,019
those you encounter

110
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,159
May others be happy

111
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:37,580
May others be safe

112
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:47,480
May others be peaceful

113
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,919
May others be free

114
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:03,200
and may I may I trust enough May each of us trust enough

115
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,580
to float on those wishes to act on those wishes

116
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:18,139
may we benefit bring benefit and Welfare to others

117
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,419
[Music]

118
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:41,520
thank you so this is the last talk on the theme of

119
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:48,260
meaning in the connection to doing practice doing meditation practice

120
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:55,140
and the meaning is the assigning of value purpose

121
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:01,559
um interpretations to uh

122
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:09,480
our meditation practice to Buddhist practice and there's many different assigning of

123
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:15,539
purpose um value that we can give to it and I've

124
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:22,440
said this already but for example someone might go and we have some kind of illness and the doctor says you need

125
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,720
to find some way to have less stress in your life I think you should meditate

126
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,820
and so the assigned meaning and purpose of meditation is that it's for

127
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:40,740
distressing and the primary interpretation understanding of what meditation is is a form of de-stressing

128
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:46,919
someone else might find that they are struggling at work because they have to

129
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:52,200
give regularly Little Talks publicly to a large group

130
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,679
of people at work and they are petrified really afraid and they stumbling over the words it's very hard for them to do

131
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:04,799
it and they think I need to find some way to calm

132
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,360
down and to work with my fear and so someone suggests that they try mindfulness meditation

133
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:18,539
partly to calm down but partly to kind of get a handle on what's really going on there for them and and to kind of

134
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:24,659
work through the fear or learn to hold the fear in a different way and not be hooked into it

135
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:32,039
and so that becomes the assigned meaning purpose value of it is to help them work with their fear

136
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:37,759
someone else might feel that in some

137
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:45,899
clear way they have been suffering much of their life there's been a sense of heaviness

138
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:51,000
or despair or or strain that they kind of live with and

139
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,580
even when they go on vacation there's something not quite right there's a dissatisfaction

140
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:03,179
and then they hear maybe some Buddhist teaching in a classic little example for some people is they hear the teachings

141
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:09,779
of the four noble truths and they say wow no one's ever talked about so so putting

142
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:15,299
front and center that there's there is suffering in this world and everyone I've talked to before is trying

143
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:21,120
to get away from it or say it's not really there it's kind of trying to paint a nice picture of how wonderful

144
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,640
this world is and I just see suffering everywhere and hear these teachings say

145
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:34,080
yes there is suffering but they didn't stop there they said there was a cause and a possibility of

146
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,480
freedom from that suffering and they have a path they have a practice for doing that

147
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:45,600
and that just kind of um so now so that excited them that kind

148
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,539
of void them and uh and kind of did yes this is what I want to do and motivated

149
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:57,240
them so now the assigned meaning purpose value of meditation has to do with some

150
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,940
of the deeper existential issues of being a human being that that person has

151
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:08,820
some people do the practice of meditation do other things that somehow

152
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:15,118
open their mind dramatically release them from ordinary kind of states of

153
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,480
being in the world where it's so strong me versus you and so strong like we have

154
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:28,460
to kind of just kind of chase after our thoughts or whatever our thoughts chase after us or very strong sense of kind of

155
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:35,460
alienation from everything or for the world or all kinds of ways in which people live

156
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:41,339
and somehow something they do a time in nature

157
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:46,618
time with a lover taking a psychedelic or

158
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:54,000
meditating and in meditation deeper and deeper they might get released

159
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,280
from so much of the holding patterns and tightness and constrictions of their of

160
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,859
their mind their clinging their wanting their fear and they start having a taste a feeling

161
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:10,980
an experience of what it's like to not have any of those present to be able to

162
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:18,480
breathe easily to feel effects of freedom to feel a sense of intimacy with the world a very different relatedness

163
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:25,079
to the world around us and to other people that it feels so much more meaningful

164
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:33,420
than anything else meaningful perhaps because the alternative way of being hurts is challenging is stressful

165
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:39,180
and it feels really good it feels healthy it feels more natural

166
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:45,180
to not be caught up in the fears and their desires and their greeds and the conceits that we can have happen

167
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:50,460
and wow this is Health this is psychological spiritual health

168
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:56,400
this some people it's not just psychological It Feels So pervasive throughout their life pervasive

169
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:03,420
throughout their Consciousness and how they touch the world or see the world or perceive everything that to call it

170
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:09,240
psychological seems to limit it to something kind of bounded or small

171
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:16,200
that this is big this is everything and um and so now the assigned meaning

172
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:22,980
to the meditation is that it's a way of living from that place or being

173
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:28,260
connected to it or finding it or or practicing in a way that

174
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:34,800
um is kind of uh attuned to something that's more than

175
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,560
psychological well-being and health but some kind of spiritual kind of or broad

176
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:47,339
existential way of being and so there's all these different levels or layers or ways of assigning

177
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:52,859
meaning and purpose and value and and understanding of what meditation is

178
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:58,260
and uh none of them are wrong they're all kind of wonderful it's

179
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:06,480
important for each person to find where it is for them right now so they can do it do that way well and engage well with

180
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,640
that each of them have kind of little different ways of practicing different orientations different

181
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:19,920
focuses for what the mindfulness can be um but for the topic for today is the

182
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,619
way in which meditation the meaning of meditation the assigned

183
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:32,700
value of it or the dissociation we have with it um it can be with what we what some

184
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:39,060
people might call the sacred what is most sacred and that's of course a big word that

185
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:45,780
some Buddhists don't care for we don't hardly I don't think there's any obvious Buddhist word that you know Pali word

186
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:51,540
that can translate our sacred but except maybe if we want to use the word Dharma

187
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:58,079
and um or sometimes the word noble is kind of used that way sometimes

188
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,320
but I like the word sacred because it's not so clear what exactly it means but

189
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:14,180
it has to do with our ultimate value what we what we see and understand and and Orient ourselves to that uh that

190
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:21,240
touches all aspects of our life it's kind of the heart or the source or the

191
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:27,420
the context for how we want to live our life that kind of what what defines our

192
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,640
life or what's value what validates something or our whole life the whole

193
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:40,020
existence it um it is all inclusive and um and my kind of favorite

194
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:48,000
definition of what is sacred in our Buddhist practice is an awareness that leaves nothing out

195
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,820
as soon as there's a selection process that says no that I'm not going to be aware of that I'm going to exclude that

196
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:59,280
is not acceptable for me to bring attention to this open clear mindfulness

197
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:06,599
too then we've kind of shut off from We're shut off from the sacred and what is most sacred is when the

198
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:14,940
awareness is all encompassing nothing it doesn't mean we agree with everything or condone everything but the awareness can

199
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:22,440
hold it all and we trust that awareness and then within that wide universe of

200
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:29,460
awareness that we float in that we live in that we trust and then we find our way with wisdom

201
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,800
with whatever is going on and if we have to say no to something we say no but but

202
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,260
it all held so and but other people have other ideas

203
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:45,480
of what is sacred or sacred is not the right word is Ultimate the what it says

204
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,940
ultimate value for us or what we are committed to

205
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:57,420
um to put at the center of our life some people put family at the center and

206
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:05,400
with family maybe is a Love or the connection or the sense of responsibility or devotion or some

207
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,220
people put of course put work some people put being of service to others

208
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:16,260
than his ultimate some people it's a connection to God if you belong you have

209
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:23,000
a theistic orientation and um and um but in in the in Dharma practice

210
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:31,380
at some point what becomes can become Central for some people is the Dharma itself the practice itself

211
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:37,200
and so at that point it's so ultimate so like the center like what gives the most

212
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,599
meaning the most valuable most purpose um to our lives that that's where we

213
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,880
want to have our life come from and be supported by and you know everything has

214
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:55,140
to be connected to this Dharma then one of the reasons for that is we've learned that anything other than

215
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:00,240
that of what we understand to be the Dharma non-clinging anything other than

216
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:07,859
non-clinging that involves clinging is less healthy is less less satisfying less meaningful

217
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:14,880
less you know just it hurts so when so at some point to the

218
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:22,260
meditation then becomes not something that we have to do and add to our life it becomes our life

219
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:29,640
and there's a wonderful transition or switch that can happen where rather than asking the question

220
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:36,540
how can I bring my practice into my life meditation is great but I want to know how I'm going to retweet is great but

221
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:43,260
how do I bring this practice into my life and that's a beautiful question I love when people ask that question

222
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:49,079
but at some point the questions changes at some point the question beat the

223
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:56,339
equipment becomes um how would I bring my life into my practice

224
00:41:56,339 --> 00:42:01,740
The Practice Center Stage the practice is the stage

225
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:07,680
and the question is you know how do I bring the audience how do I bring the visitors how to bring everything up on

226
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:14,760
the stage to be included there rather than you know our ordinary life is the stage

227
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:21,240
and the practice is one of the people in the audience that gets invited in to be part of part of the

228
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:28,020
play so um so to then to trust this to have

229
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:33,119
faith in it to have confidence in it is one of the possibilities

230
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:40,260
in this topic this theme of meaning where do that the meaning is that this

231
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:45,480
is what I trust this is what I have faith in this is what I have confidence in

232
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:52,020
this is where I have certainty that this is this is the right place for me to be

233
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:59,940
the center the focus the root of my life and some people at that point will feel

234
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:05,819
well you know wait a minute I'm being disloyal to my family for example or you know I

235
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:11,099
have to love them and to have something else be have more Central seems like a betrayal

236
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:17,700
and this is my proposal is that that doesn't have to be betrayal

237
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:23,400
the love you have for the World for family the

238
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,520
uh and other things that's important for you they can remain just as important to

239
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,660
always as they are now there's no diminishment of importance

240
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:41,220
but more important is the Dharma is the practice of

241
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:47,040
mindfulness the awareness practice this that's that's more Central

242
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:53,940
and and rather than diminishing the love and the care the responsibility

243
00:43:53,940 --> 00:44:01,319
the devotion towards the things that are important you were we float in the Dharma it holds

244
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:06,960
us up so we can do those things are worthwhile we can do them better

245
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:15,780
it doesn't diminish their importance it just makes them richer and more valuable and we we come to it as a better person

246
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:21,599
so it is safe to put the Dharma at the center of your life more important than anything else

247
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:30,380
because it's the water that we float in and how wonderful to float in that water

248
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:36,000
then you can be a lifeguard if need be but if you haven't learned to float

249
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,619
you're not going to save a lot of people
