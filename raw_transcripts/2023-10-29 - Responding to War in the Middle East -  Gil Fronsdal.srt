1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,480
good morning and so thank you Martha and thank you

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:12,360
Jill for all your help with these potlucks path I feel are important part of our community life those of you like

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:20,119
to share in the community life of IMC staying and being hanging out for those are wonderful

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,640
way so as I think some of you know

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,840
that uh ever since the Hamas invasion of uh Israel I think my public talks

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:43,680
have been a response to that in some way or other and um and I'll continue that

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:51,120
today but I'd like to do maybe a preface to it all that maybe is important to

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:01:00,760
understand that I do so as a Buddhist teacher grounded in Buddhist values as I

9
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,280
understand them and as someone who doesn't live with the

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,360
urgency of uh violence that's happening in the

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,960
present lethal violence that's happening in the present if I was living with that

12
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:24,280
urgency I would probably if I was teaching at all I

13
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:31,119
would teach maybe differently and um

14
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,360
and coming here to speak about this today I become certainly alarmed by

15
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,040
what's happening in the Middle East but I'm also alarmed by how divisiveness is

16
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,920
spreading around the globe and that people who were friends

17
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:55,640
or just kind of neutral with each other now are seen as enemies because of the strong divide

18
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,799
between opinions and who's right and who's wrong and

19
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,920
who's from my side and who's if you're not from my side then clearly you're against my

20
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:15,160
side and so it's uh to not take sides is often seen as by one both

21
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:21,599
parties as taking sides for the other side and it can be um difficult to speak

22
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:28,160
up and uh and offer an opinion of you which is not

23
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:37,959
what people would like to hear but then uh maybe gives birth to more

24
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:45,000
divisiveness more anger so I I'll start with a clear kind

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,080
of Buddhist grounding in this kind of topic of violence and quarrels and disputes and then uh say a few things

26
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:01,879
that are directly concerns what's happening in the Middle East and then we'll see what happens

27
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:08,200
then so uh I'll begin with what for me is

28
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:15,879
uh one of the very valued most important top five maybe teachings from the

29
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:23,080
Buddha and maybe I don't want to put those top five in the hierarchy what's one's the highest the most important but

30
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:31,680
this is like for me one some one of the most important teachings that that I inspired by and live my life by

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,599
it concerns who is a wise person a wise person of great

32
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,879
wisdom does not intend for one's own Affliction or for the Affliction of

33
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,159
others or for the Affliction of both self and

34
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,079
others rather a wise person thinks only for one's own

35
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:04,200
welfare the welfare of others the welfare of both and the welfare of the

36
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:11,519
whole world in this way it is in this way that a wise person is of great

37
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:19,560
wisdom so there's wisdom and there's great wisdom and um and uh this week in my

38
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:26,960
morning teaching I I talked about the Buddhist teaching about what's beautiful and what's more

39
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:35,199
beautiful than beautiful and what beautiful is living an ethical life what's more beautiful is

40
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,960
encouraging prompting others to live an ethical life of not killing not

41
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,000
stealing and um and so here's a call that we want to live in a world actively

42
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,280
we want to live in the world responding to it but from a Buddhist point of view

43
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,759
it's not one that is going to set up more divisiveness but but it is one that

44
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:05,120
wants to address the unethical issues of our of our world not be silent but and

45
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:13,000
not not demonize anyone but figure out this very difficult task seemingly

46
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,280
impossible task to promote to help others um

47
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,520
uh live an ethical life which from a Buddhist point of view is how we can

48
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,560
live the best life the greatest good comes from all for

49
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,840
ourselves when we live an ethical life that from the Buddhist point of view is actually

50
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,319
impeccable the standard of the Buddha is very high of how much we're going to

51
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:50,000
live a life that doesn't cause harm whether we think that that's unreasonable and that's the question we

52
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,479
all have to face but this one here that one lives concerned for the welfare of

53
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,759
everyone we ourselves are not excluded sometimes with the teachings of

54
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:11,400
Altru altruism you're supposed to kind of sacrifice yourself for the benefit of others there's no such idea in

55
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,120
Buddhism we're we're as important as anybody else our welfare in fact our

56
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,479
welfare sometimes emphasized in Buddha in Buddhism as a Paramount thing that we

57
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:29,440
should be concerned with because when we're really well then we're in the best position to

58
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:37,080
support other people to be well if we're if we're spiritually ill sick or

59
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:45,160
underdeveloped or something we have so much less to be able to support and help and recognize and encourage for

60
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:53,680
others but it's not limited to self then it's maybe selfish and uh but also be concerned for

61
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,080
the welfare of others and then this wonderful uh concept concern for the

62
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:05,400
welf of both and for me that concern for the welfare of the both has to do with

63
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,720
um uh who we are as a community the US and then for the welfare for the

64
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,599
whole world and it's a a life that thinks thinks it's possible to look for

65
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:24,160
the greatest good for everyone involved and that is not an easy thing to

66
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:34,479
do and uh and one of the places that I've been involved where that was a challenge was uh I was a i chaired an e

67
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,280
Ethics Committee for about 15 years where I had to I was the primary

68
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,400
responder to all kinds of ethical complaints where you know there was a

69
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,800
whole range of things that that was were came but there was usually a conflict

70
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,080
between two people and now there was one that someone the complainer and then there

71
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,199
was a person who they were complaining about the victim and the perpetrator

72
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,280
occasionally we might be appropriate in some people's

73
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:16,960
vocabulary and uh and the approach that I took was how do I how do we find given

74
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:24,800
what happened not denying if something bad happened une ethical happened not denying it not not kind of papering over

75
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,599
it but how do we address all the issues here that need to be addressed

76
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:37,440
and consider what's the greatest good for everybody involved and for people who are the

77
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,000
victim that was a hard thing to hear sometimes and so part of the discussions

78
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,120
was to help the the person who was the victim to understand that this was

79
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,839
possible that that we were concerned about the victim's greatest good really want to take care of that person but

80
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:03,160
there was no need to ignore the well-being of the the person who had the problem in fact taking care of them took

81
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:10,519
care of the whole situation better and um and sometimes for the the

82
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:16,880
person who was complained with against the um uh we had to sometimes

83
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:24,240
convince them that they had to they had to it was very important for them to

84
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,720
live with a uh with that there was consequences they had to live by so they had to be changed they had to go through

85
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,760
some kind of process of something uh and and that sometimes they

86
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,760
protested well this is ridiculous you know I don't need to do this or this is not right but we we convince them that

87
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,200
yes maybe that's true but the whole needs you to do

88
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,760
that and so the greater good comes from this and it's not really very harmful

89
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:01,000
for you it just takes time and um and uh and so then and so

90
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,720
usually what happened um with this process when it went well and somehow

91
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,800
didn't get interrupted in the middle or something um everyone came out

92
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:18,000
happy and uh and even more important was that the wider community that I was

93
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,279
supporting began to trust the Ethics Committee that when the Ethics Committee

94
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,640
called them up and said you know I'm calling from the Ethics Committee

95
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,680
that rather than having their heart sink My Hope was that they would smile

96
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,320
oh great someone has the greater good for

97
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:49,480
me concerned and okay this is not maybe won't be all all easy but like this is going to be a good process to go through

98
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:56,200
conflict doesn't have to be a lost loss for everyone win loss kind of situation

99
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:03,639
it can be a win-win for everyone involved but it takes a lot more time to do

100
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:10,480
that so this this teaching here that the wise person someone considers the good

101
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:17,760
for everyone involved this to me is uh I think speaks to a heart that is not

102
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,160
going to live divisively a heart that's not going to see anyone as enemy but it's going to

103
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:31,000
see everyone with the goodness of our of our the best place in our heart in which we gave upon the

104
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:39,720
world and um and so I'll come back to that and then related to this is

105
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,079
um I don't know if it's a top five teachings of the Buddha but it's up

106
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:51,200
there pretty high for me and it's particularly valuable this time and I think I've read it this last couple of

107
00:11:51,200 --> 00:12:00,399
weeks even hatred never ends through hatred

108
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,400
by non-hate alone does it end this is an ancient

109
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:14,040
[Music] truth sometimes this quote is read hatred never ends through hatred by Love

110
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:24,240
Alone does it end to me that's more inspiring non-h hatred to for me is more

111
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,720
attainable and um and so I'll settle for non-h

112
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,560
hatred the ancient language this word when you have this negative word non

113
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,800
non-h hatred it's it's often said it implies the positive and what's nice

114
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,959
about this is that the positive is a wider range than just love and so maybe love is not exactly

115
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:55,480
what's called for maybe generosity is called for something

116
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,360
else and then and then the same

117
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:12,480
discussion he AB oh this way they abused me attacked me defeated me robbed me for

118
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:20,800
those carrying on like this hatred does not end they abused me attacked me defeated

119
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,760
me robbed me for those not carrying on like this hatred

120
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,600
ends the people who have been abused attacked defeated

121
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,440
robbed can feel like they're Justified to hate in fact hate might seem as a

122
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,160
necessary means by which we're going to defend ourselves care for ourselves have

123
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:54,440
Justice in the world and I don't feel like I want to capable of when someone has been

124
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,759
harmed to want to argue that's not the case

125
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:07,199
that's that's too uncomfortable it feels almost disrespectful or putting salt in a wound which is quite

126
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:13,880
deep and he abused me you know hatred does

127
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,759
not end this way we have by criticizing others by

128
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:26,839
yelling at them and saying you know the idea here is not to say in some simple way I was abused I was attacked but it's

129
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:32,680
the blaming the attacking that this this quote is

130
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,279
criticizing and the final there's a four four verses here and the final one here

131
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:43,680
that's kind of I see as a set maybe it's supposed to get our

132
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:51,120
attention to change how we live Our Lives Many Many do not

133
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,279
realize we here Must

134
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:02,639
Die For Those Who realize this quarrels

135
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:11,199
end so I don't know how that strikes you and uh sometimes uh quarrels have

136
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:19,399
ended when realize that the blood of those who die is more

137
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:25,839
valuable than oil more valuable than a lot of things we're trying to

138
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,720
preserve so the bud addressed the issue of quarrels of disputes and for years I

139
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,040
read these teachings where he addresses it some of them um in

140
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,160
detail as I didn't quite they were kind of flat for me didn't kind of inspire me

141
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:52,759
in some way until recently and uh there's teachings where he uh talks about the conditions the

142
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:58,800
conditions that lead to quarrels and it's a layers of conditions where uh the

143
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:05,600
first layer sets the conditions in place for the next layer kind of a more activated layer and that sets the

144
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,720
conditions for more active activated layer kind of goes like until finally it were so activated we're fighting with

145
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,279
each other and um so the first one the gives

146
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:26,319
a five-part kind of conditions that or four parts that lead to corals and um uh the first first the to

147
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:33,880
those corals and the immediate pre condition for quarrels is a a word which

148
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:40,079
challenges a lot of people when they hear it so if you're challenged you're in good

149
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,519
company cherishing cherishing is a

150
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:51,000
condition now is cherishing a necessary condition for conflict is cherishing

151
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,800
wrong or bad we don't have to see it as wrong or bad but cherishing the the way

152
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:06,798
cherishing is done sometimes leads to all kinds of problems the uh the kind of

153
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:12,319
powerful representative example some of you might know is uh in The Lord of the

154
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,360
Rings Gollum cherishing the

155
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,720
ring his precious I mean if that's what cherishing is we're all in

156
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,160
trouble of course that's not how we all cherish maybe there's innocent harmless

157
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,120
cherishing of things but there's a way of Leaning into what we cherish we want to hold on to it we want to keep it to

158
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:43,160
ourselves we don't want to share it with anyone we want to there's attachment that comes and so when there's

159
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:49,559
attachment with cherishing then we're defensive then we're acquisit we have

160
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:56,720
avaricious all kinds of things happening but before corals There's Something That We're cherishing an

161
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,320
opinion a idea idea a thing a place possession

162
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:11,480
something um before cherishing the precondition for that is having some kind of Desire

163
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,600
here we go these Buddhists always making desire into a

164
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:22,720
problem it isn't that all desires are a problem but there has to be some desire

165
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,440
for us to want to cherish and some desires occasionally

166
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:36,158
some of us will accidentally have a problematic desire none of you of

167
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:43,159
course the precon precondition for desire is pleasantness and

168
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:51,400
unpleasantness to or liking and not liking is another way of translating it to have something we like and not like

169
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,840
um then we have desire for more of it or desire to have it or push it away or not

170
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:04,240
have it and is it wrong to do that no of course not but it's kind of has to be

171
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,720
there first in order for us to want to desire have a desire desire for something we like or desire for something we don't like to go away and

172
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:18,559
then for the Buddha the the of in this particular teaching the fourth the last thing

173
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:25,320
condition the bottom layer the first layer is simple sense contact just simply being in the world

174
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,919
going about your own business and having the wind against your skin seeing the clouds in the sky not today

175
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,799
you know and just tasting your food the most basic sense contact is there any

176
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:45,760
problem with that not necessarily but if you if it produces a

177
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,400
liking that we are attached to and the liking that we're attached to

178
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,559
produces desire for more of what we're attached to that that produces a a

179
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:03,120
cherishing which has attachment built into it and then what happen what's happening is that we're getting

180
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:10,000
increasingly activated there's more we more agitation there's more higher order thinking

181
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
processing wanting motivation operating in the mind all of which is kind of

182
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,120
increasingly stressful even though it might seem Pleasant all along and um and it's as we go along

183
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:30,880
also the focus of attention becomes narrower if you're just sitting quietly in

184
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,240
meditation for example and just allowing all the sense experiences to come and go

185
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,840
and move through you it can be deeply relaxing but as soon as you have

186
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:50,000
something that you like the liking of it the attention is a little bit more kind of now tightened up and focused on the

187
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,559
liking and if you and then if then you if you want more of it the attention

188
00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:00,760
gets more focused around the desire and if you cherish it now you're even

189
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:07,640
more focused and tight around this thing and then if you get into a

190
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:13,960
dispute you know you can some of us are capable of getting into arguments and disputes and conflicts minding our own

191
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,919
business sitting meditating no one has to be around you

192
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:26,440
know and suddenly she said he said they said you know like oh you know how could it be that

193
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:33,760
way and I'm a little bit you know embarrassed to say that I've s sat in meditation and and made up conflict it

194
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,880
didn't exist you know that you know so someone said something they shouldn't have said

195
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,600
it and then I went and checked and they didn't say it and I was you know had just got all worked up right so this

196
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:52,880
this process is process of getting worked up and when I understood this about this list these lists of the

197
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,840
conditional Genesis of conflict then I got excited this is interesting because

198
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,320
if you can go backwards from a most activated State and relax and

199
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:14,080
progressively relax and go through these layers and come to the place where we're no longer activated no longer agitated

200
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,120
no longer contracted with our awareness come back to this place you

201
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,760
know here in this list sense contact that's not to disengage from the

202
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,520
world not to then you know away and just the Simplicity of sense contact but

203
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,600
something much more important can happen and that as once we

204
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:42,039
get maybe I maybe it's okay I hope it's okay to use this word once we get

205
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:48,080
diffused once we become disarmed totally disarmed in the mind from all the

206
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:54,200
conflict all the things that lead up to conflict then we have then it's possible

207
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,360
if we know how to access um a profound

208
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:08,360
place of knowing a profound place of understanding of thinking of contemplation a profound place of deep

209
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,000
feelings that can arise well up from within that are not feelings that are

210
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,480
reactive to what the world is coming at us with when we when we react to things

211
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,600
that's when we have anger and that's when we have hostility and that's when

212
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:32,880
our conceit gets afraid all kinds of things can happen there but there's a

213
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:40,360
the premise in Buddhism is that we have tremendous sources within of wisdom of

214
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,640
Love of care of har Harmony making

215
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,039
instincts to live in cooperation with others in the world not to

216
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:58,320
divide the world and that this comes from a profound place within that is not

217
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:06,120
in the reactive mode so when we go through this these lists of the Genesis of conflict and as a practitioners and

218
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:12,880
we're deactivating ourselves and come to in you like in meditation to a very simple place we're just here in the

219
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,279
present moment with our experience that's the place where we can

220
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:25,200
now ask ourselves from here how do I want to live how do I want to respond to

221
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,679
my friend who uh you know got angry with but I'm not angry now I'm settled the

222
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,080
issue hasn't gone away how do how can I address this so it involves the greater

223
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:45,200
good for both of us I'm hurt I'm afraid maybe my friend

224
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,320
is as well let's not make it worse is there some way we can talk something we

225
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,600
can do maybe we have to talk but before we talk maybe I'll send my friend a

226
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,600
gift and um I'll you know I'll bake some cookies or something and you know just

227
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,200
just do something that Bridges The Divide and then and you know that sometimes we can do

228
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,440
but so um so then we get to the difficult

229
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,960
topic of that I probably is not suited probably not

230
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:27,360
going to address the emotional needs of some of the people involved in this deep

231
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:33,840
deep issue in the Middle East and

232
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:41,320
um but what I've been how I've been orienting myself in reading this studying about

233
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:50,039
this is not to get fixated on Military

234
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,840
strategies and to read up about you know and consider all the kind of

235
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:05,919
military strategies of what needs to happen and why it needs to happen and what is a just war and all these kinds

236
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:13,799
of very painful things that um people are involved in but rather I've been focused on those

237
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:20,039
groups of people who are trying to look for the greatest good for everyone involved the

238
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:26,240
ones who are trying to not create more division but create cooperation create a

239
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:33,159
sense of unification of people who are normally divided and for this some people say

240
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:39,640
that it's very important to consider in the Middle East that

241
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:46,120
Hamas doesn't represent the all the Palestinians that the Israeli government

242
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:52,679
doesn't represent all Israelis all Jewish Israelis without if we make if we don't

243
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:59,760
make that distinction the level of divisiveness the level of blame that gets spread is

244
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,960
really difficult and so there are people who who are not doing this but are

245
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,039
actually coming together cooperatively from both sides and this is what excites

246
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:16,640
me so the one that I kind of got the most excited by is organization called

247
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,360
Sisterhood um it called uh Sisterhood of Shalom

248
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:31,600
Salam those are those the two words for peace in Arabic and in in uh Jew in

249
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,919
Hebrew um and they write in their website as a Sisterhood of Jewish and

250
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:44,519
Muslim women we hold multiple truths at any given moment it is possible for us to

251
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:50,159
acknowledge that murdering civilians is a war crime and firing missiles at

252
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:56,080
civilians is also a war crime it is possible for us to pray for the safe

253
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,120
release of the 150 Israeli captives when this was written and pray for the safety

254
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,360
of the besieged people of Gaza it is possible for us to recognize that

255
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,159
Palestinians are not Hamas and Israeli citizens are not their government it is

256
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:19,000
possible for us to grieve for our own dead and grieve for all those lost in

257
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,399
this horrible cycle of violence and be reminded that violence will always be

258
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,440
met with more violence

259
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,960
at the same time we have to choose compassion which literally means

260
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,840
suffering together and wishing to alleviate suffering we must have compassion for all those who lost their

261
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,760
family members all those those who are in

262
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:54,399
captivity and those seeking shelter from Heavy Artillery equally important it is the

263
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,760
feeling of compassion for each other and for our own tears shock pain and

264
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:07,480
fears we truly are all suffering together at this moment this is what it means to be human

265
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:13,600
this is what it means to possess moral Clarity it's a beautiful statement the

266
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,000
very uh there was a co-founder was a woman named Cheryl

267
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,240
olitzky I think she's a polish jew from what she writes but she in writing about

268
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:31,120
what inspired her to help start this organization that

269
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,159
talmud the the Hebrew Bible the talmood

270
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:44,039
asks or oral law who is a hero the an and

271
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:53,080
answers one who makes one's enemy into a friend isn't that something that's a

272
00:29:53,080 --> 00:30:00,399
hero the rabbis communicated that it's possible to change people's attitudes and that it is desirable to

273
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:07,600
strive to do so then Cheryl wrote I knew I had to change

274
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,640
attitudes so this is what also Buddhism is doing so this Buddhist attitude that I'm trying to or teaching I'm trying to

275
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,559
offer here at IMC is not isolated to BU Buddhism this what what she's calling

276
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:26,600
from talmud is very similar and um one

277
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,600
who makes one's enemies into a friend what a great

278
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:38,080
thing and um the mission of this organization is

279
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,880
based on our shared values the mission of The Sisterhood of Salam Shalom is to

280
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,120
build relationships between Muslim and Jewish women of all ages to promote and

281
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,159
advocate for human rights and to end acts of hate for all human beings we

282
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,240
envision a world a world where Muslims and Jewish people live without hate and

283
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,720
where Freedom equality and social justice are within reach for all of

284
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,639
us there's two more organizations that I want to read about and another is a

285
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:16,120
organization in Israel called standing together is a Grassroots movement

286
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,200
mobilizing Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel in Pursuit Of Peace

287
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,399
equality and social and climate Justice while the minority who Ben this

288
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:34,519
is important while the minority who benefit from the status quo of occupation and economic inequality seek

289
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:41,240
to keep us divided we know that we the majority have far more in

290
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,679
common than that which sets us apart when we stand together we are strong

291
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:53,360
enough to fundamentally alter the existing sociopolitical reality the future that we want peace

292
00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:00,159
and Independence for Israelis and Palestinians full equality for for all citizens and true social economic and

293
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,880
environmental justice is possible because where there is struggle

294
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,000
there is hope so I love that recognition that this takes work this is not an easy

295
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,519
thing to do and um but one of the things I I view I point of view point point out is

296
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:26,320
that as difficult as creating peace this way is I it's probably a lot cheaper than

297
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,559
all the money spent on arms does it take more time I think it

298
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:40,559
takes a lot more time than any given War much more

299
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:47,480
difficult but then it creates the conditions for a lasting peace War creates the condition for more

300
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:53,159
war and that takes a lot of time sometimes I've seen just in human

301
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:58,760
interactions over and over again that if we don't take time to sit down to work

302
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:05,200
out our differences our conflicts or all that that uh um it it festers and lasts

303
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,600
a long time but it's so inefficient people people are

304
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:16,519
inefficient and you know to sit down and talk and work it out and work out our differences it's such an inefficient

305
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:23,799
process I mean who has time for that we have a long to-do list but I've seen over and over again

306
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:32,639
that unless you take that time there's so much more processing that happens later and on and on and on so it turns

307
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:38,039
out to being inefficient sometimes is it the most efficient so the

308
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:44,440
struggle the last one I want to read is a interesting group in Israel called

309
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:51,559
combatants for peace founded in 2006 it is a nonprofit

310
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:58,799
volunteer organization of EX combatant israels and Palestinians men and women who have laid

311
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,639
down their weapons and rejected all means of violence we are working together to end

312
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:12,358
the occupation of Palestine bring Justice to the land and demonstrate that Israelis and Palestinians can work and

313
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:19,118
live together we are a group of Palestinians and Israelis who have taken an active

314
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:26,440
part in the cycle of violence in our region Israeli soldiers serving in the

315
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:32,158
Israeli Defense Force and Palestinians as combatants fighting to free their

316
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:38,679
country Palestine from the Israeli occupation we serving our people raised

317
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:45,480
weapons which we aimed at each other and saw each other only through gun s

318
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,440
sites we have established combatants for peace on the basis of

319
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,839
nonviolence nonviolence principles isn't that remarkable

320
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:05,560
at uh Mahatma Gandhi was uh uh most enthusiastic about former soldiers who

321
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:13,599
be joined his non-violent uh e efforts in India because he said being

322
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,000
nonviolent it takes a lot of strength a lot of Courage yet and the soldiers have

323
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,680
it sometimes and so I'm impressed by these so these are three organizations there's

324
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,800
other organizations who doing this kind of work I think for the most part these

325
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:37,320
kinds of efforts don't make the front page but I think they should I think

326
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:43,920
this should be championed and supported and and um and brought

327
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,599
forth so to be concerned for the greater good of everybody

328
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:57,800
involved to be able to find a way to process our own fear or own trauma our

329
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,240
own hurt our own anger in healthy appropriate ways to really bring out the

330
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:10,440
best in each of us and then to be able to be in a place to want to be in a place where we live

331
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:16,359
this life uh where we trying not to cause

332
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:23,319
harm to live non-violently trying to promote the welfare and happiness the well-being of

333
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:30,200
everyone that's the kind of world I'd like to live in and is it naive to do

334
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:37,369
so I don't [Laughter]

335
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,760
care if uh this is the way this is the way I want to live this is the world I

336
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:53,079
want to live in and I don't want to contribute to the opposite I want to contribute to this and uh

337
00:36:53,079 --> 00:37:01,839
and I don't see for me there's any other choice so that was my effort to say a few

338
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,960
things and I both am a little bit reluctant but also feel maybe it's wise

339
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,760
to see if there's any comments or questions anybody has yes

340
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,920
please can you wait for the mic because otherwise I won't hear hold it like a rockar hold it like a rockstar okay then

341
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:28,000
um no I just was wondering if you could repeat the name of that second group so I could remember it oh yes the

342
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,480
the

343
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:40,359
um standing together thank you standing together there's an organization called Stand

344
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:46,760
Together that's in United States and then standing together is in

345
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,720
Israel yes yeah it happened to be yesterday I heard a mediator say something along these lines that you

346
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:01,599
reminded me of that uh when responding to someone who's angry she said um it

347
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:07,760
sounds like you really care about something yeah I want to know what you care about yeah for that's wonderful

348
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,960
yeah and then you kind of drop below and eventually maybe you find some really great values that you share with

349
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,480
them but the application of it maybe has gone

350
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,920
differently so thank you for listening thank you for being here I hope this was

351
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,680
close enough I mean I talking to a Buddhist audience or not Buddhist audience but an audience who came to a

352
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:40,000
Buddhist center to hear a Buddhist teacher so I feel like I have some permission to to do something unpopular

353
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,119
if that's the case so um so there is a potluck today everyone's welcome to stay

354
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:51,280
whether you're Brad Sumer think or not it's a wonderful way of being a community if you're willing to take a

355
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,040
couple of minut five minutes before the official ending if you would be willing to turn to you don't you can don't have

356
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:03,400
to if you don't want to but if you turn to um maybe a couple of people next to you so that everyone kind of look around

357
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:09,200
and see who's there around you so that no one's left alone and say hello and any thoughts about this talk or

358
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,160
something
