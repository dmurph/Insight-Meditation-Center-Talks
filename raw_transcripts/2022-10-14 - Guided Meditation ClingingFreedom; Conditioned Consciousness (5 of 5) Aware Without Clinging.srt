1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:10,440
mm-hmm so good day on this Friday

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:18,800
and uh delighted to be here with all of you

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,240
so one of the themes for this week has been the way that uh

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,180
certain states can exist together sometimes in a spectrum where the degree

5
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,600
to which one or the other is depends where we are in the Spectrum and sometimes maybe we don't necessarily

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,600
see as a spectrum we see it as being quite this distinct but that they

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,360
things can coexist and happily one of the things that can co-exist

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,260
is we can cling that we can be attached we can be holding on we can be

9
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:06,060
um heavily resisting something or and at the same time

10
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,439
be aware of that who in a way that is free that is not clinging

11
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,840
it's possible to have very clear sense of knowing

12
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,380
or of an open kind of awareness within which

13
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:30,659
we know there is clinging but the knowing is free

14
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,420
The Knowing feels a light it has like no weight

15
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,900
The Knowing feels maybe kind of I don't know if allowing is the right

16
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:49,920
way or accepting is allowing is the right word or accepting is the right word but the knowing is equanimous the

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,079
knowing is not a hostage or not caught in

18
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,600
what is known and so this uh ability to do both is

19
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,640
actually very significant for doing this practice because some of us will have a very

20
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:13,020
strong tendency to identify to lock into different states and especially if

21
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,520
there's a things were critical about ourselves or strong very impulses which are

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,920
of attachment we could kind of so get so preoccupied with so caught in it

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,640
that um that it's almost like we become it or it's inconceivable being without it or

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,959
it feels like we have to struggle with it or fight it or with it but when we have a clear sense

25
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:46,099
of this knowing this awareness this way of recognizing

26
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:53,459
that is not caught is not entangled with it just simply

27
00:02:53,459 --> 00:03:00,060
knows the Simplicity of it without identifying with it without seeing making it a

28
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,580
problem without making the knowing of it a problem maybe some things need to be

29
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:12,060
addressed in their issues but the knowing is independent of the problem it just knows

30
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,519
and that's a phenomenally useful reference point for finding our way

31
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:25,260
because then we're not um beholden to the attachment to the clinging we're

32
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:33,599
not under its influence which paradoxically we are if we're fighting it or criticizing it or upset about it

33
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,900
and so the fact that we can hold to both be attached and know it in an unattached

34
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:48,500
way so that'll be kind of the orientation for this this meditation

35
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,900
and so to assume your meditation posture

36
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:02,780
and gently close your eyes and straight off here

37
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:10,340
what is the most obvious thing that you're aware of for yourself right now

38
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:36,840
and whatever is obvious right now for you see if you can experiment

39
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:44,040
with recognizing that's how it is in a relaxed recognition

40
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,560
as if you're sitting back and gazing upon it

41
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,400
even if you are upset with it or have reactions to it perhaps that's which knows

42
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,280
doesn't have to just know it

43
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,759
some people the idea of gazing upon it can provide a little bit healthy

44
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:16,639
distance where the mind's eye is not the continent your Seas what's there

45
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:31,500
so then to maybe with a reference point with a

46
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,039
sense of just knowings unentangled awareness

47
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,979
become aware of your body and let there be a few long slow deep

48
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,400
breaths

49
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,620
if any of you have ever gone scuba diving

50
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:06,539
were you aware of the vastness of the water around you very attentive to it

51
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:12,979
and also it's so precious each breath

52
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:21,720
and so here it's so wonderful the vast this of

53
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:28,340
awareness of consciousness of knowing

54
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:37,039
and within it the preciousness of breathing breathing deeply and relaxing

55
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,160
letting your breathing return to normal

56
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:18,000
and maybe with relaxing on every exhale see if there can be the breathing the

57
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,720
relaxation while the same time knowing it

58
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:33,780
with ease knowing it lightly openly not needing it to be anything or

59
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:39,139
not a source of judgment just knowing

60
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:43,680
breathing simply resting

61
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:52,160
in the knowing that allows things to be as they are

62
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:59,040
The Knowing that's not confined

63
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,920
by what is known and to practice that

64
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,680
first and foremost with the breathing staying

65
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:17,339
connected to the breathing with a lightness like a feather touch

66
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:24,240
with maintaining that feather touch breath after breath after breath lightly

67
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,000
staying in the unencumbered knowing

68
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,100
foreign

69
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:09,920
remember to come back to knowing being aware

70
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,440
but as you come back to it enter into it

71
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,920
appreciate whatever degree of Freedom you find in knowing

72
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,380
knowing is free from what is known

73
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,420
no clinging

74
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,600
and hopefully you feel delightful attraction

75
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:52,220
to this present moment capacity to know

76
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,680
without being entangled

77
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:08,220
and it's not so important to what you know so let yourself know whatever is

78
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:14,820
happening in the present but take refuge in The Knowing that's

79
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,779
unentangled

80
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,620
there's a strong tendency to identify with what we cling to

81
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,600
what we're preoccupied with

82
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:12,679
and so when we know it that knowing can be influenced by that clinging

83
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:22,220
to relax and almost maybe know from the back of the skull

84
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:28,160
to know somewhat

85
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,480
removed from where the clinging is

86
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,480
into no peacefully lightly

87
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,039
the clinging itself

88
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:31,820
perhaps you can know with more freedom

89
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:37,820
if you have a small smile on your face

90
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:44,299
it's just a teeny turning up of the corners of the mouth

91
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:51,559
and maybe that brightens the awareness enough

92
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:59,419
for a stronger sense of unconstricted knowing

93
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:09,419
foreign

94
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,640
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

95
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:39,480
to again maybe make a smile on your face

96
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,840
because a smile on the face can make it harder

97
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,720
to be grim to be harder to be attached

98
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:59,120
the harder to resist

99
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:06,419
and to not resist your capacity

100
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:12,299
to gaze upon the world kindly

101
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:19,500
take gaze upon the world in a friendly way

102
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:25,700
what would it be like if you were a friend to all that lives

103
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:37,919
maybe even there's hope that with warm and kind enough friendliness

104
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:44,059
you'll befriend even the enemies even the people used

105
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:52,860
have animosity towards to have a smile on your face

106
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:58,740
to disarm your hostility animosity

107
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:04,260
and to take the risk to gaze upon all that lives

108
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,460
in a friendly way

109
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,100
and may it be that these

110
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:48,720
360 people now of you all sitting here

111
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,740
may it be that that becomes a Force a force

112
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,960
of kindness her friendliness that we carry out into

113
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,059
the world today May whatever benefit in merits we have

114
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:12,140
from this meditation together spread from each of us in all directions

115
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:19,740
out into the world so we contribute to the welfare and happiness of others

116
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,740
may it be our wish that this meditation

117
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:31,679
is for the happiness the safety the peace and the freedom

118
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:39,059
of those upon whom we gaze upon today may we gaze upon them

119
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,260
in a friendly way

120
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:56,869
thank you [Music]

121
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:14,760
so then we come to the last talk on the topic of conditioned

122
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:22,260
consciousness and our connection to being aware to being

123
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,659
conscious is quite variable and sometimes we have no connection at

124
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:33,480
all we could be so caught up in something so preoccupied so besides ourselves that

125
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,580
we're besides our suffering we lose ourselves in what we're doing we are we

126
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:44,399
can end up saying I didn't I don't know what I was thinking or what I was doing I didn't even know what I was saying

127
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:51,960
when I said it um we can be so wrapped up in something that the very idea that we can be aware

128
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:58,320
and conscious is far from the Mind far from what we're preoccupied with

129
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:05,460
and it's possible to be in states where um it's just like so obvious that we're

130
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:12,120
conscious it's like this like the main game in town is being aware and conscious maybe in a relaxing wonderful

131
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:19,200
day off laying under a tree in the park and looking up at the clouds and the sky and

132
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,500
and there's not much to see but it's uh there's a clear sense of wow

133
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:32,940
I'm aware I'm present I'm conscious I'm alive this is quite something and uh and

134
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:39,419
the sense of Consciousness there is really strong and then from that place of being in a

135
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:46,380
day off on the park looking at the sky so we might something might happen in

136
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:51,559
the park that um we feel we feel we lose some of that

137
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:57,779
openness that lightness that kind of awe because we get caught in something maybe

138
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:02,940
the ice cream truck goes by and that's enough to kind of oh that's like brings

139
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:09,539
up all kinds of memories from childhood and and you get absorbed in that then the fact there are clouds and Sky

140
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:17,279
disappears the fact that you're kind of have capacity for Consciousness disappears over the idea the memories or

141
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:25,580
the idea of wanting ice cream or someone gets up in a soapbox not too far away in the park and starts

142
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:33,360
pontificating loudly about political views that are abhorrent to you and you feel the

143
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:40,020
contraction of the heart contraction of the mind and and irritation and and with

144
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:45,480
that if you try to notice what's happened through that Consciousness you notice the conscious self might feel

145
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,360
contracted or tight or or there might even be a resistance in the mind to even

146
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:59,340
notice that that you're aware in Consciousness because the strong pull into the world of irritation or anger or

147
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:05,399
fear whatever it might be connected to that so that our connection to Consciousness

148
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:11,760
our connection to being aware is quite variable and but I think that's having said

149
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:18,480
saying it that way is a little bit off or very bites off it implies that Consciousness is something

150
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,899
stationary static thing that we can a variable how we touch it or know it

151
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:31,200
but rather what Consciousness is is it it is shaped

152
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:38,760
by the state of the Mind so the in the in the park looking at the sky Consciousness that what we feel is

153
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,399
consciousness or awareness has been expanded has been created has been

154
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:51,059
imagined constructed to be Broad when we get preoccupied and tight

155
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:57,240
then that sense of awareness what awareness is has become tight and constructed there's not an awareness

156
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:04,200
that somehow exists offline or outside that's Broad and spacious the conscience

157
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:11,700
has become that way and this is a theory but it has just as valid as a theory

158
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:18,419
that there is this thing called Consciousness which is always Broad and we lose touch with it

159
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:24,358
and my suggestion is that we're still in touch with it but maybe but we're in

160
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:30,960
touch with something now that a conscious conscience of thus become contracted and tight and narrow

161
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,720
so in this way is continuing this idea that our sense our idea of what

162
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,720
Consciousness is what awareness is is variable and is influenced by all

163
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:50,158
kinds of things it's influenced by the degree of agitation but the degree of

164
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:58,260
of uh peace or calm that we have it's uh it's

165
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:04,560
uh influenced by how much clinging we have and how much Freedom we have

166
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,599
and so we contribute to that creation of

167
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:15,839
consciousness by the state of our mind and if this particular states of Mind

168
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:21,960
are valuable and useful then we want to kind of create the conditions for that to be there

169
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:29,099
in an open expansive free consciousness is invaluable

170
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:35,579
because it's a protection from clinging to protection from greed hate and

171
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:42,420
delusion it's a protection from Fear oftentimes it's a space within which some of the

172
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:48,420
best qualities of who we are have a chance to surface love can come for example

173
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:54,660
the rather than anger or blame and it's almost like the more

174
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,940
Consciousness is made to be Broad and open and receptive

175
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:07,200
the more space there is for some of the deeper beautiful workings of our hearts of our minds

176
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,740
so to begin appreciating our contribution to the how we

177
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:19,339
experience Consciousness how we experience awareness and to

178
00:36:19,339 --> 00:36:25,380
use that awareness that's more light more open more non-reactive

179
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:30,480
to be aware of how we cling how we tight how we

180
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,560
resist and that's a fascinating way to an alternative to get collapsing into

181
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:44,640
our clinging getting sucked into it rather to know it so we can be clinging

182
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:52,500
and we can know it and the image I like to have is someone you know a tight fist that doesn't want to release itself and

183
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,079
a hand comes from underneath it and just holds it gently just gives it support

184
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:06,839
takes its weight and as it's as the fist feels the support then it begins to relax

185
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:13,020
so this this awareness that can no attachment can no clinging

186
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:19,980
uh it's it's kind of like there to offer support there to hold it there to be its

187
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:25,560
friend to accompany it so that the clinging is not condemned is not fought

188
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:32,339
with it's not denied not trying to pushed away but so the clinging has a

189
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:38,099
chance to uncleing so that the way that we're entangled can

190
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:44,160
be unentangled can disentangle itself and this way in which this

191
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,980
broader more equanimous knowing

192
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:55,320
that's independent of what is known that's not entangled with what's known

193
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,540
can meet then the clinging is one of the great powers of this

194
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:08,040
Buddhist practice it meets it and if you're patient you'll you can

195
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:13,619
discover that you don't have to do the uncleinging you don't have to do the

196
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:21,680
letting go listen to No to know with non-clinging

197
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:27,240
allows what's what's climate tooth allows the clinging the attachments we

198
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:36,140
have to slowly thaw to slowly unwind to slowly release

199
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:43,980
and so in this way in this lesson it excuse me

200
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:51,420
becomes more and more important the further we go in Dharma practice

201
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:57,839
that as as we get more and more concentrated more still more mindful the

202
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:05,940
mindfulness and meditation gets stronger the more and more important it becomes not to be the one who lets go not to be

203
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:12,599
the one who uncleings but rather to just allow the knowing

204
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:19,859
to be the the tenderizer the the dissolving agent just

205
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:26,280
no just know without any reactivity so that's becomes more important because

206
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:32,880
we keep practicing early in practice like the beginning of a sitting please by all means relax

207
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:40,079
relax your body let go of what is easy to let go of but then over time hopefully you'll

208
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,920
discover how wonderful how smile producing

209
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:54,180
it is to know without attachment to know

210
00:39:54,180 --> 00:40:02,280
without being caught into or glued to what is being known

211
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:10,700
what is being known is allowed to be as it is and you can settle back and know

212
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:16,560
in a way that knowing maybe we'll be smile producing for you

213
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:24,000
how lucky we are to be able to know this way how delightful to know this way

214
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
how wonderful to know in a way that can bring forth all kinds of gifts

215
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,220
for the world and may it be

216
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:41,720
um may it be that you will

217
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:47,700
discover something about a liberated awareness

218
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:53,040
that allows you to be a gift a full of your full giftness

219
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,440
