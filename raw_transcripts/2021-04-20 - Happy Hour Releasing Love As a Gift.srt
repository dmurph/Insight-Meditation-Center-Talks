may you have ease dearly

182
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,359
and for the last minutes of this practice period

183
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,160
connecting connecting with this movement of the heart

184
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:07,839
she's releasing giving away giving a gift a blessing is generosity

185
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,200
every release the other side of the coin is an act of generosity

186
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:22,800
giving connecting with this movement of the heart and giving

187
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:31,200
goodness good will friendliness giving it away

188
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,640
and noticing if your heart feels any brighter or happier

189
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,760
for having given it away having released it

190
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,920
to know it's also the same movement of the heart when we release thoughts judgments

191
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,440
preoccupations

192
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:10,559
emotions when they're ready same letting go

193
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:21,040
and now letting go releasing into appreciation whatever this practice

194
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,839
period was like

195
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:33,920
if the mind was sleepy distracted it's okay you did your best

196
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,560
you showed up as best as you were able to do to show up in this moment

197
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,400
appreciating that you showed up

198
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:53,440
did your best cultivating seeds of goodness and kindness

199
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:04,560
for yourself and all beings everywhere

200
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:19,839
may all beings be free all beings be happy including ourselves

201
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:38,480
thank you everyone thank you for your practice so

202
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:47,838
so what i wanted to bring attention to is how

203
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,839
this act of releasing this movement of releasing or giving giving

204
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,960
this movement of giving giving blessings giving goodness

205
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,119
sharing meta sharing good wishes

206
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:12,800
that also is is the same as the release when we

207
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:18,560
release when we let go as i mentioned the thought of preoccupation

208
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,960
and there is this beautiful word chaga that i mentioned on the retreat which is

209
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:32,480
both means release relinquishment giving away and also it means generosity

210
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,440
and with generosity we have this association of brightness there is a sense of gladness

211
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:45,440
generosity ah what a bright beautiful sense it's the same movement of the heart

212
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,680
releasing giving away and the heart gladdens it feels fuller it feels happy

213
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,040
and chaga generosity is a precondition for happiness

214
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:04,240
in buddhist teachings a heart that is generous that doesn't cling to

215
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:11,119
you name it doesn't cling to bitterness doesn't cling to preoccupation doesn't cling

216
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,279
to stuff it's it's a generous heart it's a happy heart

217
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:25,359
and one more thing to say is there's plenty of research about how our

218
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:31,920
cognition is embodied embodied cognition embodied cognition so these words that

219
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:39,359
we use release really there were based on actions activities so if you're wondering well

220
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,280
how do i let go how do i let go if that's a question that comes over you then practice

221
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:52,640
giving things away practice that physical tangible giving away to give gifts

222
00:40:52,640 --> 00:41:00,000
give smiles give give things away that's our same it's the same it's the same action

223
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,880
either physically or emotionally mentally so so

224
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,800
plenty to work with and practice with so we have some time

225
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,839
for reflections or questions what you might have noticed that came up for you

226
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:23,520
you can raise your zoom hand or you can type them in chat and if you type them

227
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,359
to me alone i will not say your names will be private if you type them to everyone

228
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:35,839
then i'll say your name you'll be public so reflections

229
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,680
eric please

230
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,079
thanks nikki i guess the difference for me that made it hard to connect the

231
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:55,839
two was that giving somebody a gift of peace or happiness seemed nice and

232
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:03,870
giving away all my ruminations didn't seem like anyone would want those or something bad to give away so yeah

233
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:10,560
[Music] yeah yeah i appreciate you bringing that up eric and that's something that comes

234
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,319
up a lot so so the invitation as i brought it during the guided meditation

235
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:22,160
is is imagine that you're releasing them first of all releasing

236
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,280
them into goodness because whenever something is released if there's a sense of freedom you know when you're

237
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,760
freeing their ruminations there's a goodness that's being generated and yet with the question that you're asking well nobody would want the

238
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:41,440
the bastard of the pain the sorrow the roommates imagine you're putting them on the lap of the buddha or kuan yin

239
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:47,119
embodiment of compassion or whatever figure that represents compassion for you and they're strong enough their

240
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,160
heart is so big they'll hold it with you they'll hold it for you here the sorrow

241
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:58,560
hold it with me please will you i'll put it on your lap i'll release it sort of like my it's like ah it's not

242
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:05,520
personal let's it's more universal it's a part of the human condition so that's the invitation i have for you

243
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:13,839
to consider how does that sound derek

244
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,800
i'll try it thank you great thank you eric

245
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:27,838
other questions or reflections that came up for you why did you notice

246
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,880
did any of you notice your heart was happier more glad there was more lightness

247
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:50,078
from actually this act of offering this generosity of giving someone else in your mind goodness

248
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:56,800
yes i see nicolas says yay has a celebratory nicholas do you want

249
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:05,359
to say more oh um yeah just uh

250
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:12,160
feeling into the presence of the person is very supportive and um yeah i was i was

251
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:17,599
playing with there was tension in my shoulders and neck and there was

252
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:24,240
warmth towards the person and kind of feeling the the interplay between those and i mean there's warmth as there's release

253
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:30,240
it was fun to build that physically a little bit that was really great nice so so the sense of just the warmth

254
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:36,880
and the heart and releasing some tension in the back and the interplay of of of this release and that release is

255
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:44,240
is that what you were saying did i hear that right and i muted on accident yes exactly so

256
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:50,000
there's kind of a sense of bringing some attention to the tension and then naturally it settles out a bit

257
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,040
and then there's a little bit more space to feel good will there's the into that space there's a little bit more room

258
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:03,119
towards the person yeah oh sweet so what i'm hearing is kind of being have being with the goodwill and

259
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:09,119
then bringing attention to this tightness it's like oh it released a little bit there was a little more space and then there was more space for the

260
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:15,280
goodwill and then there was more goodwill and then there was more space for the tension to release so it was a virtuous cycle it's a

261
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:22,800
virtuous cycle ah lovely beautiful observation yes that's how it works yes the virtual

262
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:29,040
cycle that's lovely yeah that's the yeah and it and it's it's the same release i'm so glad you

263
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:35,839
you brought this up because it's the same gift it's the same release it's kind of like the same it's like way the tightness oh yeah just

264
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:42,319
a little bit of release oh here there's a gifting so thank you for reporting that because

265
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:48,720
it's the same movement of the heart one more reflection is that uh yeah just like it also helps because i'm more okay

266
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:55,839
with not forcing release of tension but there's a sense of forcing goodwill so it kind of informed both ways because

267
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,440
it was like oh i don't force or release the tension that lets go and in the same way oh i didn't have to kind of press the gas pedal

268
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:08,000
it filled the space that it was given brilliant oh i i love that that they

269
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,599
both informed each other yeah but the gentleness of the release of this like

270
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:21,200
oh yeah this could just be gentle to just be an offering it's kind of like opening the same way that you kind of invite the

271
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:28,000
um you know the tension ah do you like to release oh yes it's it's safe it's kind it's nice it wants

272
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,680
to release it in the same way would you like to offer kindness and goodwill in this moment oh yes i feel

273
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:40,839
i like this person i do want to offer goodwill yeah great thank you so much nicholas

274
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:46,160
lovely and jerry says it was helpful to start the focus

275
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:51,200
on the abdomen than the mind yes well i would say that

276
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:57,119
maybe i would shift that because and say focus on the abdomen instead of

277
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:04,560
the head because where is your mind embodied mind your mind might be your mind is in your abdomen jerry

278
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:11,040
so you are focusing on your mind it's just that it's in the abdomen

279
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:17,839
love that love that so dear all let's uh so eva hold that for

280

289
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:24,800

295
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:06,559

296
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:14,240
it's still relevant if you would raise your hand again so i can see you and ask you to unmute please there you

298
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:26,559
um i shared what i was about to share in

299
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:33,200
my small group basically what i shared was that uh this

300
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:41,359
is my second time coming to the happy hour and uh the very first time i joined

301
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:47,680
the group in the small group uh you've asked us to start with 30 seconds

302
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:53,040
of sending meta to each other and that feels very awkward

303
00:49:53,040 --> 00:50:00,160
and i feel very awkward and that was the first time that i was asked to do that but then

304
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:07,520
uh today this is second time and then uh after practicing the

305
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:14,000
you know uh releasing the stress and then you know uh actually sending

306
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,079
the good wishes to uh everyone and i all of a sudden

307
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:28,319
remembered you know that instruction you gave us the first time my first time and

308
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:34,640
i actually was conscious about each one of these

309
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:41,599
you know we are on the zoom squares but um actually these old people right now

310
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:48,880
sending the good wishes to me and i'm receiving on the end and when i'm

311
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:56,480
practicing alone the world seems really tight and small and especially colbert we're not seeing

312
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:03,599
each other and alone but then all of a sudden it's expanded and then wow

313
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:09,760
we are doing this together and everyone's actually sending me the

314
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,800
mentor right now and that really you know my world

315
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:21,680
expanded and felt connected and uh that's what i shared in a small group

316
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:27,520
