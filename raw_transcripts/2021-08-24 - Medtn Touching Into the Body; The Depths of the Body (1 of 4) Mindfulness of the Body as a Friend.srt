1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,680
so please gather yourself and prepare for

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,120
our meditation together

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,920
perhaps taking a long slow deep breath

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,400
and on the exhale allowing the body to soften

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,720
closing the eyes if that's comfortable for you

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,440
and just settling in [Music] to the sense of the body sitting

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,960
or if you're lying down in the sense of the body lying

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,920
maybe feeling how intimate it is to be in touch with the

9
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,520
body from the inside we do it all day in a sense i don't

10
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,000
always appreciate the sort of

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,159
close warm feeling of that

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,600
so connecting in with the body

13
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,960
perhaps softening [Music] the eyes and the eye sockets

14
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,920
the face all the little muscles on the scalp

15
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,078
softening down through the neck and the shoulders

16
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,360
letting the shoulders drop down naturally

17
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,400
down into the chest area sensing the three-dimensionality of the

18
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,080
rib cage front back sides

19
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,959
down into the belly

20
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,920
sensing how when we bring our attention into certain areas of the body

21
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,160
there's a way in which they come alive

22
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:03,040
somehow they were waiting for the illumination of awareness to

23
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:11,680
vibrate to offer some feeling to us

24
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:21,360
down into the hips the legs

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,239
even feeling into the knee and ankle joints

26
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,920
and including the hands and the feet

27
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,319
so the body sitting

28
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,040
sometimes as the stillness of the body settles in

29
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,040
then the motions of breathing become the most prominent thing we can

30
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:22,880
feel sensing the breathing body

31
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,440
the air coming in going out it's very simple

32
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,479
natural and yet we don't always bring attention

33
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,720
in an intimate detailed way

34
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,420
allowing the gentle sensations of the breath to calm

35
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:07,400
[Music] the feelings in the body

36
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,800
when we treat the body with this kind of gentleness and open attention

37
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,479
there's a response inside if we treat the body as a friend it may

38
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,919
begin to feel like our friend

39
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,479
sense it's what's closest to us

40
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,840
so finding some rest in the home of the body

41
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:35,840
even if there's discomfort or tiredness or stiffness

42
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,479
there can still be a sense that the mindfulness of that

43
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,000
is helpful supportive

44
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,120
there's a way in which the body is also

45
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,319
one of the ways that we can connect to the mind

46
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:05,039
so much information in the body related to the mind

47
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,880
you may sense that you have some emotions present

48
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,440
[Music] some mood that's coloring your

49
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:25,680
experience right now [Music] feeling into how that is

50
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,120
manifesting in the body

51
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:41,839
sometimes we feel heat in certain areas

52
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,440
associated with our mental state

53
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,480
we feel tightness sometimes

54
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,680
fear will cause us to raise the shoulders up in tension

55
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:11,600
or anger can be felt as heat and tightness in the stomach area

56
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,880
many emotions are in the throat area

57
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:32,000
could we get curious about the way in which our body's current

58
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,839
manifestation the current feelings we have in the body are related to our mind state

59
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,720
our emotions

60
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,480
having that curiosity about the body

61
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,120
is a way of not being so entangled in those particular emotions but instead

62
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:05,839
learning about them being with them in a kind helpful way

63
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:51,640
perhaps allowing the in and out breathing to pass through any areas of tension

64
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,480
just resting with this dynamic experience of the body

65
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,959
um

66
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:50,058
[Music]

67
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,920
and when the mind gets caught up in thinking

68
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,959
analyzing remembering planning

69
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,320
we can just gently reopen awareness to the experience of the body

70
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,160
body is always in the present moment

71
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,600
and it might be interesting in today's exploration of mindfulness of

72
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,320
the body to notice

73
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:58,320
if when you've been thinking there was any impact on the body

74
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:06,399
in the same way that emotions can bring tension and heat and

75
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,519
other changes to the body so too

76
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:18,800
thinking has effects effects

77
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,360
it's interesting to learn for ourselves what those are

78
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:33,680
do certain tensions appear certain changes in sensations when we've

79
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,680
had a bout of thinking

80
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,320
so in this type of exploration it's it's okay to get caught up in thought

81
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:04,040
because you're learning afterwards what impact that had

82
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,679
hmm

83
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,450
[Music]

84
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,919
you

85
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,640
and as mindfulness of the body deepens further

86
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:57,200
perhaps as the mind gets a bit calmer we may be able to feel

87
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:04,440
the sensations associated with thinking as it is occurring

88
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,559
is there a particular place from which thinking seems to originate

89
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,279
your body

90
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,840
often it's in the head

91
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,000
is there a change in the sense of the rest of the body

92
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,219
while there is a thought going on [Music]

93
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,440
is there a change in how mindfulness feels when it is

94
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:01,159
knowing a thought or knowing the body when there isn't a thought present

95
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,840
and as we stay with mindfulness of the body

96
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:09,919
we may begin to sense that the body also has

97
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,840
deep sensations of peace available to it

98
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:22,480
the peace and ease that we've cultivated in our mind

99
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,240
can be felt through the body

100
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,158
perhaps as a deep stability

101
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:44,158
or as a beautiful space within the body

102
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:53,200
it's something that feels very true and reliable and

103
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,200
beautiful

104
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,679
perhaps a refuge

105
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,880
so we may come to value the body

106
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,840
mindfulness of the body as our friend in a way

107
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,360
something we might bring with us throughout the day

108
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:41,278
helping us to stay balanced and open with the people we encounter

109
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,039
perhaps remembering also that they too have bodies

110
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,720
they too work with this physical part of being

111
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,120
it's one thing that connects us with others

112
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,799
and if we have made our body our home somewhere safe

113
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:13,039
something that gives us useful information something that supports us

114
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:19,158
and there's a way in which we also are supporting others

115
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,158
when we bring our full bodily presence into our life

116
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:39,039
we help others to stay connected and stay present in some way

117
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,320
we can't always see it

118
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,759
but it's a very worthy effort

119
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,960
so perhaps as you go about your day or evening

120
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:06,240
you can consider how the body might come along with you as a

121
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,640
friend

122
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,440
supporting you to be present be of service

123
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,559
be more kind loving compassionate

124
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:37,080
generous all of which bring beautiful feelings in the body as well as the mind

125
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,760
only all beings learn to be at ease

126
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,240
in their bodies

127
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,559
so for those of you who may have joined a little bit later

128
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:42,960
you can see that gill is not here and i just want to pass along that he is

129
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,760
fine he was planning to be here but then he had to travel unexpectedly

130
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,679
so as i said everything is fine my name is kim allen and i'll be here for the rest

131
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:05,279
of this week i know that gil was planning to speak this whole week on the topic of patience

132
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:12,240
so uh this monday's topic of staying true under stress is perhaps relevant this

133
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,000
week it's um always a bit stressful to have a rapid change in circumstances or

134
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,120
a change of plans so that's something that we can all practice embodying

135
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,480
us along with gil for this week and then i also thought that

136
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:35,200
it might be more meaningful for you to explore the topic of patience if you have to wait until next week to

137
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:42,720
do it so we'll have a different theme for the next four days

138
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,559
i'll be talking about different ways of using the body

139
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,640
as one's field of practice and um i'm calling this series the depth

140
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:01,360
of the body because we may not realize just how profound this very

141
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:07,919
basic body is so today i will

142
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,200
talk about mindfulness of the body as a friend

143
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,279
a way that we can have a support for our practice at all times

144
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:26,399
and then tomorrow we'll talk about um the four bodily knots

145
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:31,919
it's an um a list found in the teachings that's not taught very often four bodily

146
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:39,840
knots and then thursday we'll talk about the body as a support for concentration

147
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,519
for the gathering and stilling of the mind and on friday we'll talk about the body

148
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,960
as a vehicle of insight even liberating insight

149
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:58,880
so today is mindfulness of the body and the buddhist teachings

150
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,919
are just filled with ways that we can cultivate and get support

151
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:10,080
from mindfulness of the body and in particular there is a story

152
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:17,840
about the time that the buddha died and his cousin and attendant

153
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:24,640
ananda you may have heard that name he was very distraught naturally

154
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:32,399
he had been of course not only was he the buddha's cousin but he had been his personal attendant for

155
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:38,880
at least a couple of decades at that point and was of course very connected to him

156
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,039
and it hurt him deeply that his cousin had passed on and he

157
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,960
wasn't sure what you know what he was going to do after that and so but he did eventually go on with

158
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,760
his practice and became awakened and at that point he composed an awakening poem

159
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:06,240
as a number of the elder monks did and this is a little section from ananda's awakening poem

160
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:12,799
i'm completely disoriented the teachings don't spring to mind

161
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:18,480
with the passing of our good friend everything seems dark

162
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,240
when your friend has passed away your teacher is passed and gone there's

163
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,440
no friend like mindfulness of the body

164
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,880
so it's interesting right in that moment he came up with the idea of mindfulness

165
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:41,039
of the body as a friend so i want to talk a bit about mindfulness of the body as a

166
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:47,760
friend there are many ways of course to engage mindfulness of the body

167
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,720
many of them are talked about in the um discourse called the sati patana suta

168
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,320
the most basic instructions that we have about cultivating mindfulness of of all

169
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,720
different realms of experience but there's quite a long section about mindfulness of the body

170
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,000
and this this teaching includes a number of areas

171
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,040
one of them is the simple mindfulness of breathing in and out as we did during the meditation

172
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:25,679
one way this can be used is simply to calm the body it's always available the breath you

173
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,599
know it's something that we can touch into many different times during the day or

174
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:38,240
especially on the cushion and it's often at least as long as you haven't had difficult experiences with

175
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,520
the breath it's often a way to calm the body because it's a kind of a natural

176
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:50,320
rhythm coming in going out we can feel some ease through that

177
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:57,760
so this is one way that mindfulness is can be seen as quite friendly

178
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,680
there's also in this suta the mindfulness of postures [Music]

179
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,000
so literally knowing whether or not you are sitting or standing or walking or lying

180
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,440
down whatever posture you're in you just have conscious awareness that

181
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,359
that is the posture that the body is in i think it's a great way to start doing

182
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:28,320
mindfulness of the body practice in daily life so for example you could notice right now

183
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:35,440
that whatever posture you're in are you sitting maybe and do you know just take a moment to

184
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,520
know that you're sitting how you know that because you can feel the body in that posture

185
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:49,599
and you might notice that just breaking this to mind has a slight clarifying effect on the

186
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:56,560
mind there's a little sharpening of attention when we know a posture we're in

187
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:02,480
and since we're always in some posture this is a great way that we can

188
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,520
sharpen our mind up at any moment bring it into the present if it's in somewhere

189
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,920
else and just being clear about how we're how our body is disposed as

190
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,200
the way the suta says it and then another very

191
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:27,119
simple way to be mindful of the body is mindfulness of actions so this gets more specific to knowing what

192
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:33,359
it is we're doing at a given moment and the pseudo lists all kinds of things of

193
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:39,760
knowing that we're extending our arm or pulling it in knowing of course which posture we're in

194
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,800
knowing if we're talking or not knowing we're eating chewing swallowing even urinating and defecating

195
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,880
everything is included nothing is left out of what it is that we're doing

196
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,320
and so this is of course the yet another way to connect in and just be present

197
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:06,240
but i would say it goes farther in the case of knowing our specific actions then this practice becomes a basis for

198
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,320
ethical action so when we are noticing what we're doing

199
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,839
we can't help but be more aware of the quality of our actions

200
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:23,839
even when we bring in you know the supposedly neutral awareness of what we're doing

201
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:30,160
you know just knowing yes i'm raising the cup to my lips and having a

202
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:37,520
sip of water it's very natural as we do that

203
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,440
to also notice the quality of that action are we doing it in a hurried way are we

204
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,119
angry while we're doing it do we have an intention of harm in some way

205
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,240
so these things become much more available when we have mindfulness of actions

206
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,920
so this is really our friend right looking out for our ethical quality

207
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:07,040
so just recognizing what it is that we're doing as we're doing it is a great support for bringing more wholesomeness

208
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,160
into our life and then

209
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,160
as we get more familiar with these top-level actions of ways of being

210
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:25,440
mindful of the body and of course they can go very deep i don't mean to cast them only as surface level they can go

211
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,480
very deep but a new layer starts to get revealed when we tune into the subtler aspects of

212
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:39,040
the body you know there's kind of an energetic presence to the body often we feel it maybe more in

213
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,599
meditation but as we as we practice that it becomes more available in daily life

214
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:51,520
so sort of like the way we can't really hear you know bird song

215
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:59,119
or quiet music when we're standing on a busy street we don't always feel this underlying

216
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,640
energetic sensations of the body if we're rushing around in our daily life

217
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,400
but as we learn to feel them on the cushion they become more available to us off the cushion

218
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,320
and these these energetic sensations are more where those emotional

219
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,599
feelings are housed you know the the rush of energy that we feel when there's

220
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,960
anger coming up in the mind or the kind of slight heaviness that we feel in the

221
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:33,520
body when there's sadness or depression this is great information the way that

222
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,920
the mindfulness of the body if we carry it throughout the day can help us connect with our mind you

223
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:47,119
know sometimes in the press of being with other people or being on the computer or something else

224
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:52,640
our mind is going very fast and if we aren't tuned into the body we can miss

225
00:39:52,640 --> 00:40:00,079
some of what's going on for us and then we may react in ways that we don't understand or regret later so the body

226
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:07,440
has a lot of information in it as we and if we practice that on the cushion then we'll be able to bring that more into

227
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:14,240
our interactions so feeling the emotions and then one area that i emphasized in

228
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,520
the in the sit that i find i found very meaningful in my own practice

229
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:26,480
is to check in and tune into the relationship between thought and the body

230
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,720
it's not often emphasized but thinking actually does have an impact

231
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:39,359
in particular i've noticed that when i am thinking a lot on the cushion and i'm

232
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,839
trying to meditate but my mind is busy each time i return to

233
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:52,400
present moment awareness whatever my object was i noticed that there is kind of tendrils

234
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,920
of tension that run down from the head down into the shoulders and the chest

235
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,560
and into the neck can feel these um ways in which the thought has

236
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,880
tightened up certain channels in the body somehow and so if we can tune into that a little

237
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,960
bit sooner we may not get lost in thought quite as easily and also we may

238
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,400
learn to think in ways that are a little bit more healthy sometimes the

239
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:30,400
extreme tension that comes in with thought is because we've really gotten wrapped up in a story about ourself or a

240
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,240
thought of revenge or some other kind of thinking it's not actually very helpful

241
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,680
for our practice and there are there are kinds of thought that are more helpful than others

242
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,440
and you know for example thoughts about the dharma or thoughts about

243
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,720
ways that we can be helpful or things like that ways we could support people still thinking but it is

244
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,920
you know more conducive to our practice more in line with wholesomeness and

245
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,359
those kinds of thoughts you will notice don't produce quite as much tension

246
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:11,280
in the body in the belly or the chest or the throat so again we have

247
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:19,200
information coming in through mindfulness of the body that we might not have if we try only to see the mind

248
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,680
body is a great gateway into the mind so this is once again our friend our

249
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:32,480
friend mindfulness of the body helping us out in our practice helping us to learn more about this experience of

250
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:39,520
being human so that we can bring forth the best of that in our life

251
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,920
so once we start to see the body as a helpful experience to pay attention to

252
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,319
and we gain some skill in tuning into a variety of aspects of it like

253
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:58,160
physical feelings and the quality of our actions and also the more subtle energies that

254
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,560
tell us about emotions and thoughts then we're setting the stage to explore

255
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:11,520
also many other dharma practices that use the body and those are going to be the topics

256
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,680
that unfold as we go on with the week so we'll continue with that tomorrow

257
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,800
and i look forward to seeing you then if you can come

258
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,800
so be well you
