1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,040
hello my friends and I very much appreciate the gathering

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:20,400
of this meditation community that's represented by all of you who are chatting and greetings in the chat and u

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,760
for those of you who are not it's wonderful that you're here and I hope that you also appreciate that uh the

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,440
goodwill that's being expressed rest in the chat that may that represent all of

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,718
us um and how we hold each other

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:47,399
So mentioned something yesterday that I'd like to mention again today that the nature

7
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:56,360
of attention the nature of awareness is a little bit uh magical or

8
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:05,080
special because the way that we know many things is reconstructed in the

9
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:16,159
brain Uh the present moment experience comes in like when it comes in through the eyes Um it's a uh it comes in in

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,240
little packages of sense data pixels in a sense and then it gets recreated in

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:30,640
the mind and sometimes it gets recreated uh in a faulty way and for example when

12
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,079
still happens at least once a year or twice a year that I'm walking in the hills here hiking in the hills here and

13
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:43,799
I'm convinced that I see a snake and it's just a twisted root that's exposed exposed above the ground on the

14
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:52,320
trail And um and so the nature of awareness is that uh

15
00:01:52,320 --> 00:02:01,439
whatever we are aware of in the present moment um is kind of in some ways reconstructed

16
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:09,200
So if you're sitting in a room it's accurate enough to say you look around and see the room But the seeing of it

17
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:17,120
and the room are as you see it is the same thing Seeing and the room are seen

18
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,080
with the seeing of the wall Um the the wall appears in the seeing The capacity

19
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:32,560
to see and the wall don't really occur separately in the direct experience

20
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,239
And um and because it's all reconstructed inside the the skull in a

21
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,720
certain kind of way there's a way in which uh the whole experience is of

22
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:54,680
whatever we know in the present moment is in a certain way permeated by awareness by attention by sense ex sense

23
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,879
experience And I don't want to say that consciousness extends out into the physical world

24
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:09,080
But it's as if the experience everything we experience happens uh together

25
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,000
intimately inseparably from our capacity to be aware which involves many different

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,360
faculties of attention seeing hearing knowing sensing smelling all all coming

27
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,840
together And many of us are living in a world where it's very much centered on

28
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,840
how we construct things So just a memory is an example of that

29
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,799
So for this meditation I want to first emphasize that um that sometimes it's interesting

30
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:50,319
to consider that the weight of awareness the weight of that attention that is

31
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,239
coterminus with everything that is suffusing and

32
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,599
penetrating everything as we experience it in the mind as we reconstruct it in the

33
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:08,920
minds that that has no weight It's very light It's

34
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,760
open in and of itself There's a way in which awareness has no pressure and no

35
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,079
strain even though we might add it to that as extra

36
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:27,960
baggage And in the same way what I'd like to suggest for today and there's another quality that's

37
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,560
coterminus that's also can be susive in our experience that

38
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,919
also has no weight and that is

39
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:48,560
love That is kindness That is a not not even an

40
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:56,560
attitude but maybe an attitude or a feeling that everything that we touch

41
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,600
know feel experience is

42
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:11,320
known with love weightless love a a warmth a tenderness a

43
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,199
kindness a care an

44
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:25,800
appreciation maybe a kind of respect which is also sused with

45
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,919
love And I use the word love here to be a broad term that each of you maybe can

46
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,000
find your own way to do this but to practice

47
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
samadei with love So

48
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:52,440
that starting to immerse yourself into this world of of meditation the world of

49
00:05:52,440 --> 00:06:00,600
samadei is more attractive more engaging more like yes this is good this is

50
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:08,199
nice Of course the mind wants to be centered here Of course the mind doesn't want to wander off when you're in this

51
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:15,120
wonderful pool of awareness that is suffused with love

52
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,039
Love that is sused with present moment awareness Not love that requires a lot

53
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:29,639
of thinking Maybe no thinking almost but just the nature of awareness

54
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,840
almost is with a care a tenderness a

55
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:42,160
gentleness love So to assume a meditation

56
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,319
posture and [Music]

57
00:06:51,800 --> 00:07:00,360
to as you assume a posture if possible assume care

58
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,198
kindness for this body for this posture

59
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:20,400
A kind of gratitude and appreciation for this body sitting

60
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:28,880
here and to feel more deeply into this

61
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,039
caring body caring for this time and place yourself here

62
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,160
Gently close your

63
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,319
eyes and without doing anything

64
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:57,360
else feel the places in your body that are tense muscles are being held where

65
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,479
there's tightness And don't relax them Don't let

66
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:11,039
go and soften yet Instead meet those places the aches and

67
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:18,000
pains and tensions with love and care

68
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:27,840
compassion caring for them caring for their well-being That that's the

69
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:35,640
orientation And then as you

70
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,159
exhale to allow for

71
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,599
release in your

72
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,519
body Allow for a softening around the holding the aches the

73
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,519
tensions

74
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:11,120
Allow for release without needing release to

75
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:20,320
happen because the love the goodwill the kindness is

76
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,920
there regardless

77
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:33,600
Simple weightless care kindness

78
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:45,640
love feeling the tensions the holding in the mind the thinking

79
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:52,279
mind At first do nothing more than feel it with compassion with

80
00:09:52,279 --> 00:10:00,399
care almost as if it's good for the mind the thinking

81
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,120
mind to be acknowledged and recognized how it is to be

82
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,320
seen with respect and care

83
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,519
And then allow the thinking mind to release to

84
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,680
relax allowing thoughts to float away like thought

85
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,000
bubbles that evaporate

86
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,040
And then finding in your body is there a location your in your

87
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,839
body that you most associate with

88
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:10,800
love with kindness or care

89
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,160
compassion And if there is take a little bit of time to feel

90
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,040
that part of your

91
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,519
body Breathe with it

92
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,959
And if there is any bit of kindness or love here now in

93
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:53,839
you gently feel the weightlessness of it the

94
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:03,079
lightness of it that way in which it has no demands

95
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,200
No fear Just a very simple simplest forms

96
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,920
of love

97
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,480
care Breathing with it Breathing through

98
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,800
it And maybe just maybe

99
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,760
You can find love care

100
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:50,639
kindness susing your capacity for to be

101
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:59,120
aware Attention awareness the way you know anything in the present

102
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:06,040
moment is known with a even

103
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:14,759
modest undemanding attitude of care kindness

104
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:30,519
And to let that awareness kind

105
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:37,079
awareness loving awareness Now begin to

106
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:41,079
accompany breathing

107
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,000
As if breathing is

108
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,839
surrounded by loving awareness

109
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:13,399
Where that loving awareness lightly tenderly

110
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:18,399
rests on breathing in and breathing

111
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:37,120
out That love has something precious to attend to

112
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,480
that love has an

113
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:50,639
object an experience of breathing that arises together with

114
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:57,320
there being love Not that you have to bring love to

115
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,959
it but the very experience itself of

116
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:11,199
breathing is inseparable from an awareness of that

117
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:18,560
has care love kindness

118
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,639
and staying close to this caring attention loving attention

119
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,600
Staying close to where it meets and mingles

120
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,279
with breathing

121
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:22,320
And you can lower yourself into that pool of

122
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,079
loving awareness Lower yourself into the resting place

123
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:34,800
the grounding place of breathing

124
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:43,199
floating lightly openly

125
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:52,040
continuously in the pool of breathing in and out

126
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,279
Awareness breathing

127
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:13,279
With the expanding and contracting sensations of breathing let there be the

128
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:23,480
expanding extending opening movement of Love care

129
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,840
letting go of thoughts in such a way that there's

130
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:58,039
more space in the mind vast open

131
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:04,039
space quietness that can be

132
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:10,440
filled with awareness Love with a

133
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,759
love of

134
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:26,919
awareness So that somehow the experience of breathing in and breathing out

135
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,679
And you are immersed in the wider and bigger

136
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:42,639
field of openness an open field of

137
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:51,960
love with breathing at the center Breathing

138
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:03,000
as the nest to be cozy with

139
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:41,880
When we're immersed in the field of awareness Awareness immersed in

140
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,840
samade immersed in

141
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,480
breathing Sometimes it can feel that's not

142
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:02,320
us that is doing it but we are on the receiving end We're

143
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,039
being done too It's not that we

144
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:13,850
love but we are being loved by this

145
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:20,919
[Music] profound immersion

146
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
Deeply

147
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:37,240
centered in a pool of samadei

148
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:12,559
And if you find yourself thinking in these last minute or so

149
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,320
don't don't let go of your thoughts

150
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:26,559
We say the mind wanders away wondering off in

151
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:34,279
thoughts Don't bring them back Don't bring the mind back

152
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:40,039
Instead extend your love out to

153
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:45,360
where your mind goes Extend your love

154
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:52,320
beyond the edges of whatever you're thinking So thinking is held within

155
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,960
awareness Love awareness Awareness Love

156
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:15,360
And then bring to mind think

157
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:21,840
about what you'll be doing in the next hour or so after this

158
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:32,200
meditation And let your awareness love become bigger and bigger to hold

159
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:38,520
that those thoughts those ideas those places those

160
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,679
people all held within this field of

161
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:54,320
care And imagine that [Music] your awareness

162
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:01,760
love expands outwards into the wide

163
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,640
world where nothing is outside of

164
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:14,120
it A vast field like

165
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:21,640
the atmosphere of the earth the atmosphere of the mind

166
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:29,640
that holds everything in a field of kindness care love

167
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,960
Maybe arising with the inhale expanding with the

168
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:47,399
inhale lovingly returning on the inhale on the exhale

169
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:13,080
In this wide world that we share with other living beings may our care our love our

170
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:19,080
kindness extend out to include all living

171
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:27,559
beings all people May all beings be happy

172
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,279
May all beings be safe May all

173
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:45,278
beings be peaceful May all beings be

174
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:57,799
free And may may we as we go through the day

175
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,720
Stay close to our practice of

176
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,760
awareness as if whatever we're aware

177
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:18,279
of we touch it with kindness touch it with

178
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:23,919
love And maybe no one else needs to know

179
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,360
Maybe it doesn't have to be more complicated or elaborate than

180
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:38,000
that And see how your day is If everything that you're aware

181
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:47,799
of is a touching with awareness is touching with love

182
00:30:54,250 --> 00:31:04,079
[Music]

183
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,600
Thank you

184
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:06,679
So hello and welcome to this continuing series on

185
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:13,799
samadei and now that we're been doing it for good number of

186
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:20,480
weeks I'm now bringing it to uh introducing We're more than

187
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:28,080
introducing now bringing you into the approach stage of samadei and it's approaching a deep

188
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:35,360
immersion a deep kind of clicking in a deep kind of settling into just here

189
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,760
It's almost like a physiological shift and change like where we become

190
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:49,519
so fully here that the mind you know is is is clearly at home

191
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:58,559
clearly settled clearly has no inclination to wander off and um and it's a deeply satisfying

192
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,799
immersion into something wonderful And so the approach stage is is

193
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,159
beginning to appreciate this movement movement to immersion movement onward to

194
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,880
really being here And part of that is to begin

195
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:22,240
recognizing the symptoms of sami the feelings that feel good about somebody

196
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,360
that um that are the encouragement are the kind of the symptoms are the very

197
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,640
things that the awareness wants to stay connected to awareness wants mindfulness

198
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:39,640
wants to stay here wants to know this Um it's like standing in the sun on a cold

199
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,399
day and the system the body kind of almost like it wants to stay

200
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:51,679
there you know with it fully facing the sun so we get the maximum amount of heat

201
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:58,399
on the body And um so there's something in our whole system that wants to be here because it's so good It's so

202
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,919
nourishing So good And classically

203
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,760
uh more often there's a lot of attention given to the

204
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:16,480
joy pleasure that can come as we get into this approach stage And it's the

205
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,760
it's being kind of absorbed into the pleasure the joy that is kind of the

206
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,720
avenue to this deep deep immersion of samadei But sometimes that emphasis on pleasure

207
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:35,040
and joy is a little bit too technique focused a little bit too maybe much

208
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,599
desire involved It little bit too narrow scope of what the full immersion can be

209
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:47,200
And so in this last meditation I introduced the topic of love

210
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:53,520
The Buddha did describe beautifully uh states of samadei deep absorption in the

211
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,160
Brahma viharas in these divine forms of sublime love which are we capable of The

212
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:07,520
first one being um kindness or goodwill or loving kindness and then compassion

213
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,880
and sympathetic joy and the particular kind of equinimity called uh love

214
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,160
particular kind of love called equinimity But there this kind of sense

215
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,760
of tenderness or rightness or goodness or a kind of a love that's there This is

216
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:30,320
good This is uh and so uh to begin

217
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,240
feeling that uh there's care there's love there's uh gentleness there's a

218
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,000
friendliness there's a a feeling of goodwill to what's happening It's not

219
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,200
greedy to be enter into somebody It's not you know narrowing down to just feel

220
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,800
pleasure for pleasure's sake It's um or joy for joy joy sake It's just a little

221
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:03,440
bit too narrow Um it's the uh uh the the love the goodwill is a support to keep

222
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,640
it all very light and to keep it from being selfish to keep it from being

223
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:17,440
um about me myself and mine It it gives kind of a wider space a wider goodwill a

224
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,240
wider sense of of um of not

225
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,640
contracting in for the Buddha when he talked about you know just a penult

226
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:35,200
penultimate kind of obstacle to really deep going deep into the well-being of

227
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:43,359
samadei um are the five hindrances one of them which is ill will And so this idea of

228
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:52,000
ill will getting in the way even the subtlest little not liking subtlest little not for this not this Um there's

229
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,359
plenty of experiences we can be having in meditation that are unpleasant The body can ache the mind can be

230
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:05,280
challenging and the heart can have its difficult emotions and we don't want to

231
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:11,760
push them away or think they don't belong there But uh there's a way of including them so that we're not

232
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,560
preoccupied by them by and this is where love can hold it

233
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:23,359
all that the and this idea that awareness itself is love Mindfulness

234
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:30,160
itself is a kind of love And uh one of my favorite reference points for this uh

235
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,800
well so it's favorite and also maybe sad reference points uh but is that um I've

236
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,400
learned as a teacher and talking with a lot of people about their lives that

237
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,160
when they were children if they were not really seen if the parents kind of

238
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,680
ignored them or never really stopped to get to know them or saw their difficulties saw their challenges saw

239
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:01,200
their joys that uh they were kind of overlooked by the busyiness of or the preoccupations or the alcoholism of

240
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,480
their parents That not being seen as children is equivalent to

241
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:13,359
not being loved not feeling that they're loved And uh there's something about the

242
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:20,320
act of seeing as adults There's something about the act of people stopping to to listen to really listen

243
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:28,640
out and hear that is so nourishing so good that uh uh when people listen well

244
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:36,400
it's because there's a kind of a deep care a love here So this love of samadei this love

245
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,000
that can be part of awareness doesn't have to be a dramatic thing It doesn't

246
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,359
have to be something that um people write songs about but rather it's

247
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:54,960
something very soft something very gentle something very modest something that is very kind of pervasive and fluid

248
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,880
but it helps with this Yes this is good This is really

249
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,040
nice to be here Of course I want to be here Of course I want to enter into this

250
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:14,839
world of of experience If the experience itself has this wonderful light

251
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:21,280
uh inviting awareness if experience itself comes along with this inviting

252
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,640
sense of love or care that is not added

253
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:34,920
to being aware but is part of being aware Um you know it's possible to be

254
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:42,560
aware unself-consciously It's possible to be aware of things that we're not really focusing on Uh we go through the

255
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:51,200
day talking with a friend walking walking through a park and we might step over a branch or a lizard in the path or

256
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,800
something We might kind of avoid a rock or something We're aware

257
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:03,520
of the rock We're aware of all these things simple things in the park but we're not focusing on them It's uh it

258
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:10,440
the the degree to which we know it is almost effortless because we're involved in you know conversation and looking

259
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:16,040
around and so we have this capacity for very very simple

260
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:22,640
unobtrusive or undemanding kind of awareness that uh in the same way we can

261
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:31,280
do that for care and kindness Um the uh you know maybe there's a a

262
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:37,119
earthworm on the trail as you're walking and you would step on it if you just

263
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:43,520
continued the way you are but it's the most natural thing in the world to step aside to put the foot down a little bit

264
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:51,040
different place so you don't hurt the the worm It's a kind of care It's a kind of love but it's not self-conscious It's

265
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:57,119
not just a big thing It's you don't even realize in two seconds later you probably don't even remember you did it

266
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:05,000
Uh it's not in your mind So to immerse ourselves in the simplicity of awareness simplicity of

267
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,920
care don't make somebody a difficult big complicated thing It's a dipping into

268
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,280
the pool into this immersion into this state It's so we're looking for the

269
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:24,000
symptoms of somebody and one of the symptoms is that um the mind wants to be

270
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,839
present wants to be there And when that awareness kind of wants to be there look

271
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:36,319
for the love look for the care And that then is part of the funnel that keeps us

272
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:42,560
kind of there and wanting to be there Look for the joy Look for the pleasure

273
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,680
Look for how the satisfac the satisfactory feelings Maybe there's kind

274
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,599
of a the body feels much more light than it has no weight Maybe the

275
00:41:53,599 --> 00:42:01,200
body feels very spacious and open and kind of be in that space Feel it Be it

276
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:09,359
Maybe there's a delightful tingling or a vibration or a sense of vitality aliveness that comes Be in that Feel

277
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:15,760
that These are all symptoms Sometimes people have experiences of of

278
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,839
uh light the eyesight filled with luminous with maybe a white field of

279
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:28,240
light or clear clear field of kind of light Maybe it's colored light Don't

280
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,760
focus on them Uh don't get messmerized by them But that's part of the kind of

281
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,440
delightful things the symptom of samadei where you can kind of accept it and and

282
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,680
and appreciate how yes I'm on track This is where I want to be Let the color the

283
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:51,680
colors the lights let them be there on the periphery Uh let them be a part of

284
00:42:51,680 --> 00:43:00,079
the goodness of it that wants to keep you right there with the breathing staying there staying connected

285
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:05,359
So with approach at the approach stage of samadei

286
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:11,280
um it's helpful to start appreciating the symptoms of samadei how what's

287
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,920
shifted and changed the calm that's arisen Sometimes the the mind can feel

288
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,200
very incisively that's the right word precisely or

289
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:28,880
penetratingly sharp in its attention awareness right there And um and it

290
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:36,960
doesn't have to be with any kind of strain but there oh this is good to be there sharply precisely right there on

291
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,480
the breath or it can feel like awareness is like a petting a cat and the breath

292
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,599
is the the petting almost and or the awareness that's resting on it and

293
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:55,200
something begins to purr inside And so the symptoms of sami and

294
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:02,280
one of those being love care and that um that's one of the great

295
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:09,359
gifts of Buddhism of samadei of practice is to

296
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:14,480
feel the the almost almost the oneness of

297
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,599
awareness and love that you can carry with you into

298
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:26,720
the world So that whatever awareness touches is

299
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:34,480
also touched by love with care with kindness And you'll lose touch with that

300
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:40,400
You'll get caught up in your thoughts and preoccupations But know that you've lost

301
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,560
it Know that you're no longer doing it Maybe just recognizing it that

302
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:51,240
difference can bring you back into this relaxed way in

303
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:58,440
which awareness love awareness that is

304
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:06,040
love can can then return to becoming part of how you walk through the

305
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:14,000
world May you love may you walk through the world with awareness Love

306
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,319
Thank you
