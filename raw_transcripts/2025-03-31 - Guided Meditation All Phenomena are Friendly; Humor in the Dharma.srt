grateful to uh Gil for for having me um

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,719
so let us uh yeah let us let us practice together

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,520
so finding um finding a

8
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:06,600
posture balances alertness and uh deep relaxation

9
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,360
because we have so much

10
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,159
fidelity to the last

11
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:04,439
moment and to all the ideas and models of self and

12
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:13,239
world can feel like freedom is very far away in this moment

13
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,599
perhaps not so far

14
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,159
we might begin by

15
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:15,000
just forgetting everything we know about ourselves

16
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,319
ceasing to turn yourself into an

17
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:40,879
object to be assessed that is the beacon the

18
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,599
orienting point

19
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,560
it's hard to forget ourselves it's hard to simultaneously remember

20
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,800
the emptiness of all points of identification

21
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,759
but we

22
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,280
train this clears out some fresh

23
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,600
space for you to just breathe

24
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,759
to just be a body rewarded

25
00:05:52,759 --> 00:06:02,360
by oxygen expelling what's used up

26
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,160
enjoy it

27
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,440
this sense of self accumulates sort of behind the radar of

28
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,680
awareness like dust on a shelf

29
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:08,240
sense of pressure to prove something to perform something to be

30
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,759
something we relax

31
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:31,719
we uh [Music] receive each breath like a gift and

32
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,719
a surprise

33
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,640
feels like in each moment we must take

34
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,399
care of all our future

35
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:08,160
selves that all those future selves are depending on this self

36
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:25,320
now it's a lot of pressure

37
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:46,480
as we come to be less intimidated by Anicha

38
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,200
uncertainty feel less responsible for all the future

39
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,399
iterations of

40
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:18,560
feel safer to relax into the uh open space of

41
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,480
uh this moment this breath

42
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,559
we can be precise

43
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,480
without tension

44
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,080
sometimes useful to notice the beginning and ending of

45
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,400
the inhalation the beginning and ending of the exhalation

46
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,640
and then the bottom of your

47
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,559
breath it's a sense of

48
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:15,559
release surrender

49
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,240
then it begins

50
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
again so many opportunities to begin

51
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:45,240
again so many opportunities to soften to the moment

52
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,158
all phenomena are

53
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:35,039
friendly from the perspective of dharma all phenomena are friendly

54
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,000
even though some hurt

55
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:20,360
okay good to uh practice with you

56
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:31,480
um so there are uh a lot of lists in

57
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:38,360
Buddhism and uh they're really so um so

58
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:46,799
profound and uh sometimes kind of marvel at the the genius of how the different

59
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:52,720
factors fit together and um work for our um growing

60
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,039
wisdom and uh compassion

61
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:05,919
and there are lots of kind of spiritual factors that don't show up on on the

62
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:12,240
lists and um I kind of made up a list uh

63
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,039
a couple years ago and now kind of uh rethought it a little bit and revised

64
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:24,799
and Um and so the theme this week is like basically my fake list you know

65
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:30,960
Matthew from California's fake list not seven factors of awakening or five

66
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,080
johnic factors or something it's just but things that have been meaningful to

67
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,200
me on my path and uh offer for whatever it's

68
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,799
worth so I was

69
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:54,720
um talking to a yogi after a retreat and um and they said something like you know

70
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,919
I'm I'm suspicious of I I kind of asked like how was the

71
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,960
retreat or something like that you know i was like uh you know was I a little

72
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,679
too playful or something you know cuz I remember trying to be relaxed you know

73
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:17,600
and um they said like no I'm suspicious of teachers who lack a sense of humor

74
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,279
the lack of humor usually means they haven't reached deep into the mystery is

75
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:30,399
what they said and sort of stuck with me because for a long time I thought dharma

76
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,840
practice was serious business and dharma teaching that's even

77
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:43,960
more serious right um but I'll

78
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:50,720
uh I'll tell you how I got my nickname uh Captain

79
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,600
Buzzkill was awarded to me by my brother and

80
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:08,120
uh younger brother and I have a lot of joy in my life but not much excitement

81
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:15,240
uh you not cuz I'm like trying to be all Buddhist and be present and

82
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,799
uh you know trying to like be in the m it's not like that some of it's

83
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:28,080
temperamental some of it's probably practice a lot of joy when things come but not look so much looking forward and

84
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:34,880
my younger brother lives on excitement kind of you know um and looking forward

85
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,240
to things and he was telling me something he was excited about and I you

86
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,159
know I was kind of just misattuned and I sort of you know reminded him of like

87
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:52,240
the first noble truth and wanting is always different than getting and and he

88
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:59,000
was just like you know who you are you're Captain Buzzkill and still years

89
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,159
later as I've told that story sometimes yogis from sas far and wide just come up

90
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,240
to me and call me captain so

91
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:19,240
um today on the fake list the first factor uh humor and

92
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:26,240
playfulness and there's this sense that the the intensity and poignency of life

93
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,760
is somehow incompatible with laughter and play and

94
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:38,878
humor and it's not and one of the kind of gifts of

95
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:44,960
dharma practice is how quickly even strong forces can move through us

96
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:52,320
opening us to a very different moment even a moment of grief followed by peace

97
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,880
or joy and the seriousness the seriousness

98
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,480
is is some of it may be sincere but it's often driven by ego the

99
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:15,000
ego is by nature serious it's uh the ego doesn't think it's

100
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,720
funny but it is it's very funny

101
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,520
when experience um becomes more light a

102
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:35,280
little less bounded by the self story spacious there's a lot more room

103
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:42,440
for lightness for humor and it's always like curious

104
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,599
um like it's amusing to hear when you

105
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:54,400
know like the senior teachers uh the agon in the Thai forest tradition when

106
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,839
they laugh is very funny to me when they laugh

107
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:07,359
because they laugh at things that I don't really think are funny you know like a tomato is it be like well but

108
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,680
that didn't work out too well did

109
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,720
it very funny it's almost like

110
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:25,280
um yeah we have to be able to laugh at ourselves the uh writer George uh

111
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:33,200
Saunders says "Humor is what happens when we're told the truth quicker and more directly than

112
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:40,000
we're used to." That's a very useful humor is what happens when

113
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,680
we're told the truth quicker and more directly than we're used to and the dharma is like that sometimes it just

114
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:54,119
sneaks up on you and there's nothing to do but laugh

115
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:02,960
humor and um and playfulness they're so um they're kind of a central part of uh

116
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,880
kalana mitaa spiritual friendship often you know and

117
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:15,480
um and my my kind of dharma friendships you

118
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,640
know you know fellow practitioners teaching colleagues and it's like we

119
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:27,440
laugh a lot a lot um Freud said um those who share a sense

120
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,480
of humor share a whole lot more and and it you can kind of sense that when when

121
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,000
when two people find the same thing funny it often testifies to something

122
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,599
deep about their mind maybe what's not even conscious

123
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:51,680
something that is is deeply shared and to meet in that is um is

124
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:59,079
beautiful uh Nietze said that um maturity is

125
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:05,520
re-acquiring the spirit that um a child has at

126
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:12,560
play and what are the characteristics of playing how can dharma practice be

127
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,560
sometimes a little bit more like playing well the characteristics of

128
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,599
playing are there's nonvigilance we cannot play when we're

129
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:29,839
patrolling when we're patrolling the boundaries or something

130
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:35,640
like that when we're keeping tabs on every potential

131
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,720
threat we play in the absence of

132
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,280
self-consciousness you cannot play if you're trying to look cool or smart or

133
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:52,160
whatever trying to look anything play is the absence of a kind

134
00:38:52,160 --> 00:39:00,280
of self-consciousness and so this inclusion of our whole being we're at ease with ourselves and in a kind of

135
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:07,920
flow and play is intrinsically rewarding we're not getting anywhere in our play

136
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:16,599
some people it's hard to tolerate that not getting anywhere it's important

137
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:24,000
psychoanalyst um Winnott says psychotherapy takes place at the overlap

138
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,240
of two areas of playing that of the patient and that of the

139
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:34,440
therapist psychotherapy has to do with two people playing

140
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:40,200
together where playing's not possible the work done by the therapist is

141
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:47,359
directed towards bringing the patient from a state of not being able to play

142
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:52,240
into a state of being able to

143
00:39:52,760 --> 00:40:01,640
play a state of not being able to play into a state of being able to play

144
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:12,200
and a lot of that can be said for dharma too for a practice where can we

145
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:21,960
play where can the self-consciousness de dissolve where can sense of just aimless

146
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:29,599
exploration just delight uh where can that be and then

147
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:39,000
where can we not play can we play with our foy balls and

148
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,960
play in the zones of clinging or even play in zones of

149
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:53,480
shame play i want to play everywhere

150
00:40:53,839 --> 00:41:01,560
and as the the egoic framework becomes less of an

151
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:08,359
organizing kind of system you know as we we come to feel less and less like we

152
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:16,280
orbit around the self story we open to more humor and

153
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:23,640
play and we come to play even with the conventions of self

154
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,160
in other words we become the joke and it feels very good you know sometimes I've

155
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,440
been you know I like like making fun of myself and maybe that's like

156
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,800
subterranean self-hatred but I I don't think so i think it's just there's kind

157
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,400
of um there's some some delight in playing

158
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,560
with the conventions of self you know

159
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,480
it's like part of how I relate to my defilements is through

160
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:05,119
humor you know and and sometimes you can sense like oh the mind could go more

161
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,359
than one way it could go into shame or pain or

162
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:17,520
defensiveness or humor and we just play play with the conventions of self play

163
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,760
even in our places of pain or

164
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:31,160
wounding okay yeah some lightness there

165
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:40,760
we move from a state of not being able to play to a state of being able to

166
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:48,440
play and become progressively less defensive less rigid our

167
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:55,160
holding our fidelity to who we think we should be

168
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:06,880
some years ago I went to this um it was like a breathing workshop with a couple dharma friends fellow practitioner you

169
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,680
know practitioner and was not a Buddhist practice and I got into a very curious

170
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,880
mind state that I had never been in until then and have never been in since

171
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,920
then it was not in the It was not in the

172
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:31,560
progress of insight it was not in you know it was not a Janna it was very

173
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:37,440
strange so it was a 90minute session we're all in the dark people's heads are

174
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,920
all pointed towards the center of the circle and uh maybe an hour in I start

175
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:50,040
and and I start to hear um the woman next to me

176
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:56,160
crying and uh in this kind of very poorest state

177
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,880
it's like it was not felt totally effortless to just

178
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:09,200
attune to that and to join and I start

179
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:16,640
crying that is not so you know uncommon for me i cry most times I give dharma

180
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,760
talks or uh you know practice much but

181
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:28,359
um okay I'm crying but then also there's something about it that just I'm

182
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:34,319
laughing deeply you know it's kind of like this

183
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:40,560
sense of zooming out to the cosmic wildness of it all and I'm just I'm

184
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:50,599
crying and I'm laughing hard and beneath all of it it's like

185
00:44:50,599 --> 00:45:00,079
um miles under the surface of the sea and it just abiding perv peace

186
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:08,000
uh pervading all of it and it was like those with three very

187
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,920
distinct mind states totally

188
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:25,920
co-occurring crying laughter peace not blotting one another

189
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:32,200
out so

190
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:38,800
um humor playfulness on the path

191
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:45,119
