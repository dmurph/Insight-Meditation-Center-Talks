1
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:42,259
testing testing it how's the volume is it a little soft a little low seems soft right

2
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,360
is that better

3
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:11,220
okay yeah we're gonna uh we were gonna

4
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:18,840
decided to start um with a guided meditation since people kind of trickle in and instead of

5
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:25,020
waiting or starting the intro we just thought we'd start with a meditation does that sound good to you guys

6
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,560
okay

7
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,220
all right okay great

8
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,060
yeah so welcome

9
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:50,479
just sort of welcoming yourself into the moment

10
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,319
getting settled

11
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:06,360
and maybe even you know orienting to your space Wherever You Are

12
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,500
looking around

13
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,720
this is sort of helping your your mind and body acknowledge being here in this

14
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,180
moment in this place letting the eyes see

15
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,680
letting the body feel

16
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,620
just here right here

17
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,140
in the sounds

18
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:52,380
I find that when I'm starting to get that alignment between the body and the

19
00:08:52,380 --> 00:09:00,600
mind and oriented to hear it's almost like there's more

20
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:08,480
substance or gravity more weight to my body

21
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,880
I'm just noticing if there's a shift that starts to happen for you and how

22
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,779
that is for you

23
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,660
the settling Landing arriving

24
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,980
and as you do arrive

25
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,720
noticing what you find in the body here

26
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,080
what are you aware of

27
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,519
can you feel where your hands are touching each other

28
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:33,079
maybe noticing your shut neck and shoulders

29
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:43,260
seeing if the body would benefit from lifting the shoulders up or

30
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,140
pulling the back stretching open the chest

31
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,540
taking a few deeper breaths

32
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,380
and during your meditation tonight just paying particular

33
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:46,680
kind of a gently curious attention to areas

34
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,440
where there's some ease or letting go

35
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,440
I'm just noticing it may be fleeting

36
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,500
maybe it's a little shy so when you turn your attention toward

37
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,959
it it dissipates

38
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:37,640
maybe it warms up when you attend

39
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,579
broadens expands

40
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:36,440
you can tune into the breath and notice

41
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:43,800
just the change even there of ease and release and the whole process of

42
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,820
breathing in

43
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,240
and then the transition to breathing out

44
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:03,240
it might be certain parts of the breath that feel like a letting go or

45
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,040
easing up that happens

46
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:29,300
and just sort of gently inviting the mind to rest

47
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,940
those little moments or pockets of ease when they're there

48
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,620
for however long they're there

49
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:24,180
you may be aware of a constant sort of tensing and relaxing

50
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:29,639
kind of a like a tide moving in and out

51
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,579
or you might also be aware of a broader sense

52
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:43,639
of ease it's allowing the breath to just sort of flow in and out

53
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,760
and every this once in a while just sort of dropping in the question

54
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:04,679
where is their ease or is there a sense of letting go

55
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:11,840
resting could be in the toe

56
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:56,720
and the ease may come and go or maybe there's just a lot of tension

57
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:05,780
stress or tightness and that's that can be seen and held

58
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,280
an awareness you don't need to try and change

59
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,720
anything see if you can just notice

60
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:23,840
whatever is there with the ease or the tension

61
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:36,200
being open to it all as best you can

62
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:34,260
you might also be curious about um whether there's ease in the body in the

63
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,179
mind or both

64
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:25,220
I was taking the last few minutes of the meditation to

65
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:31,559
tune in to the relationship between ease and being

66
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:37,500
aware of it is it like a cat that wants to be pet

67
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:47,220
and it kind of comes closer purrs or like a shy animal that

68
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:52,080
when it's seen sort of hides

69
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,980
how does the ease respond to being seen

70
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,500
how does the Mind respond to ease

71
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,250
[Music]

72
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:49,559
so before Kim introduces herself and gets us started just to take a moment to

73
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:55,320
see if there's anything you want to share about what you noticed in your meditation

74
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:01,260
about you know how were you able to notice ease where what happened when you

75
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:07,220
noticed you both have microphones so ideal

76
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:25,500
um I feel like for me being at ease is very unnatural and my

77
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,899
like Baseline state is usually like anxious [Music] um

78
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:37,320
but I feel like it was helpful like I feel like you kind of added in like little reminders along the way and it

79
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:42,779
did help me like just try to like ease my body at first and

80
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:48,299
let that take me to a place where I'm like not super stressed out and

81
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:57,360
I tried to think of like situations in the past or moments where I did feel fully at ease like

82
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,820
sitting at a bonfire or like watching a movie things like that that

83
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:08,399
kind of helped me like remember what it feels like to be

84
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,679
in that state so and did you happen to notice any moments

85
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:20,100
here in the moment that you felt these where you were aware of actually

86
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,480
experiencing it now

87
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:33,000
I don't know if yeah sometimes like just remembering can help change what we're

88
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,360
feeling or maybe you were more aware of what was happening in your mind than in your body do you have any

89
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:48,120
I was trying to be like it's a China like the body scan kind of

90
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:53,940
um that kind of helps me like feel more present I guess but

91
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:00,960
I don't know if I don't know if I know what it feels like to be fully at ease I don't know if I

92
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,960
yeah it is it's on I don't know if I if I was yeah

93
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,679
no you don't need to be fully at ease there can be little pockets of ease but that's great thank you for sharing

94
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,960
how are you Michael um I think for myself I've become more accustomed to getting into the routine

95
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,440
of meditation when I first started I felt like I was harder on myself if I would think of something a bird or a

96
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,659
ball or something come into my mind I would kind of um reprimand myself like

97
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:38,100
oh we're supposed to be just focusing on the breath and so now things will still come into my mind but I'm not as hard on

98
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:43,980
myself so now a question is it working am I am I um am I letting down my guard

99
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:50,820
or whatnot because I notice like you know sometimes I'll catch myself being a little bit more Mindful and I think oh

100
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:55,460
it is working but I'm still cautiously optimistic

101
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,080
thank you Michael you want to respond Kim or just to shift whatever you want

102
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,320
to do

103
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,580
if I take this off

104
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:35,340
guys I think I'll just say that um for many people ease is an acquired

105
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:42,120
taste and it is common to feel like in fact this

106
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,880
is going to be kind of a theme running through I think what both Tanya and I are going to say is that we're not so

107
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,919
accustomed to noticing these because we're always much more tuned to noticing

108
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:58,679
what's wrong or the tensions or the problems or the possible threats and all

109
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:05,760
the things that come into the mind and it can be something of a surprise that on this path

110
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:12,360
um noticing ease and attuning to it and even appreciating it

111
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,580
is actually a big part of it and so that's what we're exploring this

112
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:25,080
evening actually is this um next of the Four Noble Truths shall we just get into that okay I know that

113
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:31,080
neither of you know me so I'll say that I'm a teacher here at IMC also and I was

114
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:38,399
very delighted to be invited by Tanya to be here for part of this series this is a wonderful series that's being

115
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,580
offered with Tanya each week and Sandra and then I just get to slip in for the best night

116
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:50,279
about freedom I feel so honored to be here tonight so

117
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:56,159
um so this Four Noble Truths that we're talking about this month

118
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:02,279
sometimes the four noble truths are called the teaching special to the Buddhas

119
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:08,700
it's like yeah you know a lot of people teach meditation or they teach relaxation or they teach self-awareness

120
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:15,839
and all these different terms but these four noble truths are said to be kind of the essence of what what is offered in

121
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,599
this particular set of teachings and I like them very much because they

122
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,358
can be comprehended pretty well at a top level there's nothing esoteric about any

123
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:35,520
of these truths and we'll talk more about this word truth but also each one of them goes very deep

124
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,878
and you could be unfolded over a whole lifetime to understand any one of them even though

125
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:48,358
we can also get it at a top level so each of the four has a task that's

126
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:56,398
associated with it so we've talked about the first Noble Truth a couple weeks ago the truth of dukkha and the task for

127
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:03,780
that one is that it's to be understood you know we're to comprehend what it is that this is of course we think at a top

128
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:09,420
level yeah I get it and we do you know we know about stress we know about struggle we

129
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:15,839
know about pain grief anxiety all the things that cause us

130
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:23,220
difficulty in our life and those are part of dukkha um but do we know it thoroughly

131
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:30,000
so the task of this truth to you know to comprehend or to understand dukkha

132
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,940
um we need to really investigate carefully you know where is that coming from what are all the different forms of

133
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:43,440
Duca are there things that I think are totally acceptable and normal in my life that are actually stress and Duca

134
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,960
and the short answer is yes so we're asked to look again to look again at

135
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,020
what we're calling suffering and seeing more carefully what it is and if we do

136
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:01,440
that we might begin to see more than just our initial impression so we might

137
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,099
sort of broaden our perspective to see what is also present when there's dukkha

138
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:15,060
that's the one of the questions that the Buddha asked you know what is here alongside duka every time I feel

139
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:20,280
stressed or I'm struggling in some way what else is here usually we're so

140
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,880
focused in on the difficulty and what I'm going to do about it and how horrible it is that we don't broaden the

141
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,520
perspective to see that every time there's dukkha there's also craving

142
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:39,960
we're clinging that's what was talked about last week that's what um so the Buddha named craving or tanha

143
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,720
as something that is present along with duka so it's this is the truth of the

144
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,820
arising of duka when duka arises there's one of these also there you don't have

145
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:58,619
to believe me you can just check for yourself in experience and so um the task

146
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:03,720
for this second Noble Truth is to abandon it Sandra talked last week very

147
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,140
nicely about the three kinds of craving craving for sensuality craving for

148
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:16,260
becoming and craving for non-becoming and those sound a little bit technical but again we can understand from our own

149
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:23,760
life we can feel when we're grasping after things or getting caught up in things or getting obsessed by things or

150
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,940
really wanting something there's a sort of an a grasp a grip associated with

151
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:37,020
that and that's the craving and so the the task of abandoning that or ending it in some way is not so

152
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:42,200
simple but that's um that's the AIM

153
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:47,820
so when we learn something about abandoning these three kinds of craving

154
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:55,740
even temporarily then we can experience the ending or the cessation of Duca of craving so that is

155
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:01,320
the third Noble Truth so the third Noble Truth states that the end of dukkha the

156
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:09,359
cessation of this suffering is the same actually as letting go of the craving we're going to release the cause or the

157
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:16,920
cofactor and that is what's going to help us get through to the end of suffering

158
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,020
so this is the task is to realize to realize the cessation and we'll talk

159
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:30,000
more about this in a moment that will kind of unfold that over today what does it mean to realize the end of suffering

160
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,760
so then the fourth Noble Truth which will come up next week but I just want to give a brief overview along this line

161
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,880
of the tasks is to is the Eightfold Path it's that there is a a path that leads

162
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:50,520
to the cessation of suffering there's a way to get from here to there and that task is to cultivate this path so again

163
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:56,700
it's something that we can start on right away but can also take a whole lifetime to do the Eightfold Path I don't know are you

164
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:02,280
done with the April path yet no no me neither so it's a it's a long one

165
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:08,820
so I found this lovely quote from ajan tsuchito about practice of the Four Noble Truths

166
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:15,480
the practice of the Four Noble Truths does not suggest a process of someone becoming enlightened

167
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,240
it's more that a particular Viewpoint is sustained and understanding arises

168
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:28,440
through it the Viewpoint is a focus upon dukkha in an objective dispassionate way

169
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:35,160
so when the intention is to penetrate the experience of Duca we could also say understand dukkha

170
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:41,520
attention gathers onto that feeling and investigates it this leads to a powerful

171
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:48,540
Insight because it reveals that Duca is structured created and not absolute and

172
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:55,380
therefore possible to be dismantled or not created so that's what we're talking about here

173
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,540
today we're going to look at this third Noble Truth the ending of dukkha

174
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:08,880
but I just want to pause for a moment to acknowledge we've made it to the good news we had duka we had craving you know

175
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:16,140
all these things that are kind of like uh but now we've gotten to the part oh it can end there can be an end to this

176
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:21,839
it's not all about suffering there's Freedom there's peace so we're going to talk a little bit more

177
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:28,020
about that and all start us off and then Tanya's going to have a few things to say also

178
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:34,619
about this third Noble Truth so when you hear this phrase the end of

179
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:41,160
dukkha you might think immediately that you know what that means so surely surely

180
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:47,160
the end of Duca would mean my body stops hurting and is functioning correctly

181
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:52,380
all the people in my life who do things that I don't want them to do will start

182
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:57,599
doing all the things that I want them to do my work will be non-stressful and

183
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:04,380
they'll start doing things the way I think that we ought to do them uh and the world will stop being so

184
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:11,099
insane and cruel and Society will start heading in the direction that's beneficial for all that would be the end

185
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:17,460
of suffering right so do you see a theme Here is it our

186
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:24,300
idea of the end of Duca is mostly about things going as we want them to that

187
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:29,760
would be our idea at some level we really believe this because that's that

188
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:37,020
we really believe maybe that that's even what's required for us to be happy we certainly put enough energy into getting

189
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:44,099
all those things to be true that's why we continually work toward them and it's not a bad wish the wish for health the

190
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:49,619
wish for good relationships for ease for World Peace those are all good things to

191
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:55,140
want um but if we consider that there are

192
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,599
maybe eight billion versions of these things like how the world should be how

193
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:05,640
things should be I don't know is it reasonable that that's going to come about

194
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,800
actually really so

195
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,079
the Buddha did take our wish seriously for happiness and a good life he he

196
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:23,280
wanted us to have that but he essentially took that wish that he knows is in everybody's heart

197
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,980
and he realigned it with something might that might actually be achievable that's

198
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:34,079
the brilliance so by noticing that suffering always comes along with

199
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,839
grasping for example he suggested that we let go of the grasping

200
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:45,060
it's brilliant right if we let go of the grasping then we wouldn't have to Duke

201
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:51,119
up so this um you know this is much more in the realm of what we can influence we

202
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:57,599
don't have exact control but we can at least influence this I'm pretty confident that there's no way to fix all

203
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,960
the other people and conditions in the world those things are really not in my personal control

204
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,000
now just to head off one possible objection that comes up at this point

205
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,940
and you'll talk about this more through the rest of the series that doesn't mean that we just blandly blindly accept

206
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:20,460
everything as it is that wouldn't be happiness either it's more subtle than that

207
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:28,200
so that's what we're starting to explore today so we can try to release in our heart this

208
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:36,119
immediate condition for dukkha this grasping that we have this desperate wanting that we struggle with

209
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:41,400
so we have this task that we're supposed to realize something about the end of suffering

210
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:48,540
so I've noticed that the word realize has two different meanings one is to

211
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:53,579
to recognize to come to understand something like I just realized that the

212
00:43:53,579 --> 00:44:00,180
ceiling in this room is over 20 feet tall you know that would be a reasonable statement I didn't just realize it but

213
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:06,420
one could and then realize can also mean to make

214
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:11,460
real to manifest to actualize to make it real

215
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:16,740
and I would suggest that both of them are meant in this case of freedom from

216
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:22,680
dukkha the end of suffering so we'll start with the first one you

217
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:29,280
know this this interesting that that if we're supposed to realize the cessation of dukkha there's something there that

218
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:36,300
we're supposed to see something that we're supposed to recognize do we actually recognize the end of

219
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:43,440
dukkha that's actually a really interesting question it's quite easy to see the dukkha at least some of it

220
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:50,220
people are very happy to talk about their suffering and it's very rare that somebody can't say something about

221
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:56,160
what's challenging for them but when some instance of suffering ends

222
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:02,819
even a small one we often don't really take that in completely

223
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:08,640
so for example like when a noise is going on and then it ends like a sound

224
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:16,680
that's irritating to us and then it ends we might have a moment where we say finally something like that but then we

225
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,800
rush on to the next thing you know we won't we don't really take in the feeling of

226
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:27,240
ease from increased silence and when we're you know when we're

227
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:33,119
frustrated or rushed the shduka in that but when that resolves we tend to just move on to the next thing we don't

228
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:38,940
really take that in so Tanya's going to talk more about this I won't say more about that she's going to talk more

229
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:45,500
about our tendency not to notice what is useful and to not to really take that in

230
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:52,920
so there are also I mean I talked about some mentions some everyday instances of

231
00:45:52,920 --> 00:46:00,960
something challenging ending there are also ways in which we have really deep releases along the Dharma path and these

232
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:07,859
are easier to notice you know when the mind or the heart really lets go of something but getting to the point where we would

233
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:15,420
have one of those releases take some practice it takes cultivating mindfulness learning about our own body

234
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:22,740
mind system such that we can move toward letting go at some point we'll understand what this

235
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:29,880
Dharma release means it's kind of a non-volitional opening up or a letting go of something that was

236
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:36,359
being grasped we can feel it can really feel the craving and the clinging coming coming to an end so there's something to

237
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:41,819
see there is something to realize in the end of in this third Noble Truth the end

238
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:50,220
of suffering so I tried to think about an example of how how Insight Works in this practice

239
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:55,500
you know how how is it that we're going to experience this

240
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:01,619
end of suffering or end of something and I came up with an example that I don't know if it's going to work or not

241
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:09,060
but check it out um so you guys are so young do you remember these um those old monitors

242
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:14,359
that were called cathode ray tubes CRTs they're like

243
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:21,780
they're like old style televisions they're like boxes so instead of being flat like Tanya's it would be like a

244
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:28,200
whole it would have like some depth to it so anyway all the screens used to be like that and the lot they worked by

245
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:35,700
having electrons firing at a phosphor screen on the front and it made it made the image you don't have to worry about that but the big ones had three

246
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:42,359
different sections to them essentially but you wouldn't know that if you just looked at the screen it looked fine they

247
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:48,500
I mean the technology was great the image looked perfect but if you knew

248
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:55,859
that there were that there were three different sections to the screen if you looked very carefully one third of the

249
00:47:55,859 --> 00:48:00,900
way down and two-thirds of the way down you could see a tiny little black line

250
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:06,599
just tiny I mean you have to know that it was there in order to see it but once

251
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:13,500
you checked out on a screen you really looked and you found those two black lines you couldn't unsee them you know

252
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:19,500
you'd seen them you can't unsee them so you could go back you could relax your eye you could you could enjoy the full

253
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:25,619
image again but anytime you wanted you could find those two little lines on these old style screens

254
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:32,280
so my my theory is that cessation is like this so you have to know what to look

255
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:37,859
for and then you have to really look Dharma practice does take considerable

256
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:44,280
sustained effort as you're already finding from practicing meditation but if you keep looking there will come a

257
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:50,280
moment where you can see a gap you can see a little Gap in experience

258
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:58,140
and once you've seen something like that you can't unsee it so there's a way in which if this Gap

259
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:04,800
that you see which I'm calling cessation if it's deep enough and complete enough it will bring

260
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:12,300
genuine relief from suffering every time you look at the image you you have a sense of that underlying piece that

261
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:18,180
could be there that's kind of how Insight works so you'll something that you'll know for

262
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:25,800
yourself so you look and look and finally you see it and when you see something that you know you won't be able to unsee that is

263
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:32,060
a Dharma insight Richard's laughing because he remembers CRTs

264
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:40,740
so anyway so um then we get on to the second definition of realize right to make real make it real yeah make it

265
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:46,200
happen manifest it in some way so Awakening is not just some kind of big

266
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:51,980
bang experience that instantly changes everything well it could be but it's very rare

267
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:57,960
instead more likely we have to work at it kind of gradually setting up the

268
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:04,020
conditions for the mind and the heart to let go um and there are many descriptions of

269
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:11,280
how this process goes you know some from the sutas some the the original teachings of the Buddha some from more

270
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:17,099
modern teachers you'll hear next week about the Eightfold Path which is the main method that the Buddha taught the

271
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:24,180
main path that he taught but I want to name very briefly a description that I heard from a modern

272
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:29,520
teacher named Martine Bachelor and I'm I'm sort of going to paraphrase and

273
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:36,599
summarize it a bit but she talks about how we tend to let go of Habitual mental

274
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:41,640
patterns of dukkha that's the phrase I'm using habitual mental patterns of Duca

275
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:47,940
and so these are things that you would know examples are things like maybe we have a habit of interrupting

276
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:55,859
people and we frequently you know we frequently do that or we have a habit of social fear we we get anxious when we're

277
00:50:55,859 --> 00:51:01,079
in big groups or we have a habit of getting angry easily and snapping at at

278
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:09,000
people when we tend to fly off the rails pretty quickly so there are four stages of how we might

279
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,420
let go of these patterns which brings suffering those are Duco patterns these are unpleasant patterns

280
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:21,000
so the first stage which we can be in effortlessly is that we blindly do the

281
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,700
pattern we have no clue that it's happening we're completely ignorant that we are constantly interrupting people

282
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:33,300
for example ignorance is not Bliss in this practice ignorance is not Bliss

283
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:39,960
so we do what we're doing our mindfulness practice we do meditation and suddenly we realize oh we see that

284
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:46,859
we have a certain pattern yay this is better than not seeing but we tend to

285
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:52,740
see it at first we tend to see it afterward you know like we realize oh my gosh I

286
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:58,800
I interrupted my friend 14 times in that conversation that we just had coffee you're driving home while you're

287
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:06,420
realizing this and so you know you didn't notice it in the moment um but uh so that's the second step but

288
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:12,599
then the third is that you catch it in the middle you know you realize that you're about to interrupt but you're

289
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:17,640
you're not fast enough to catch it and you do and so it's like look so you

290
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:23,579
watch yourself playing out this pattern or and this is a very painful stage and

291
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:28,920
you start thinking why did I start mindfulness practice I didn't want to know all this about how my mind works

292
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:36,359
but you're actually getting closer and closer to the moment right you're noticing it sooner and sooner and then

293
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:43,220
there's This Magic Moment where you feel yourself of wanting to interrupt and you don't

294
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:49,500
you choose some other path I'm just using the example of interrupting but you know substitute

295
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:56,880
your mental pattern and you might get caught again the next time you might forget but once you've cut through that

296
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:03,720
first time you were strong enough that first time that pattern is on the way out it might take another 10 000 times

297
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,760
of seeing it but nonetheless in a sense you were free in that moment

298
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:15,359
the pattern didn't overwhelm your mind so these are the stages that we go through it's sort of a small

299
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:22,260
everyday version of how the cessation of Duco works we very gradually

300
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:28,440
find that we can let go of a pattern it doesn't hold us anymore and we realize

301
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,900
you know the craving that went with I got to get my word in right now

302
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:41,640
that's gone and so the Duco of that pattern is gone also and these little everyday versions set us up to

303
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:48,599
understand the bigger releases that the Buddha was pointing to in his Dharma teachings about how we can free the

304
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:56,280
heart from really really deep attachments that we have so keep at it keep looking for the gaps

305
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:03,059
and little little releases looking for the patterns and just keep aiming to manifest

306
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:08,339
behavior that is somehow free of craving and clinging and that is the path toward

307
00:54:08,339 --> 00:54:15,260
more and more freedom and I would love to pass it on to you

308
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:25,920
maybe before before I say anything I just want to give you guys a chance to if you have a question for Kim anything

309
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,920
that you would like her to clarify or restate

310
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:41,720
you don't have to of course just an opportunity

311
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,040
great

312
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:55,619
uh yeah sure I could ask something um so the the clean I think you had mentioned

313
00:54:55,619 --> 00:55:02,040
uh the oh is it craving I think that's the word that's coming to my mind so what

314
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:08,819
manifests to go backwards what manifests the craving or where do these come from it almost seems like they

315
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:15,119
might be sort of ingrained or reinforced or oh great question yeah so you're very

316
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:21,059
in degrees and that's such a wonderful question I want to just acknowledge that this is

317
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:27,480
actually how the Buddha investigated also he kept looking back you know he's like okay they're suffering why is there

318
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:34,260
suffering and eventually figured out oh it's because of craving or clinging and he did keep asking that question so

319
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:39,480
um in the kind of classical teachings the Buddha would Point toward reactivity

320
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:45,900
to things that are coming into our sense doors so we see things and react to them

321
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:51,059
we hear things and react to them we're mostly reacting to kind of the impact

322
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:56,579
that they make on us and these this is very habitual stuff that we've conditioned and built up over our life

323
00:55:56,579 --> 00:56:02,160
is that certain sight sound smells tastes touches and thoughts irritate us

324
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:08,040
or excite us or scare us and that reaction is where the craving comes from

325
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:14,819
because then we say I got to get more of that because I like it or this is irritating or painful to me I've

326
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:22,260
got to push it away and that's the seed for or grasping pushing away clinging wanting

327
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:29,400
reacting Etc and if you trace that back farther how did that happen well has to do with

328
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:35,640
even deeper tendencies in the mind to how our basically how our nervous system was conditioned

329
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:41,760
Tanya may want to add to that not right now but that was great yeah

330
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:47,520
yeah okay you wanted to

331
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:54,420
yeah I am sorry yeah I

332
00:56:54,420 --> 00:57:03,078
feel like I'm having a hard time um understanding like

333
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,460
because you were talking about how like ignorance is is not Bliss and being

334
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:19,319
aware of like patterns and just yeah you know things that are

335
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:26,119
socially conditioned and all this stuff is is it's a good thing which

336
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:31,859
I know it is but then sometimes it's hard to

337
00:57:31,859 --> 00:57:37,619
especially when it's something that is out of your control like other people's

338
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:43,859
um beliefs or values or just I'm you know anything that's out of your own control

339
00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:49,500
then there's this feeling of like well now I know that this exists and it's

340
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:54,960
hurting me in some way but then it's also out of my control

341
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:01,619
and maybe I was better off just not knowing it existed

342
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:07,800
um I don't know if I'm freezing this well but I guess it's

343
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:13,040
hard for me to understand like how

344
00:58:14,339 --> 00:58:21,180
to um let go of or like not do anything about

345
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:27,619
something that is now like in your awareness and you can't

346
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:33,780
it's out of your control yeah you want me you want to do that I want

347
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:38,880
me to I'll offer something and I have the feeling you might too um

348
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:44,099
I guess I would say that there isn't ever really anything that's completely

349
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:51,240
um like the ignorance part if you just didn't know about it doesn't mean it's not influencing your life and

350
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:57,119
your behavior it's actually subterranean so it's still if you have some pattern

351
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:02,460
that you don't know about it is driving your behavior and it is leading to Duca

352
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:08,339
and the only way to end it is to know it and then release it according to these

353
00:59:08,339 --> 00:59:14,839
teachings so there isn't really um there isn't really you know out of the picture

354
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:19,920
kinds of things like that go ahead

355
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:26,640
so I'm gonna see if I address what I think something I think

356
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:32,579
of when you share so let's let me think you know it could be sexism

357
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:38,819
um so I become aware that I'm around a

358
00:59:38,819 --> 00:59:45,000
bunch of people and they have um really fixed ideas about what women

359
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,700
are and aren't capable of what they are and aren't for where

360
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:57,480
they're good where they're not and it doesn't fit with my own experience of myself or how I want to be

361
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:03,480
seen so when I become aware of that

362
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:10,980
um it there's a whole phase of it being extremely painful I might be angry

363
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:17,660
hurt I have to go through a whole process right of starting to see it

364
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:23,640
recognizing it and I think that this practice one of

365
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:30,599
the things that it can teach us is that over time we actually can be in the presence of sexism

366
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:36,599
and get free of our own habits of internalizing the sexism

367
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:42,059
of reinforcing or automatically reacting to the sexism

368
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:47,880
that we can focus on recognizing the pattern and our

369
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:56,579
pattern of reacting to it and and that um as we get better at not reacting we

370
01:00:56,579 --> 01:01:02,280
actually are probably going to get better at dismantling reconstructing our relationships or

371
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:09,720
creating other spaces and things like that but there's there's two parts there's the pattern of sexism and then

372
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:18,059
there's the pattern of our internal response to the sexism and both need to be addressed but we

373
01:01:18,059 --> 01:01:25,200
often are more effective at addressing the outer pattern after we've worked on our our own

374
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:31,200
relationship to it and sometimes we stop going to a place because there's too

375
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:38,339
much sexism and we can't exist in it without wilting

376
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:46,859
or enraging right um so to me there's two two parts to look

377
01:01:46,859 --> 01:01:52,079
at here and in the practice and for me this looking

378
01:01:52,079 --> 01:02:00,960
at my own response to the source of my suffering is incredibly incred like

379
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:07,500
there's so much Freedom that can be found when I shift my relationship and see the

380
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:11,780
sexism as for what it is

381
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:19,260
I'll stop there it looks like you had a question or wanted to say something yeah this might be kind of basic question but

382
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:24,359
it's good around reactivity in general yeah and

383
01:02:24,359 --> 01:02:31,140
um I am I I definitely am very reactive in

384
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:40,020
situations like that um foreign and I guess does being non-reactive mean

385
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:45,599
kind of having an attitude of like Live and Let Live Like or is it like in the

386
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:52,799
moment you're not reactive and then you kind of like take time to figure out how to react the right way yeah so

387
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:59,640
um for me if I stay with this example it would be the reactivity I'm going to

388
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:07,680
talk about for myself my internal would be that I don't feel shame anymore that that's my own internal I cling to

389
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:14,640
the idea of sexism I get caught up in the idea that I'm less than

390
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:21,799
I believe it on some level and then I feel like I'm less than I feel shame

391
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:27,960
that's my own duka pattern and I'm relating to the becoming or not wanting

392
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:33,839
to become of this image right and

393
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:42,299
when I'm free from my own response to that external idea

394
01:03:42,299 --> 01:03:48,780
I don't get I don't feel shame anymore I actually feel completely fine

395
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:55,640
I see that somebody is seeing me with delusion

396
01:03:56,220 --> 01:04:03,119
and so I feel like I don't have to I get to choose what I want to do I get to

397
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:10,619
choose like freely how I want to respond if I want to

398
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:18,240
respond I get to like I I have the capacity

399
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:24,359
in my reactivity and my shame I don't have the same capacity I'm struggling

400
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:29,880
internally with my own oppression internalized oppression

401
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:36,059
which causes you know it creates it activates the threat system it's hard to

402
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:43,200
think hard to speak hard to stand upright hard to look at somebody in the eye all of these things are happening

403
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:48,839
when I have internal reactivity when I see through that

404
01:04:48,839 --> 01:04:55,380
there's no internal reactivity it's if there's a solidity of you know a clear

405
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:01,920
Clarity a freedom I don't I am not determined who I am

406
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:07,440
what I am isn't affected internally by how they see me they may still see me

407
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:14,760
the way they have it yeah that's super helpful thank you yeah

408
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:20,520
and I think um so one of my things that I think is

409
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:25,559
really helpful too to help us see this a lot that when I'm working

410
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:32,640
with people on areas where they're feeling duka a lot of times

411
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:37,740
we stay looking at what we don't want or what we want

412
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:44,700
so there's the sexism and then there's our response to the

413
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:50,280
sexism and the response is duka we'll call it duka right if we're having

414
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:55,760
reactivity and one of the ways that I help myself

415
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:03,540
get disenchanted with my reactivity actually is to understand

416
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:09,319
and be able to move my awareness between this is sexism

417
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:15,000
and this is the cluster of all the things it means and then this is what it

418
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,520
feels like in me when I'm reacting to the existence of suffering and taking it

419
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:26,400
personally does that make sense and that's the feeling that's the dukkha that's the

420
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:32,220
like the stress the pain so one of the things that really helps

421
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:37,619
me kind of disentangle all of this is to separate out

422
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:42,660
what the object is from what the experience of Duke is

423
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:48,539
because if I keep looking over here the Mind keeps getting caught up in all the stories about how this should not be

424
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:55,500
happening how wrong it is how oppressive it is and so it's hard to stay and let the

425
01:06:55,500 --> 01:07:01,140
dukkah teach me like we learn that it hurts if we push

426
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:08,400
too hard on our pen or touch a hot stove we learn right well we we're gonna learn

427
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:14,039
from what we're clinging our clinging by noticing the dukkha is that making am I

428
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:21,000
clear am I staying like very clear okay so that's one thing that can be helpful

429
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:28,920
so for you like when you're if you if you imagine if you're struggling with sexism how do you shift your awareness

430
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:35,160
from external to internal the manifestation of sexism and then

431
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:41,099
your response reactivity to the sexism and then the reactivity you have to be

432
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:46,859
careful with when you pay attention to it because it can be like well that's wrong well yes it is wrong and then

433
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:54,420
there's this engagement with the thoughts around the sexism but don't miss that there's a feeling

434
01:07:54,420 --> 01:08:02,640
right the dukkah in there when we're reacting instead of clearly just seeing

435
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:10,380
um and not getting caught up in identification yeah you guys following me oh yeah I

436
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:16,318
follow okay I was wondering if I could chime in a little bit on my own experience sometimes with reactivity I

437
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:21,679
found that I've um when I do respond I put my foot on my mouth and I've learned that it's a skill to respond

438
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:27,980
appropriately or accordingly um my own experience yeah

439
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:33,960
okay feeling good right there right okay

440
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:39,600
so let's see where are my for time uh

441
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:44,758
okay thanks Kim um

442
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:51,120
so so I wanted to name that anyway about kind of it one some of the things that

443
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:57,660
can kind of get in the way of our noticing the ending of suffering is because we we're we're still clinging

444
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:05,520
and we're not we're looking we're not looking at the right things or we're kind of still in reactivity so

445
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:10,738
in the first class I talked about Duca as like the experience can be thought of

446
01:09:10,739 --> 01:09:18,000
like as a compass like noticing and tuning into the existence or absence of

447
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:25,258
dukha is is like referencing a compass when there is dukkha you can sort of

448
01:09:25,259 --> 01:09:31,500
imagine the needle is pointing toward more suffering if we keep going this way

449
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:36,900
and when there's an absence of dukkha it's like okay oh you know I'm going

450
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:42,060
it's okay like I'm I'm moving in the right direction I'm Letting Go I'm

451
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:49,500
stepping in the present moment in a way that is present but when we're going through our life we

452
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:54,540
have to remember to check the compass just like if we're going on a trip we have to keep paying attention to the

453
01:09:54,540 --> 01:10:02,100
street signs or if we're hiking we need to keep noticing what direction we're going in and it's very easy to forget to

454
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:08,400
check and get caught up in driving like missing your exit on a freeway

455
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:14,520
so one of the things that's really helpful is to keep checking in noticing how am I feeling now

456
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:19,920
what am I aware of now and when you notice that there's ease and well-being

457
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:27,840
oh pause like take it in because the mind has this Kim was

458
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:36,300
referencing this earlier this negativity bias the mind is you know programmed to pay

459
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:42,000
attention to potential threats now that's how we survived so species it

460
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,760
was really important not so important now in the same ways

461
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,800
it's connected to a literal life and death survival system and now it's much

462
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:58,199
more about all kinds of ridiculous little silly things

463
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:03,239
so in order to balance our attention so

464
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:10,140
that we're tuning into the ends of suffering or to the moments of well-being we need to be noticing

465
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:15,659
checking in and then you'll notice that your mind

466
01:11:15,659 --> 01:11:21,780
gets bored really quickly it's like it it is really just like oh

467
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:27,120
yeah okay next and you sometimes you'll be talking to somebody and you'll see them do that

468
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:33,179
you'll go oh look you're doing better you know that's good that that part got better and then you'll they'll come back

469
01:11:33,179 --> 01:11:40,440
with you to you immediately yeah but this and this and that might happen you'll see it around you all the time

470
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:46,440
you know things are going well in your your art project or in your work or in

471
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:53,280
your writing and then if you stop and you reflect on it or something the mind's going to be so quick to start to

472
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:58,920
predict something negative right a criticism or it could be better or I

473
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:03,620
should do more so

474
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:11,640
like those moments of Letting Go those moments of oh it's okay

475
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:19,320
it's like ah Breathe Right There like can you expand into it open into it

476
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:24,719
breathe into it like the idea of savoring

477
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:29,880
and this is in Neuroscience this is exactly what they tell you to do that

478
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:35,820
shows your brain changing is this idea of savoring

479
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:41,400
so just like you might Savor a nice piece of chocolate or some other

480
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:46,980
wonderful thing a sip of water whatever just that feeling of letting it it's

481
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:54,780
like letting the whole body take it in and it requires really a pausing a

482
01:12:54,780 --> 01:13:01,080
staying with and then noticing the impact so not just

483
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:07,199
staying but then tuning in like feeling letting your body sort of

484
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:14,780
ride the feeling the impact because when we do stop and notice a moment of ease

485
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:24,500
there can be a quieting a resting that starts to happen

486
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:31,460
and we want to rush to fill the space

487
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:37,320
and this is about you know this third Noble Truth is about receiving the space

488
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:43,140
it's like a gift receiving the gift being willing to receive

489
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:52,100
some of us aren't so comfortable receiving gifts right so we have to practice that too

490
01:13:52,620 --> 01:14:01,380
another thing that can be helpful for us is to start just tracking endings

491
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:07,560
little endings of things just start to help the Mind tune in because it's that

492
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:14,400
leaping forward thing it's always kind of anticipating so you can start to reorient the Mind

493
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:20,280
toward the ending of things and feel into the ending of things and that sets

494
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:26,640
the mind up also to be more open to and interested and curious about even

495
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:31,800
sort of those moments of ease or things ending and settling

496
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:38,400
in my work with people in addiction they'll talk about having cravings and

497
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:44,520
they can talk about having the feeling that it's like they think they're having a craving all day long every day that's

498
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:50,820
how it sort of ends up for them so I asked them to time their cravings

499
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:55,980
to literally pay attention to when they end and write it down

500
01:14:55,980 --> 01:15:03,420
and and they start to go oh there actually are many moments I'm not having these cravings

501
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:08,940
but they all they could focus on was the moments they did have them

502
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:15,300
so we start to retrain our mind to be more oriented and interested

503
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:20,460
and this these little moments pockets of letting go

504
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:25,500
of not being caught up and wanting or not wanting

505
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,980
something

506
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:38,820
so that feels like a pause I'll just you know let's see if there's other thoughts Kim if you

507
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:43,040
want to add anything you guys have any questions

508
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:54,120
no it's so clear foreign

509
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:04,860
what is it I guess I'll just ask this question what does it feel like when you have a moment of letting go

510
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:08,119
do you know what it feels like

511
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:19,860
um I guess for me to repeat a phrase I'm cautiously optimistic um I I'll notice that I'd let it go and

512
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:25,320
then either emotionally or just sort of logically like well something will come up you know either the next man or next

513
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:31,080
day but it is nice to have that sort of um that a breath of fresh air and just

514
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:37,640
uh enjoy it for the moment yeah but what I'm hearing is

515
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:47,460
is knowing it's going to pass makes it almost something we want to dismiss there can be a habit of that or I can't

516
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:56,400
trust it so we start to protect ourselves from it a little bit and so it can be useful to lean into the

517
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:03,239
those moments a little well I don't know what's it like okay let me hang out with this though right now

518
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:10,699
but it really does take some it's like um leaning into

519
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:19,020
we really kind of do have to lean into it yes okay breathe and hold our our eyes

520
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:25,380
are gonna Dart away crazy the mind the eyes the body will start to

521
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:30,900
impulsively move on so it's it's a it's a conscious thing to

522
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:38,280
sort of help us learn how help the nervous system really learn how to just okay well what does it

523
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:43,440
feel like then if I just enjoy this for the moment I know yeah it's gonna pass

524
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:48,980
and how nourishing is it when you take it in

525
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:58,500
you want to say anything um I was gonna say um I definitely

526
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:04,980
understood and related to what you're talking about about like when one thing passes you immediately go like oh well I

527
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:10,199
have like 30 other things to worry about so it doesn't matter

528
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:16,500
um so I'm definitely going to try to lean into those moments where it's like oh I'm not worrying about this as much

529
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:22,620
and something I do um that was recommended to me is like if

530
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:27,840
I'm having like a very anxious thought or something I'm stressed out about I like type it out on my notes up

531
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:34,140
and then maybe I'll look at it like a week later and be like uh I don't really

532
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:40,920
care about this anymore and I'll like delete it um but I don't think I'm like fully

533
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:46,440
appreciating deleting that text and being like

534
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:53,340
yeah I have gotten past this and maybe this was some like future scenario I was stressing out about but now I feel like

535
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:58,620
it's not that important and it's not gonna have the biggest impact and so I can let

536
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:05,100
it go um I think that's huge to stop with that

537
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:12,000
moment and I just take reflect back on how different the Mind feels

538
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:18,659
with that thought now how it changed it's like oh my God I was gripped

539
01:19:18,659 --> 01:19:26,100
and now I don't even it's like meaningless to me like there's such a profound shift and to let yourself

540
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:33,179
really get disenchanted really feel the ex impact of disenchantment with that

541
01:19:33,179 --> 01:19:40,880
thought a lack of clinging around it is huge huge

542
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:53,280
this is such a great this is such a great place on the path really such a great practice to start to

543
01:19:53,280 --> 01:20:00,060
be like as interested in the moments of Freedom as we are in

544
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:07,260
you know the Duke of which we it's really really helpful companion actually

545
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:13,940
but the ease don't miss it it's like so precious

546
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:27,480
I am I'm remembering it just came this anecdote came to mind just while we were

547
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:34,739
talking about how hard it is sometimes to trust or even recognize ease or in

548
01:20:34,739 --> 01:20:39,920
Tranquility or calmness or freedom

549
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:46,860
just maybe as a comparison so that you'll realize that this mindfulness practice really gives us a gift of being

550
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:52,560
able to be with it this is a long time ago maybe over 15 years ago I was

551
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:58,860
teaching a Qigong class and I had a number of people it was a beginner class

552
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:04,260
and we did a certain we did some standing

553
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:09,540
meditation and some simple moves and you know Qigong is very much about balancing

554
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:16,800
and calming the energies of the body and by the end of the class like most people were feeling like you know really stable

555
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,980
and amazed that their bodies had these alive sort of alive but calm feeling

556
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:28,380
except for this one woman who was got really agitated and she came up to me at

557
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:35,699
the end of class and said do you teach this class at a different time ever and I said well I no not

558
01:21:35,699 --> 01:21:41,940
really but you know it's like I didn't know what she was asking and it took me a while of like asking her is that she

559
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:48,420
had felt calm she had actually gotten calm like everybody else and had freaked out because of it she had never felt

560
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:55,440
Tranquility she had never felt calm and it was like she thought she was falling asleep she thought she was fainting she

561
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:00,659
thought it was because it was dinner time and she hadn't had enough food you know it's like she could she could land

562
01:22:00,659 --> 01:22:05,820
she could not land on this experience of actually of having just calmed down

563
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:12,900
because of this practice she didn't have mindfulness you know she didn't know that and so I think you know

564
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:18,780
I was quite naive at that time and I I didn't quite realize that some people

565
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:27,179
really have a difficult time touching this that really woke me up to how hard it can be to have this experience so

566
01:22:27,179 --> 01:22:33,000
I feel like both of you are already there really in terms of being able to

567
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,280
see this and just yeah just encouragement to continue with the

568
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:44,580
um the sense of presence of calm of openness for exactly the reasons that

569
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:50,940
Tanya said is that those that gives us the freedom of choice about what we want to do it doesn't mean that we're just

570
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:56,699
going to become passive or not care or just say whatever however the world is

571
01:22:56,699 --> 01:23:03,840
is fine maybe it isn't but we can we'll be able to act much more freely much

572
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:10,699
more effectively and compassionately from a place of freedom in our own heart

573
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:19,560
another um practice place can be actually when

574
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:25,560
you're meditating and you you know there's something called Bell mind right where you can

575
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:31,620
start to get very fixated and when the bell's gonna bring and which is a form of clinging right

576
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:37,260
you're like grasping on to the end of the the bell and

577
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:44,699
you'll go people will go through a phase often where as soon as the bell rings they're like oh you know they're just

578
01:23:44,699 --> 01:23:51,060
they're done they're like gone already and so it can be really powerful to

579
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:59,640
start to say okay I know there's I'm anticipating I'm anxious but I'm not going to break my posture right away

580
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:05,760
I'm gonna stay for a moment with being with this meditation beyond the

581
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:11,820
bell and just like notice just notice what that feels like

582
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:17,159
and the pressure you can start to re see how the pressure that builds up will

583
01:24:17,159 --> 01:24:23,400
just start to dissipate because we've been practicing clinging to getting to the end and then we start

584
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:29,219
to practice not clinging and it changes and there starts to be greater capacity

585
01:24:29,219 --> 01:24:36,000
to just to rest to be with and to be more at ease during the whole meditation

586
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,640
eventually you know or on and off yeah

587
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:49,440
so so this is actually something you can practice you can choose places and time like um

588
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:56,280
I've done it when I'm driving when I stop signs like there's the Habit to to

589
01:24:56,280 --> 01:25:02,280
want to hurry and to practice pausing

590
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:07,440
right and then oh you can feel the absence right there right there's just

591
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:13,380
like oh it's kind of nice not to just be driven by the clinging that this

592
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:17,420
grasping this energy of chasing

593
01:25:18,659 --> 01:25:24,080
so small little ways can help you start to tune into it

594
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:35,040
so the Buddha's claim was that you can reach the end of all dukkha

595
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:40,739
and experience life with no stickiness no clinging no craving

596
01:25:40,739 --> 01:25:46,860
he called this nibana which literally means going out you know like a flame

597
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:52,260
all the flame of our craving and grasping if you imagine that as a fire

598
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:58,440
it's like just go out what do you think what do you think of that does it sound

599
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:05,460
possible does it sound inspiring impossible never thought about it before it's a

600
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:12,780
pretty like um if I can use I don't know if this word's allowed anymore it's like a pretty ballsy claim don't you think

601
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:15,920
what do you think of this

602
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:29,219
I don't know when I when you said that I was like that seems possible for like

603
01:26:29,219 --> 01:26:36,600
people who are like deep into this kind of practice and maybe even like

604
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:41,940
have let go of all um

605
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:48,360
you know like material I don't know I don't know it's just yeah it sounds like just

606
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:54,800
Way Beyond what I could imagine happening for me

607
01:26:56,100 --> 01:27:02,940
I think in theory it makes sense um it takes me back to like some of my philosophy classes that I had to take

608
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:10,920
and whatnot but um I don't think I'm anywhere near that uh capability

609
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:16,139
um yeah that's interesting I just wanted to ask

610
01:27:16,139 --> 01:27:22,739
because sometimes we don't really come up against we don't really think about what the Buddha was really saying and

611
01:27:22,739 --> 01:27:29,820
actually I noticed that both of you said it seems possible actually you might be interested to know that there are

612
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:36,239
um groups or uh sometimes Buddhist groups or strands of Buddhism get into

613
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:42,179
the idea that it's been too long since the historical Buddha and Awakening is no longer possible

614
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:48,360
so I see you don't you're not affected by that that's nice it doesn't mean we can we we should think oh tomorrow is

615
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:53,400
probably going to happen for me you know sure it's a big process but I love that

616
01:27:53,400 --> 01:28:00,080
you both thought it was you know potential that's actually really big

617
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:08,760
do you feel I'm curious um do you have a better sense of what it might be like to be without craving that

618
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:14,400
it doesn't mean that you don't care it doesn't mean you give in to everything it doesn't mean that you don't do

619
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:21,139
anything but can you feel more into the sense of Freedom that might be there

620
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:29,400
I think I have a sense a new sense that um it will be okay

621
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:34,679
um whatever happens you know small problem big problem or a big win small

622
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:39,900
win tomorrow will be another day and another workable another page and it'll

623
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:45,900
be okay um then to to what degree or what skill level you're able to uh to roll with the

624
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:51,179
punches or to have a positive outlook um I think probably that's where I'm at

625
01:28:51,179 --> 01:28:54,679
right now is uh it'll be okay

626
01:28:56,639 --> 01:29:01,860
um I feel like to be honest I haven't given a lot of

627
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:07,080
thought to like my daily actions and like how much it relates to clinging

628
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:12,719
which is probably something I'll do now but um like even just sitting here I'm

629
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:19,320
thinking about like all the stuff I constantly tell myself or that's told to

630
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:25,560
me like for example like a few years ago like I don't know I was like oh but this

631
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:32,460
I know a lot of people do this but they're like oh by this age I'm gonna achieve these things and then when I hit this age I'm gonna get married when I

632
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:37,739
hit this patient and it's like I mean I'm obviously not on track for

633
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:44,100
any of that stuff that I decided for myself when I was like 18 or something but

634
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:49,980
um it now makes me think like oh I was kind of clinging to this idea of like

635
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:56,520
things having to happen at a certain time and stuff like that and I just feel like there's probably so

636
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:01,980
many areas in my life that I am doing that and

637
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:08,520
probably needs more thought and recognition

638
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:15,000
well take one of those examples that you clearly have kind of done some

639
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,040
work around letting go and how did it feel to not be so caught

640
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:27,540
up in that idea was was it was there anything good about going ah I don't actually have to do

641
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:34,800
that um I don't know if I fully gotten past it I think I still have moments of like

642
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:41,040
when I see other people doing certain things or achieving certain things in certain timelines I'm like maybe I'm

643
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:46,080
behind and maybe I'm failing at life and you know

644
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:52,320
um but sometimes I do have moments of being like uh who cares like if it

645
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:57,659
happens for me now or in 10 years I don't know if it's gonna make that big of a difference and

646
01:30:57,659 --> 01:31:03,120
it definitely helps with the stress and anxiety and just

647
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:08,600
um being okay with that stuff yeah

648
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:32,639
well I'm thinking about how um when you each said yeah that seems

649
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:40,920
possible but I don't know about for me that's such a perfect setup for next week when because the the fourth Noble

650
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:46,560
Truth is there's a path and essentially says there's a path from here to there

651
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:51,840
and because our first thought when we hear that their Noble Truth can be yeah

652
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:59,880
right maybe for some people or maybe theoretically philosophically but

653
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:06,179
you know the Buddha was also clear that you know there is yeah there's a way

654
01:32:06,179 --> 01:32:12,780
there is a way to get from here to there it's not just an ideal so that's I find the fourth truth

655
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:19,100
actually one of the most inspiring the third is good it's quite good but

656
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:25,698
the fourth makes it real in a sense it's like how you actually do make it real

657
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:37,380
it does involve change of life some way certainly a change of what we're how

658
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:41,420
we're seeing things but yeah

659
01:32:57,719 --> 01:33:04,860
final questions before we do dedication of Merit or comments reflections

660
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,300
thank you

661
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:30,840
I think recently with the the pandemic and seeing the fragility of life it's probably given me a new perspective on

662
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:37,739
what's important and what's you know not important um I I kind of wrestle with them letting

663
01:33:37,739 --> 01:33:46,500
go of the clinging because I think well some of these intricacies make me who I am and and um it kind of um what

664
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:52,560
evolution do I want to sort of fine tune and and you know what things

665
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:58,440
do I want to sort of keep of myself um but it is a it is kind of a an

666
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:04,080
interesting topic to sort of see how environment and time around me has made

667
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:07,460
me have a new perspective on things

668
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:15,239
what you started out saying with the pandemic has highlighted for you what's

669
01:34:15,239 --> 01:34:21,900
important it's it's said that there are these Heavenly messengers of um it's kind of a

670
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:27,060
funny word but of Aging illness and death and at some point I mean these are

671
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:34,560
things that are real for humans and at some point we wake up to them because they come to us but if we're more wise

672
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:39,900
we can even see them in others or see them outside in society and be inspired

673
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:45,300
by them it's like yeah these things are real and and therefore what is important

674
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:52,800
to me how do I want to live how do I want to manifest and then the other questions of

675
01:34:52,800 --> 01:35:00,719
is this working for me is this aligned with how I see my own spirituality and that's

676
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:07,139
something that we discern as we actually engage with the practices I wouldn't worry too much about whether

677
01:35:07,139 --> 01:35:12,540
certain aspects of yourself are going to change or stay the same the Dharma

678
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:18,420
the Dharma takes all the best stuff that's useful and just enhances it to

679
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:24,920
help eliminate the parts of you that are clinging it'll work

680
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:36,719
I was just gonna say that I feel like this session was kind of timely for me and

681
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:43,679
this idea of like or I guess I've just been like reflecting a lot on

682
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:48,840
my reaction to things and like why I react that way and

683
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:55,020
it's kind of like coming full circle with like maybe I'm clinging to something and

684
01:35:55,020 --> 01:36:02,040
um I can also see how that reaction affects

685
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:07,920
um how I relate to others and um

686
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:14,880
yeah it's just something that I I think is it this is helpful to

687
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:19,980
um explore that more it's great well it's been it's so nice

688
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:26,880
to have you both here it's just so wonderful to have you both so engaged it's

689
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:33,719
wonderful so I'm glad you're feeling it's good timing yeah

690
01:36:33,719 --> 01:36:39,360
so the let's do our dedication of Merit and um you know the idea is to share the

691
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:45,179
benefit of our practice and with the theme of this third Noble Truth the end

692
01:36:45,179 --> 01:36:50,280
of suffering are there any beings that you would like

693
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:55,500
to think of to bring to mind that we would like to wish

694
01:36:55,500 --> 01:37:01,460
have the experience of suffering ending anyone you want to name

695
01:37:16,139 --> 01:37:22,020
eternally absolutely no pressure just give him space so may all beings

696
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:29,179
everywhere without exception experience the end of suffering

697
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:39,198
[Music]

698
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:51,619
thank you
