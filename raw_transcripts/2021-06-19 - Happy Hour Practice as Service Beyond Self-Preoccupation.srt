1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,399
okay great so welcome warm welcome to all of you

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:12,000
for this friday's edition of happy hour

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,200
so for today's theme of our practice um

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,000
[Music] i'd like to invite us to consider it's a

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,560
merging of different of a couple of different themes and ideas and one is

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,840
um an antidote an anti as an antidote you know meta has been

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,120
taught also can serve as an antidote to self-criticism

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,079
to self-judgment to the self-judgmental thought coming up you're terrible you're awful you're a

9
00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:00,640
failure you haven't accomplished anything in your life you know you're not going anywhere just the most horrible terrible things

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,439
that we wouldn't tell anyone but oh it just comes up and just gets unleashed and it can be very

11
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:14,799
painful and not for everyone not all the time but it can come up now and then and and

12
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:22,000
it um tends to be more prevalent somehow in the west because we measure us ourselves so much

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,040
according to these external standards of that the media holds up power and money

14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,159
and use and beauty and and can cause a lot of

15
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:41,360
suffering so so with that and again you may not identify with this

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,240
right now and so you are welcome to file this teaching on and um uh

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,479
for a later user there might be some other areas that this can actually be helpful as this can be

18
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,399
supportive so so a meta loving kindness and practices of

19
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:07,439
the heart in general there are many ways many ways to really shake us shake ourselves out of

20
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,480
the prison this make fabricated this made-up fabricated prison

21
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,080
of comparison and self-judgment because maybe you have a memory of you know a

22
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,920
moment or if you've had the storm of self-judgements of comparison

23
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,520
a moment one moment you're fine it's like you're going about your business and the next moment it just comes on

24
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,360
and then this fabrication gets created and then sadness and depression

25
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:44,319
self-recrimination so so how to one way one way to shake ourselves out of there

26
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,640
are many many practices one practice i'd like to offer for us to to explore

27
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,720
is is um in a way taking ourselves out of it

28
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,200
because the self criticism self recombination self self self it all has to do with the

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:11,120
self me me me me i'm terrible i'm great i'm awful i'm fantastic i'm i i are right

30
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,239
so what if we just take the self out of it in a very healthy way

31
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,720
really turn this whole paradigm on its head and one question

32
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:30,400
one come one question one way we can explore this is how may i be of service

33
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:38,480
how may this being be of service how can i serve so in a way with that question

34
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,319
it's intended to not see us as getting wanting i want this i'm not

35
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,640
getting that is oh how can this being that is me with all the connections in the world with

36
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,799
all the personal connections with all the relationships with all the skills

37
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,680
how can i show up in the way to serve to serve the world so it's not about me getting it's me about me ah

38
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,239
how can i offer how can i offer how can i how can i let my heart my body my

39
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,680
resources be a gift unto others and

40
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,720
this can be this can be a radical way to shift ourselves out of this

41
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,120
this me i'm not good enough i want this it just completely changes the frame it changes

42
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,080
the frame and along these lines of how may i serve

43
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,320
how can i be of service and it can be simple it can be very simple we're not talking

44
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,840
about grand um you know could be grand right you could you could change the

45
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,759
the direction of your life but it could also be in very subtle ways oh with you know this person i'm in a

46
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,880
relationship with i can smile i can say something kind to them i can serve them

47
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:06,400
i can call them up and call up a friend or someone say how are you doing you know

48
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,759
do you need anything do if they're alone can we hang out this weekend or something just could be

49
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:19,440
serviced could show up in very very small ways so how so basically instead of it being

50
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,600
about us to not make it about us not about me it's not about me it's not

51
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:33,520
about you it's not about me and this practice isn't about me me me me me make it not about

52
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,320
me and in the same way i'll share i'll share a quote

53
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,919
by marianne williamson um that has been attributed to so many

54
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:53,759
people but again within this perspective of service of shining of shining

55
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,440
our hearts shining our lights not from a place of ego like i'm great i'm fantastic but

56
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,560
shining our light from a place of service of a place of goodness

57
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,639
so i'll read this quote and then we'll start the practice together you might have heard

58
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,880
it before so here we go she says our deepest fear

59
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,080
is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond

60
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:30,080
measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves

61
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,479
who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you

62
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,560
not to be you're a child of god you're playing small does not serve the

63
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,599
world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure

64
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,720
around you we're all meant to shine as children do

65
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,360
we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it's not just in some

66
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:09,680
of us it's in everyone and and as we let our light our own light shine

67
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,160
we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from

68
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,919
our own fear our presence automatically liberates others so this way of shining

69
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:31,280
shining our light shining our goodness not in this self-centered way but as a

70
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,479
way of serving as a way of serving others letting this

71
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:45,759
light all the gifts that have been given to to be of service so

72
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:53,840
so with those as themes for our practice let's embrace

73
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:01,759
some silence let's practice together so i'd like to invite you

74
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:08,479
to get into your meditation posture whatever might be comfortable for you

75
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,840
sitting lying down

76
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,680
standing walking whatever it might be

77
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:27,840
before postures

78
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,959
since i'm sitting i'll give the instructions the touch points

79
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,839
with settings

80
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,560
translate for your own body posture

81
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,839
so sensing feeling your feet

82
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:09,839
your feet on the floor

83
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:28,800
connecting with the earth child of the earth child of the universe

84
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:37,839
all of us in our humanity not different

85
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:51,839
feeling your sit bones your lower legs

86
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,839
contacting the cushion or the chair

87
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:15,200
letting yourself land release release

88
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:33,839
releasing into the contact points with the earth

89
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,519
letting the breath breathe you soothe you

90
00:10:47,519 --> 00:11:01,839
settle and calm every muscle of the body

91
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,560
fighting your lower body your feet your legs ah

92
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:50,079
your sit bones to relax let go of any tension

93
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,040
so too your abdomen

94
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,839
the chest

95
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:11,839
shoulders neck but the arms feel heavy the hands

96
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,120
dropping their weight

97
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,839
letting the muscles of the face unwind

98
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,920
no need to wear any mask no smile or anything right now

99
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:52,639
releasing completely releasing

100
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,399
muscles behind the eyes

101
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:07,839
behind the jaw the chin the forehead

102
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:49,839
letting the weight of every muscle entire body to drop internally

103
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:03,839
to be released to be freed

104
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,360
if thoughts arise it's not a problem

105
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,720
inviting the thoughts to settle with the next breath

106
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:27,279
there's nothing wrong with thinking but for now we are calming inviting the mind to settle

107
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:34,240
thinking thought let's settle come back later

108
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:41,519
giving my heart to this practice to cultivating kindness

109
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:55,839
goodness right now

110
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,079
letting each breath feel the heart

111
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,079
fill the body with ease

112
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:33,840
settling more and more into this moment to the gift of this moment

113
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,840
i like to invite you if you wish

114
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,559
if you're sitting let yourself sit just a little taller

115
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:19,440
you need to adjust sitting just a little taller

116
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,120
the sense of integrity in your posture

117
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:34,559
a sense of nobility in this being

118
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:42,720
showing up on this cushion in this chair

119
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,520
with a role to play in service to serve others

120
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:58,159
for this life to unfold

121
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:04,960
according to your highest values which from the outside may not be

122
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:13,360
visible but from the inside

123
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,440
you know [Music] that cultivating goodness cultivating

124
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:27,840
kindness cultivating integrity

125
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,919
cultivating service compassion

126
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
friendliness

127
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:53,039
a brightness honesty so many other beautiful values

128
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,720
whatever there might be for you

129
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:09,200
are important to you as as if there were as if there was a

130
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,480
vertical line

131
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:23,840
aligning upholding lifting you up

132
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,120
is consideration uplifts you

133
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:45,919
as if opening your chest your heart to shine shine its goodness into the

134
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,039
world how may i be of service

135
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:58,559
how may i be of service how may this be life be of service

136
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,720
to goodness and goodness

137
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:19,840
not so much about me and mine what i get what i don't get

138
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:41,600
but turning the frame turning the frame of selfishness on its head

139
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:50,240
it's not about me what if it's not about me just this moment trying it on for size

140
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,400
you can always take it all back and make it all about you later but experiment

141
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:04,320
try it on for size for a moment cultivating goodness

142
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:14,080
menta friendliness

143
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,799
in service

144
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,720
in service to what is me and beyond me larger than me

145
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:36,240
greater than me greater than conception this conceiving that i have

146
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:43,840
of who i am and my role in the world

147
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,278
wishing wishing goodness for all beings everywhere

148
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:39,840
cultivating friendliness friendliness and goodwill

149
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:59,760
no matter what their circumstances are whether they're friends

150
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:08,880
or whether you have challenges with them or whether they in their own way they're causing harm

151
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:21,360
their own confusion

152
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,120
letting therapy kindness goodwill

153
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
unconditionally

154
00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:00,880
for the freedom of your own heart and letting your light shine

155
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,840
your goodness

156
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:17,840
shine in the world and be of service

157
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,080
and if you notice any judgments arising any self-judgments

158
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,399
as we discussed at the beginning i'm not doing this right i'm not good

159
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,080
enough my mind is distracted

160
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:42,159
what if this is not about me but how i am doing what if we can let go

161
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:50,399
of all of that taking the self out of the equation

162
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,840
this concern self concern me me my mind

163
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:08,559
how am i perceived how am i this just taking it all out how can this being be of service how can

164
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:16,559
i serve it's not about me it doesn't matter

165
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,840
we feel into that radical shift even for a split second

166
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:01,839
what if this isn't so much about me this self that i take myself to be

167
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,440
but beyond me this being is part of

168
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,640
the magnificent fabric of humanity

169
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:26,160
beyond my conception what if it's not just about me in this moment this cultivation of my

170
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,800
heart and goodness can i trust can i trust to let my

171
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:41,838
goodness shine without fear without fear

172
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,520
for the last moments of this practice

173
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:40,240
period and if there are any self-criticisms coming up

174
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,119
about oh i was distracted i'm sleepy

175
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,800
it's not about me this cultivation it's a gift how can i

176
00:37:52,800 --> 00:38:00,880
serve this is a gift of service showing up as best as possible in this

177
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,839
moment and letting go of the rest

178
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:19,838
showing up as well as we can as a gift

179
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,680
the gift of goodness

180
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,839
and letting go of the rest

181
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,079
may all beings be happy

182
00:38:46,079 --> 00:39:01,838
may all beings be free

188
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,359
and um yeah i would love to hear how this was

189
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,839
for you richard please

190
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:06,560
you could hear me yeah um i was recalling

191
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:14,480
the things i have been doing for other people today i did some

192
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,000
substantial good deeds but but i've also done things for myself i mean i listened

193
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,680
to a dharma talk i read a chapter in a very good book

194
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:32,720
i practice my my scales or whatever and and i really don't personally

195
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:40,720
see much difference there great beautiful that's it perfect

196
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:46,440
great because when you're talking about that i'm not hearing the self-criticism the

197
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:54,319
self-involvement it's more of a oh it's kind of it's it's the the things you're doing for your self

198
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:00,079
isn't so much it's just doing the scales it's just you know music is a gift or reading there's all

199
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:06,160
these beautiful it's as if you're cultivating yourself as this gift so of course i i don't see any

200
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,200
difference either it and it's really the attitude it's the way of seeing

201
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:17,200
that makes it makes it so so yeah beautiful we're on the same page

225
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:48,480
yes okay hi uh uh hi thank you the uh what stood out for me

226
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:58,240
was the invitation to sit up taller or straighter or more dignified

227
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,119
it kind of kind of was a was a was a signpost for me

228
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:12,560
but then i started kind of getting interested in the position of my my shoulders and my neck

229
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:19,119
and my chin and uh just ver just a very interested in embodied

230
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:26,720
uh place where i was you know making small movements uh uh raising my chin

231
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,800
realizing that that does make breathing a little bit easier but put some tension

232
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:38,000
on the back of the neck dropping the chin a little bit um which tends to balance

233
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,160
you know i think balance my head um and then um you know one of my intentions has has

234
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,440
really been to uh work on releasing releasing my shoulders

235
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:55,440
um i feel like i have 40 years of like clenched or maybe i probably didn't do that as a

236
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,560
baby so maybe 35 years of clenched

237
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,880
uh clenched shoulders to kind of work with but thank you thank you for the uh i think the

238
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,400
invitation to adjust posture um which uh which was uh which i liked

239
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,000
yeah thank you charlie and i'm really appreciating how you really took that invitation and

240
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,680
worked with it with a lot of awareness and mindfulness

241
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:30,000
of oh how the impact how these different minor adjustments are

242
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,440
having impact in both my physiology and in in my

243
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,480
in my perception so yeah very interesting

244
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:46,000
so tamara says greetings from campbell that was nice to release the focus from myself

so dear ones let's um practice in community how can we serve

250
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:23,520
each other in small groups is it possible for us to show up both for ourselves and for each other

251
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,800
for these beautiful beings who are practicing with us can we just show up in silence with them

252
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,720
maybe we don't even have to talk in the if our turn comes in the small triad and say you know i'm just

253
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:40,240

255
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,640
we don't have to say anything or you can share as little or as much as you like about your practice

256
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,680
let's show up with that spirit today in the small groups

257
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:04,560
