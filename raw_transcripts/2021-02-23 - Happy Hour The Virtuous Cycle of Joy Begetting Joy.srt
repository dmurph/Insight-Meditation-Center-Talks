3
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:25,599
exploring our new Brahma vihara which we started on Friday exploring mudita

4
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:33,040
vicarious Joy also translated has um uh empathetic

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,800
Joy it's it's happiness for for others happiness and we start where it's

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:48,480
easy um so this this practice of mudita um in poly the word is mudita m u

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,320
d t it's a transliteration uh in English is the

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,800
practice of gladdening the heart and mind it's the fastest way to become

9
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,560
happy is if you find yourself heavy and just bring to mind someone you care

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,080
about and their Good Fortune someone who you just feel happy for when they're

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,840
happy and and let their happiness shine through your heart sense of happiness

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:26,600
for their happiness so tonight what we'll do is that we'll um turn our hearts to an we

13
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,640
start with an easy category and then after we've primed our heart and we've

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:39,680
practiced with the easy category then we'll turn our attention to ourselves to

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:48,360
feel happy for our own blessings to feel a sense of celebration celebration in

16
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,600
the heart for blessings that we often have and we take for granted we turn our

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,600
hearts to that and guess what when we become happy for our own happiness the

18
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,759
practice of mudita when turned to ourselves becomes

19
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:12,599
the practice of guess what gratitude yay of course so that's where

20
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:18,800
the practice of gratitude is hiding in the Brahma viharas a lot of times people

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:26,000
say so where is gratitude in Buddhism there's not much talk of it well it's there it's in the Brahma vhar it's in

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
mudita when you turn mudita to yourself it becomes gratitude when you're happy for your own happiness

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,160
that's what arises the heart becomes grateful so see for

24
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:47,680
yourself anything else I want to say for frame oh yes and one thing I want to say to frame and we can talk more about it

25
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:55,440
afterwards is the far enemy of this practice as I mentioned is is Envy so

26
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,360
sometimes when we are trying to feel happy for somebody else's happy happiness oh we want what they have Al

27
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,959
so the kind of contraction come up in the in the heart if that comes up it's

28
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:15,920
okay this is a purification practice you're not defective you're not doing it wrong it can bring those feelings up it

29
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,480
may not it might and if that may happen please turn

30
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,599
towards that pain that's suffering in that moment with your own meta with your

31
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:35,760
own compassion because when Envy arises we the ones hurting in that moment so

32
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:43,640
instead of trying to muscle your way through it musle through your way with mud make it karuna make it compassion

33
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,840
turn to oh sweetie it's okay it's okay you want this also it's all right it's

34
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,599
okay so holding turning with compassion and

35
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,159
care towards whatever is arising so as long as you're doing that turning

36
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:06,959
towards love care warmth towards whatever is arising you're doing this

37
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:17,600
practice great so anything else I want to say yeah I'm

38
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,919
I've been looking forward to practicing together today I've actually been practicing as I've been remembering

39
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:31,800

40
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,039

you anything is

204
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:31,160
welcome Ben asks is this practice related to techniques of magnifying Pleasant Sensations as an entry way to

205
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:38,359
Janna um not not exactly um it's

206
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:43,599
not it's no the way you're talking about it it's not about a technique of

207
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,839
magnifying Pleasant sensation as an entryway to Jana

208
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:56,599
no and yet there are for all the Brahma viharas there are oh let me say what

209
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:04,560
janas are Jas are states of absorption there when in the practice of samata

210
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,520
samadi translated as concentration when one comes back to the same object over

211
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:15,640
and over and over again the mind can have a sense of

212
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:21,960
stability profound stability that can feel like absorption with the object as

213
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:28,720
if the mind is merging with the object often in the west we teach uh

214
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,440
absorptions with anapanasati with the breath but there are many different

215
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:41,119
objects so there are 40 different objects in fact in in this uh

216
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,599
tradition so related to your question Ben um there are absorptions there are

217
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:54,040
Jas or states of stability for each of the four Brahma viharas so MTI vicarious

218
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,640
Joy if one practices it keep keep practicing keep practicing the mind will

219
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:06,079
become stable and um will get will reach

220
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,319
absorption which feels very different has a different flavor than absorption

221
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:16,400
through the breath so that it answers your question Jeanie

222
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,640
says I chose my aunt as benefactor she died yesterday morning a it was very

223
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,319
sweet that is very sweet thank you Jeanie for sharing that thank you so

224
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:37,640
much for sharing that yeah yeah Ben says it sounds like rever

225
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:42,720
mita's reverse anxiety where anxiety is a vicious cycle Mita as you taught is a

226
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,839
virtuous cycle absolutely it is a virtual cycle yes

227
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:54,640
bringing the mind to goodness to gladness and there is so much to be glad

228
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:02,599
happy about for others or for ourselves not just turning our hearts to what's challenging and

229
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:10,400
difficult any the other Reflections what was easy what was challenging what you discovered what

230
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,720
surprised you especially if you're new would love to hear from you hear your wisdom and

231
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:23,319
please know that whatever you share is is a gift to the community Jerry says I

232
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:28,640
had forgotten about a benefactor and realized how I am where I am right now

233
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:35,160
because of him it made more it made more of aware it made me more aware of a

234
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:44,319
deeper sense of gratitude beautiful thank you for sharing that Jerry I feel the same way with the with the friend I

235

happiness for them I couldn't stop smiling so lovely

237
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:06,520

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,559

off and not participate see how happy making this can be

270
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:51,200
so so I'm going to create the rooms

271
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:58,480
and um here we go opening them up

272
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:05,200
okay welcome back everyone their rooms are closed and we have a couple of minutes

273
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,880
for any observations how how were the groups

274
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:18,319
what was the practice like to share to share your joy with each other I see lots of people smiling this is great so

275
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:23,839
we'd love to hear from you please especially if you haven't spoken

276
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:28,839

277
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:39,520
anybody would like anybody anyone who's smiling ear to ear wants to okay Fred here please there you

278
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:46,680
go and not so much on our group but I was I was realizing that the the person

279
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:53,359
I picked as my benefactor who's in fact going to drop by and be my benefactor

280
00:47:53,359 --> 00:48:00,280
again tomorrow um would choose me as as her benefactor too and um and might be

281
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:08,200
surprised that I would think of her as my benefactor but um there's a kind of reciprocity or

282
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:13,720
maybe not not even that quite it's a kind of mutuality that's really

283
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:20,079
uh at the heart of it yeah yeah and isn't that sweet that people can be our

284
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:26,359
benefactors in in a way that they've supported us not in a big way of being the benefit but just in a way they've

285
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:33,359
supported us without them really knowing or us being theirs it's just such a beauty in the mutuality that you just

286
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:39,920
pointed out so thank you for sharing that yeah and Julie

287
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:55,599
please um uh I just wanted to share that um coming into the um group tonight I

288
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:01,079
was feeling really tired just a long day

289
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:06,280
at work and yada yada yada and um it's

290
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:13,960
amazing how connection can be so energizing and how we we I I thought I

291
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,920
was tired you know and perhaps physically I may still be but um when we

292
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,280
connect like this just as a a larger group like this and then in our smaller

293
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,559
groups it's just like amplifies it and then we get to bring it back here and

294
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:37,839
then we get to say goodbye and we get to take it into our you know our immediate worlds here and it just when I Envision

295
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:44,760
it it just you know and on and on and on so thank you all for being here because

296
