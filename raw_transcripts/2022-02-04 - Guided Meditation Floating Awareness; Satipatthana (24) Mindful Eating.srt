1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:07,839
good morning good day everyone and um

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,599
one of the things that we are doing in doing sati patana practice practice

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,880
of establishing awareness is

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,960
learning to not only pay attention to

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,160
the details of what's happening the moment right now we're doing the body breathing

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,280
body activities but we're also beginning to

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,640
understand the other half of the equation the awareness part how we're aware

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,520
and um and in a sense uh the the the activities we do can be a

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,879
mirror to how we are to and also how we are aware

10
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:02,960
it's possible to be aware in a contracted way in a tense way it's possible to be aware in a

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,080
complacent you know hardly committed way

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:15,360
and it's possible to be aware with a very relaxed open but

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,560
engaged awareness so for this purpose i want to do a small

14
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,040
exercise with you and and that is uh if you would open your

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,320
eyes and find some spot maybe a small object or something

16
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,280
and uh if you would kind of uh fix safe

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,960
look at it but really kind of stare at it fix your attention there in a one-pointed way

18
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,720
and just look at this look at the object without wavering just you know lock onto it and just look at

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,159
it and and don't let your eyes kind of waver or shake or anything just hold

20
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,360
your attention there so very focused very intent

21
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,679
and as you do so notice what's happened to your

22
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,920
breathing notice what's happened to your body

23
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,520
notice the quality of your mind

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,000
so now uh relax maybe take a moment to close your

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,920
eyes and breathe deeply and relax

26
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,120
and then open your eyes again and look at this object

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,000
but rather than fixating your attention on it let your your eyes kind of float in your

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,879
eye sockets and just look at the different parts of it maybe trace the contours of it

29
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,239
uh kind of look at then what's what will be the bottom of it the top the sides

30
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,920
just let yourself kind of wonder and aim your attention so you're still kind of centered on the

31
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,480
object but you're kind of floating swimming around your attention

32
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,400
on the object or with the object there

33
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,840
and now notice your breathing

34
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,599
notice your body how it feels notice

35
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,440
what your mind your awareness is it the awareness

36
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,480
tight or contracted or is it more spacious and loose

37
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:53,760
and so i don't know if this exercise worked for everyone but generally

38
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,040
when people fixate their eyes to focus on something it tends to create tension it's kind of

39
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,400
an unnatural thing to do to hold the attention fixated like that

40
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,640
and it takes effort and work and certain kind of tension what's more natural for the eyes is to

41
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,680
kind of constantly be on the move gently relaxedly

42
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,000
maybe not so much we don't necessarily realize that my eyes are kind of dancing around slightly but what's nice

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,759
is for the eyes is to have the eyes move so it takes in the object of

44
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:34,080
attention from different perspectives different angles different parts of it so the eyes are not fixated the eyes are

45
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,280
quite loose and soft and flowing around the object

46
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,560
as the mind gets tense as the mind gets fixated or preoccupied

47
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,440
or afraid or angry or desirous the mind tends to lock up or become

48
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,639
tighter or fit more fixed like the fixed eyes and um

49
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,199
and in uh with mindfulness mindfulness awareness the mind that awareness gets loosened up

50
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:10,479
and we allow awareness to kind of certainly focus on the breath on different objects but we are kind of

51
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,759
floating with it then taking it in in different kind of angles and ways and

52
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:22,000
and um so just with the experience of breathing for example uh you don't we don't hold the attention

53
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,160
on the breath rather we place the attention in the area where we experience

54
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,360
breathing and we allow the different sensations that come into play

55
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,560
to do their dance to appear and awareness kind of floats between it

56
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,600
and moves around it it's all with the breathing but the awareness is kind of

57
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,479
as loose and relaxed with the breathing maybe a little bit like a

58
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,759
like a uh if you were floating maybe on a rubber

59
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,919
mattress or you know boat or something on a just floating and relaxing laying on top

60
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,160
of a of the ocean with gentle waves coming up you're right there with the waves but

61
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:15,280
the waves come and go you're not fixating on the ocean you're allowing the waves to lift you and drop you and

62
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,560
you're feeling all the different contours of the wave as it moves through your body

63
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,759
and this kind of attention allows for hopefully a deeper sensitivity

64
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,120
to our experience and as we continue to do this practice

65
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,479
we are actually looking for or or awakening a deeper sensitivity

66
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,000
to our sense experience the physical experience of what's happening

67
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,520
and beginning to allow the awareness to rest on it or

68
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,599
stay present but in a way that's soft and relaxed it kind of floats

69
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,720
on top of the different things that appear and disappear

70
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,599
so to gently

71
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,759
lower your gaze with your eyes still open

72
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:22,000
and lower and have your eyes kind of looking down at about 45 degrees

73
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,160
not looking at anything in particular

74
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:35,360
but just gently letting the eyes kind of subtly move and roam and

75
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,880
be relaxed and not trying to see anything but just kind of

76
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,520
maybe things are even a little bit out of focus that's okay so you're not fixating on anything

77
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,319
and now if it's comfortable gently close your eyes

78
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,520
and now with your awareness let your awareness float around your

79
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,759
body in whatever way the body calls whatever way

80
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:22,560
awareness wants to travel whatever just gently slowly relaxedly

81
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,840
the awareness is centered on the body but loose and relaxed

82
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,198
just floating between different sensations and experiences

83
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,399
and as the mind the awareness floats around if you notice any tension

84
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,440
if it's easy enough without fixating the mind

85
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,800
the relaxed attention

86
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,560
maybe allowing awareness to slide

87
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,760
down with the relaxation along the relaxation

88
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,839
and then settling your awareness on your

89
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,880
breathing the sensations of the body that come

90
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,399
into play as you breathe whether it's the movements of the belly

91
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,519
the chest sensations in the nostril

92
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:24,720
or some broader global experience of the body breathing

93
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,519
rest in those sensations in that area

94
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,720
and let your awareness gently almost not

95
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,920
out of choice isn't like you're doing it almost as if the natural tendency for

96
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,160
awareness to float and move it

97
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,079
floats and moves within the experience of breathing

98
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:15,480
so the mind is not fixating on the breathing but orienting itself on the breathing

99
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,000
as the sensations of breathing change so the

100
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
awareness floats on the change

101
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,320
as awareness naturally loosely

102
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,480
floats it sometimes floats between sensations

103
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,519
maybe there's no rhyme or reason of which sensations you pick up at any given time

104
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:21,240
but be oriented to the sensations of breathing in a relaxed loose way

105
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,319
perhaps allowing for a growing sensitivity

106
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,600
for how the body feels experiences

107
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,040
the details of breathing

108
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:08,720
floating on the sensations of breathing as if you have all the time in the world

109
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,199
no hurry

110
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,120
oh

111
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:40,720
if the mind wanders off in thought notice if the mind is fixated or tight

112
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:48,800
if it is relax the mind if you wonder often thought innocently

113
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,440
kind of floating off into some kind of thinking

114
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:00,000
then float the mind back to the breathing gently

115
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,959
settle back in again

116
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,000
awareness resting on the waves of sensations

117
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:25,640
developing a heightened sensitivity to the body's experience of breathing

118
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,919
you

119
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,760
as part of this meditation

120
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,679
while you're still sitting quietly

121
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,440
i would like to read this section of the text

122
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,679
that we're studying this week and the reason to read it while you're

123
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:53,440
still meditating is that the primary way down through the

124
00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:00,880
centuries that people have encountered this text is not as something to read and study

125
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,039
but something to listen to as it was chanted

126
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:15,520
or something to participate with by chanting it and chanting repeatedly the same

127
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:23,600
passages over and over again has a very different effect on how we learn and how we're changed

128
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,559
then studying so because it's closer to this chanting

129
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:37,880
way of taking in the text i'd like to read it now as the end of the meditation

130
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,760
a practitioner is one who acts in full awareness

131
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:54,240
when going forward and returning who acts in full awareness when looking

132
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,520
ahead and looking away who acts in full awareness

133
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,440
when flexing and extending the limbs who acts in full awareness when wearing

134
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:12,240
clothes and carrying their plates and silverware

135
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:19,039
who acts in full awareness when eating drinking consuming foods

136
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:27,360
tasting who acts in full awareness when defecating and urinating

137
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,840
who acts in full awareness when walking standing sitting

138
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,159
falling falling asleep waking up

139
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:44,880
talking and keeping silent in this way

140
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,520
one abides observing the body in regards to the body

141
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,960
internally externally and both internally and externally

142
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:06,720
when abides contemplating the body and its nature of arising its nature of vanishing

143
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,760
in its nature of both arising and vanishing

144
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:19,760
or else awareness is established there is a body

145
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:27,039
just to the extent necessary for bear knowledge and lucid awareness

146
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:33,360
and one abides independent not clinging to anything in the world

147
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,760
this is how a practitioner abides observing the body

148
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,880
in regards to the body

149
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:54,559
and may it be that each of these activities we do that they're infused with an aspiration

150
00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:00,960
and orientation to do so for the benefit of the world

151
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:09,039
that somehow we're developing ourselves cultivating ourselves to be

152
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
caring people for this world somehow we are also

153
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,840
orienting ourselves to a life of caring for self and others

154
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,600
and making this a better world for for all beings

155
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:35,640
may all beings be free and happy

156
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:47,809
[Music]

157
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,640
thank you

158
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:10,080
so the direction that this satipatana practice goes to

159
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:16,080
is the ability to have a loose open clear awareness

160
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,760
that is able to wisely float and be around to all aspects of our human

161
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:30,480
experience and whether it's the body or the feelings mind states mental processes

162
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:37,120
the experiences of the world our thoughts and ultimately it's not a matter of keeping

163
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,559
it limited to some particular domain of our life

164
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:48,399
but able to kind of take it all in as a because awareness is starting to become free

165
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:54,399
loose relaxed open receptive and um

166
00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:01,039
and so uh in different circumstances then uh it will the mind will sometimes be aware of

167
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:07,519
thinking sometimes the body sometimes feeling sometimes emotion sometimes sounds what's around us

168
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,519
to some degree going along with the call of whatever is happening to some degree also having

169
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,519
some choice about where it's important to bring attention an orientation

170
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,519
an aspiration maybe based on compassion or healing or

171
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:32,960
you know what's beneficial what's fun all kinds of things that we might choose to and

172
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,080
so there's a play between choice and non-choice with awareness is

173
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,320
something we become wise with and something that we begin enjoying even to to do

174
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,519
in the beginning of sati patana it's often a strong emphasis on the body

175
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:56,799
breathing in the body with kind of limiting the orientation to that because if we go too quickly to the full

176
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,960
range of all the different things we can pay attention to floating through them that more likely the mind simply gets

177
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,240
hijacked and held hostage by the thinking mind and the thoughts

178
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,600
and and so we're kind of cultivating the ability of the mind to relax

179
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,600
it's thinking the grip of thoughts the grip of preoccupation by coming back to the breathing

180
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:25,600
and it's very important to realize that's what we're doing it isn't so much that we're we're developing the muscle of

181
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,519
concentration which to some degree we are but if we can be over emphasized and people can

182
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:38,799
get tense and tight it's a big part of what we're doing is um decreasing

183
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:45,200
the the the impulse the attachment that

184
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,960
sometimes addiction the the strong kind of orientation fixation

185
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,640
on certain limited parts of our human experience it could be a lot often into thoughts

186
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,039
ideas memories planning it can be our emotions and feelings

187
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:09,440
even sometimes it can be the body work we're stuck on we're learning to relax that

188
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,200
and then as we relax it more and more then it becomes a whole different game to be able to

189
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,519
settle in and to be with the like the breathing or the body and um

190
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:27,120
and so this this is part of the field in which we're practicing this this this

191
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:33,039
and why i want to bring it up today is that i want to talk about a particular activity

192
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:38,640
to which to bring full awareness to and which mentioned in the text

193
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:45,679
and that is eating mindful eating where meal time

194
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,960
is meditation time meal time is mindfulness time

195
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,399
and it's one of the real wonderful places to cultivate mindfulness and well

196
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,480
use it as a kind of case study for bringing mindfulness into daily life

197
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,320
so um not few people eat uh an automatic pilot

198
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:15,440
they eat with lot not a lot of a careful attention as they're eating uh maybe they're if you're eating alone we have

199
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,679
uh you know listening to a podcast or watching the news or watching something on the screen

200
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:28,000
listening to the radio old days would read the newspaper

201
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,118
maybe with eating other people it were absorbed in the conversation and hardly

202
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,638
noticing that we're eating and what we're eating sometimes the eating is done quickly i'm

203
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,079
i'm a kind of not fast eater so i know that well and um so

204
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:50,560
it's so quickly that we you know are not really taking in the experience of eating

205
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:57,200
and when the eating is kind of automatic or in this kind of way that gives often free reign to the mind

206
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:04,079
to do whatever it wants to do and the mind has a strong tendency to be fixated or preoccupied by things

207
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:10,560
or to be given too much freedom to kind of travel down its highways and byways

208
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,880
then we actually live a truncated life a limited life and even though it might seem like it's

209
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,720
unlimited because we can think about unlimited number of things it's really a small domain

210
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,720
of our life and so to sit down to eat and

211
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:35,920
from time to time it's really wonderful to have a chance to eat alone or to eat uh quietly without speaking

212
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:44,079
so that you can just be you can just be eating and nothing else

213
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,680
and um the um the uh

214
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,880
you would um um you know and and so if you just with the

215
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,320
eating and then you're really kind of floating your attention with the experience

216
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,079
giving means you're not in a hurry you're there just to be with the experience all the different pieces of

217
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:11,920
the experience with full awareness of the body it's all the physical things that come into play

218
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,760
as you're eating one of the things that i found really nice to do around eating especially when

219
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:24,079
i'm eating alone or quietly in meditative kind of way is to notice

220
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,680
the first moment where i feel the hunger is no longer there and i feel

221
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,599
the simplest form of satiation i'm not full uh there might be a

222
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:42,560
in my mind in my in my situation kind of a desire in the mouth

223
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:50,400
in the tongue for more um there's me i don't know if it's a maybe a pull for pleasure or something

224
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:57,680
or the mouth and the tongue get the news that i'm full last and so there's still this drive to want to eat

225
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,880
and and but i try to pay attention the first time when i basically no longer hungry

226
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,200
and feel kind of the simplest satiation and then stop eating then and then notice what happens

227
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,800
notice that there might still be desires the desires for pleasure or that pull or the impulse

228
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:21,280
and sit and it's fascinating sit and watch it and see what howard morphs and changes when we don't give into it don't

229
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,880
reinforce it but make room for it to feel it it's not exactly the same as denying

230
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,119
ourselves it's actually something more like allowing

231
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,400
an impulse a desire to be there in its pristine glory

232
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:46,960
without giving into it and to allow to just feel oh there it is practicing mindfulness with that desire

233
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,960
one of the things to learn from mindful eating is how mindless we eat

234
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:00,480
and that's fascinating to notice maybe you know are we eating in a hurry are we eating uh in order to

235
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,880
um you know what you know are we are eating too much are we afraid is there anxiety

236
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:13,040
around food as we eat is there a greed as we eat

237
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,960
is there a lot of confusion around food when we're eating it and and then

238
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,720
take time to feel and be with that give a second and third and fourth look

239
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,560
at those feelings that are connected to eating some of those feelings do not have to be

240
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,400
present or not in don't inherently have to be present as we eat

241
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:44,839
and some of those feelings limit our natural capacity to be attuned to the body's own

242
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:50,160
intuition about what to eat and how to eat and and how much to eat

243
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,359
and i've really appreciated uh as i became more sensitive

244
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,400
to uh feel that the body kind of had an intuition on its own about

245
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,440
how to eat when to eat what to pick up at different times out of the plate

246
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:12,640
and um and uh and there's kind of a deeper knowing the body has that we can tune into if we

247
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,760
develop this deeper sensitivity of mindfulness

248
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,040
it's also a great pleasure to eat mindfully to eat in silence and be kind of

249
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,079
just absorbed in the pleasure of eating and just kind of taking it all in and

250
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,440
enjoying it but so fully that the thinking mind gets quieter

251
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,079
because it's not such a big part of the experience and it's possible to eat a meal i mean

252
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,440
especially if you eat in silence eat a meal and feel clearer and more relaxed and

253
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,960
more open by the time it finishes i've known some people who really enjoy

254
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,119
eating mindfully and will spend actually quite a long period of time

255
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:03,599
um uh just taking their time to eat generally it's best to do that alone if

256
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,200
you're eating socially because even in you know that you don't you have you know other

257
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,319
people are long finished before you're done but take your time to eat

258
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:21,359
i've done that i've done that in a lot of different ways taking my time to eat and sometimes the sense of pleasure

259
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:27,119
meditative absorption absorptive pleasure around it has been quite strong

260
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:35,040
the and sometimes because you know i said i'm sometimes a fast eater by you know

261
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:41,119
since i was a child sometimes in order to cultivate this greater mindfulness for me

262
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,480
i have eaten with my non-dominant hand

263
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,480
and and that just kind of brought an interesting kind of more attention to what i was doing

264
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,839
and when i've really gotten into it really enjoyed it and really kind of felt like i was doing it slowly

265
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:04,640
i would actually put my utensil down between bites and i would

266
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,720
put put a a fork full of food in my mouth put it put the fork down and then just

267
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,760
be with the chewing and when the chewing and had and after i swallowed then i'd pick up the fork

268
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,880
again and that would certainly be for me would be a little antidote to

269
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,560
the habit of putting food in my mouth and then while i'm chewing

270
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,640
digging in for the next bite you know it's innocent enough but to really kind of be present for the

271
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:39,280
experience to put the fork down so as we do this

272
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:46,319
the activity of eating is a mirror for our attitudes and our approaches and our what's going on for us

273
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:52,720
and that's part of mindfulness practice to really see that and if some of those attitudes are not so helpful for you

274
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:59,040
um what's important part of mindfulness practice is to the degree to which you're able to shift that to let go of

275
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:05,920
it in a relaxed way do so the degree to which you can begin to have some choice about their attitudes

276
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,680
of the mind you want to exercise that choice but don't be worried if you can't or

277
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,680
don't force it and then and also as you're doing this you're

278
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,200
also becoming aware of how you're aware is there a fixation that the mind and

279
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:30,079
awareness and can the awareness be soft and loose maybe if this metaphor works for you can

280
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:35,839
be floating around the whole experience of sitting there eating and being with the experience of the

281
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:41,040
the food of the arm lifting up to put the bite in your mouth

282
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:47,599
the experience of the food being taken into the mouth and the movements of the tongue and the taste and the chewing

283
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,880
just really be there for it and then over time as the mindfulness

284
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:59,920
gets stronger then the attention can float between all these different areas

285
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:07,200
it's not necessarily fixated or not fixated but not necessarily settled or centered only on the physical experience

286
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:14,800
of eating but it's centered on the wholeness of who we are as we eat that includes the eating

287
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:22,960
so i offer you this before this will be the last talk on mindfulness of activities and i offer it

288
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,640
to you to you as a case study to explore and and

289
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:35,680
and maybe to uh to use over this weekend maybe you can take a couple of meals

290
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,160
that uh you sit quietly by yourself or maybe you're with someone who's a meditator you can ask to eat the meal in

291
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,280
silence together and and and explore uh

292
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:54,640
what the benefits are and what the richness is and what the challenges are in uh eating mindfully

293
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:01,680
without a hurry just eating so thank you

294
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:10,800
and i want to make a couple of announcements that might interest some of you one is that periodically imc has a

295
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,720
mindfulness circle for black identified practitioners

296
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,240
and if you are or know some black mindfulness practitioners who

297
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:28,560
would like to join the circle um it's a little bit of meditation a little bit of teaching instructions and

298
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:34,400
a chance to be in a in a zoom circle uh to be in discussions around mindfulness

299
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,240
and so the next one is starting a week from saturday i believe it's the 12th

300
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,079
of uh february and there's information about that on imc's website

301
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:52,000
and on the homepage on the what's new and the other thing is if some of you

302
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,720
would like to come and sit a retreat that i teach then i am

303
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:04,160
you know i teach number of them at irc but they're sometimes difficult to get into

304
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:09,599
the insight retreat center i'm also teaching one in april at spirit rock
