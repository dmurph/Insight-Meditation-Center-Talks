1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,400
so good day everyone greetings

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,119
and you know we've come together to do this

3
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,800
meditation and

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,320
the obvious thing is that the act of coming down to meditate sit down here to

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,920
be here to meditate together is an action and

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,000
meditation itself is a kind of action or in the traditional buddhist language

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
it's like it's kama karma which literally means action

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,840
and many people associate meditation with being rather than doing but the movement

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,080
to let go to allow itself to be um that is also an action that we do something we're doing

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,360
we let go so we can be and um and the

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,720
buddha tended to define people if he defined people or described people

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,200
by what they do not by how they are in a sense of

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,640
how they're born especially in ancient india that born into a particular caste was not

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:38,320
interesting for the buddha but how people acted and behaved did they behave ethically or not

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,759
and this is all leading up to the idea that um that in meditation sometimes people

16
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,840
focus a lot on their experience and they maybe they're not having a good experience and so they're trying to have

17
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,200
a better experience or let go of something that seems you know not good and

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,600
and fix it or something and and or try to do something that creates a great

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,920
experience and so they measure themselves by how they are and

20
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,879
in another whole approach is to let let be in a certain sense how you

21
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:23,680
are and now focus a little bit more on what you do

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,720
the actions so in meditation there are two actions

23
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,519
related to concentration that are important there's the action of

24
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,720
beginning again the action of the mind wanders off and we place it back in this case on the

25
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:50,560
breathing and we connect again with the breathing and the second act action is the action

26
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,640
of hanging in there with the breath once where we've landed on the breathing to continue

27
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,400
on the breathing and uh and and that's a little bit of an action

28
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,800
to do so and some people don't engage that way and so they're able to connect to the

29
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,080
breathing but they quickly wander off again because there isn't that second action okay now

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,959
stay there linger there hang out there get to know it better feel and explore the the breathing

31
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:27,440
really stay present and now so that's one whole thing but

32
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:35,200
the other thing that's the one what i want to stress today is that the orientation

33
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,040
around action is to do it in a way that's nourishing

34
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,760
to do it in a way that's enjoyable that's wholesome that nourishes us

35
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,439
has a good influence on us so that it's not just the action to do something quickly and

36
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,560
get it done with but to do something with an action that has a nice influence so it's

37
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,040
nourishing it's wholesome for our system so the very ideal way in which we the

38
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,040
mind wonders often thought the way we come back from that where we recognize that come back

39
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,799
reconnect to the breathing that's an action that we try to do it in a way that's

40
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,320
wholesome that's nourishing that's pleasant that has a good influence on us so he

41
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,400
wouldn't jerk the mind back we wouldn't attack the breath again bear down

42
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,080
we wouldn't be ambitious with greed and and for some kind of meditate meditation

43
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:42,320
states we're not expecting something demanding something it's more like like almost like a

44
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,240
tai chi movement you know that the movement itself is satisfying the movement itself is

45
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,280
meaningful that we come back and we just enjoy the coming back

46
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,960
because it's nourishing and wholesome and like we come back with care with love with with um

47
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,840
and then the second action of sustaining the attention over time hanging in there not bearing

48
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:16,400
down not keeping the mind in check not reigning the mind in all these forceful things but how can we

49
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:25,520
be stay in a nourishing supportive wholesome way a caring way and this art

50
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,960
and this exploration of how to have the actions we do in meditation the mental

51
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,120
actions be nourishing be satisfying be

52
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,560
you know enjoyable gladdening for us is part of this art and uh so learning exploring thinking

53
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,080
about this as we meditate so that um you know

54
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,960
we are not so goal oriented with the action but rather maybe like tai chi or

55
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,800
beautiful qigong practice where our dance practice we're just doing the movement

56
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:10,080
is so satisfying and meaningful that's the important thing not where it gets us and so

57
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,840
the movement of landing and staying on the breath the movement of of staying there and

58
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,440
sustaining it that's that's what supports uh a

59
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,280
uh nourishing samadhi nourishing concentration

60
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:35,840
um so to assume your meditation posture

61
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,520
and prepare yourself for the meditation a bit

62
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,880
to consider how you can be here in a wholesome way

63
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,720
how you can be here so that you enter into your the activity of

64
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,919
meditation with a sense of beauty or nourishment or

65
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:08,000
wholesomeness not in a hurry

66
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:17,840
not resisting anything

67
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:30,240
not expecting or demanding that your meditation should be a certain way

68
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:38,400
and then beginning right away to see if you can land on your breathing

69
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,919
connect to your breathing in a nourishing way in a nice way

70
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:52,160
wholesome way so the very way in which you take in the breathing and aware of it

71
00:07:52,160 --> 00:08:01,840
has some maybe spaciousness care [Music] love tenderness

72
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:13,360
some way of being as you would be with a a good friend you care for

73
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,960
and the way you attend your garden when you're in love with your garden

74
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:34,479
and then in this caring nourishing way taking a slow gentle deep breath

75
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:43,839
allowing yourself to take in and feel the goodness of a deeper breath

76
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,480
and the goodness of allowing that to happen

77
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,839
and then relaxing as you exhale

78
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:09,839
relaxing your whole body

79
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,319
letting your breathing return to normal

80
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,040
and can you adjust a little bit your state of mind your state of your heart

81
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,600
just a little if that's all that's possible so you have a nice attitude a good

82
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,399
attitude wholesome

83
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,880
as if you're getting ready to

84
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:54,480
do tai chi or mental tai chi or mental gardening

85
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,519
and mental caring for something that you

86
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,320
love perhaps by relaxing the thinking mind

87
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:18,240
softening the energy of thinking

88
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:33,839
relaxing the muscles that are connected to thinking the pressure the tension to be here

89
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,000
and then gently calmly connecting to the beginning of the

90
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:01,839
in-breath receiving the beginning of the in-breath

91
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:11,360
and then sustaining the attention for however short or long the in-breath

92
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:22,720
is so you're there with a full in-breath sustained attention

93
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,440
connecting with the beginning of the out breath

94
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:43,839
and then sustaining the whole out breath

95
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,240
and these two movements of connecting

96
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:02,399
receiving the beginning of each in-breath and out-breath and then to

97
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:11,839
sustain the attention on the full out-breath the fallen breath

98
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:20,000
can you do that in a wholesome way nourishing way

99
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,639
it is an action can you make it an action which is free of greed or hatred

100
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,240
or delusion confusion free of

101
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,240
wanting it to be different

102
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,760
pushing something away aversion

103
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,560
is simplicity of maybe generosity

104
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,839
love and care

105
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,240
and the attention to the breathing

106
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:09,440
and to support the sustained attention through the exhale especially

107
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,680
you might count the exhales

108
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,040
a gentle careful count of one that maybe gets stretched out the

109
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:28,500
whole length of the exhale one [Music]

110
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,800
and then the next exhale two

111
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:54,079
if you lose count start over again and count up to ten or up to three

112
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,959
or up to one

113
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,759
exploring the wholesomeness and nourishment

114
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:17,839
of attending to the breathing

115
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,840
so then as we come to the end of this sitting

116
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:05,679
what do you know about having your mind be wholesome

117
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,320
nourishing

118
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,279
the mind which feels satisfied

119
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,399
and if the mind is not that way

120
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:29,840
can you remember that the mind is a collection

121
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,960
of mental activities it's not a thing

122
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:42,399
what can you adjust mentally your way you think what you think

123
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:49,840
what you're oriented towards what you're expecting hoping for

124
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,120
so that how you are mentally or heartfully

125
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:05,120
feels as if it has a good influence on you maybe if things are hard that what has a

126
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,200
good influence is to be forgiving

127
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,840
or to be friendly

128
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,440
or to be generous towards yourself

129
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:45,840
to have compassion for the challenges

130
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:53,360
to appreciate whatever wholesomeness is here

131
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,840
nourishment there is here

132
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:10,480
and let that be a reference point stay close to that or either feeling it or imagining it

133
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:18,960
and then again imagine that you're with someone who is challenging for you

134
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:27,840
but you don't have to speak or do anything you're just sitting in the same room together

135
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:36,880
and staying close to your nourishing mind your wholesome mind and heart

136
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,320
without having to do or say anything what happens if you take in the other

137
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,158
person the challenging person

138
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:56,559
if you think about them is there some way that

139
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:03,440
then there's a chance for your care your friendliness your tenderness

140
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,840
to be touched by that other person

141
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,720
and you staying close to that place where you feel wholesome

142
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,320
a way of being that feels satisfying for you

143
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:34,960
so not getting caught up in shoulds and shouldn'ts he said she said the resentments

144
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:41,120
the fears just staying close to what's wholesome for you

145
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:50,480
has a good influence on you

146
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:57,360
and then imagine that you do so for the whole world that you include the

147
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,919
whole world and your wholesome heart your wholesome mind your wholesome

148
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,480
awareness

149
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:17,200
that wholesomeness is the reference point for how to think and feel about other

150
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:24,480
people may all beings

151
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:32,080
be happy may all beings

152
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,960
be safe

153
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,840
may all beings be peaceful

154
00:31:42,799 --> 00:32:01,840
and may all beings everywhere be free

155
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,440
you
