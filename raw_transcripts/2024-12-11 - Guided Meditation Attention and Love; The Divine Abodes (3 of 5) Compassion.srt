my my head and my heart feel so run

19

through by space but

20

uh my belly belly I associate with the

21
00:05:53,639 --> 00:06:00,120
Earth groundedness stability

22
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,560
gravity e

23
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,319
just keeping contact with the

24
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Earth e

25
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,159
breathing in such a way that

26
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:31,000
uh each breath connects you more deeply to the

27
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,880
Earth to the Earth element to sense of

28
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:40,959
groundedness

29
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
rootedness

30
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

31
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320

e for

34
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:42,880
we pay attention in part to

35
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,600
discover what we

36
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,920
love to discover our love

37
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,120
to let the subtlety and refinement the

38

care what actually matters to us Moment by moment

41

for

42
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

43
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,079
e for

44
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:08,279
we don't insist upon answering the question where is my love what do I love

45
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,720
we or just very patient offering our

46
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,839
attention letting the the poignancy

47
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:38,560
of having been born just come to us in its own

48
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
time e

49
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,759
that sometime in due

50
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:47,199
time the uh necessity of Love dawns unmistakably

51
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,880
from the groundedness of our

52
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,240
belly begin to uh fill out our

53
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:32,039

sensitive flexible

56
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,840
very strong because it's flexible

57
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:08,120
becomes very natural to wish ourselves

58
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
well

59
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640

how can you express care for yourself

care for your life with your attention in this

64
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
moment

65
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

66
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440

00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
e e

72
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,000
as we uh become grounded

73
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:30,240
open just one drop of uh love flavors everything

74
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,120
hatred becomes a kind

75
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,039
of fever dream

76
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,880
easy to put down I will not

77
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,440
betray my heart my

78
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:29,159
love it hurts uh too much whatever job hatred is supposed to

79
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:33,559
do something else can do it

80
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:50,559
better so we breathe we feel our

81
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
love e

82
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,080
for

83
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,339
[Music]

84
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,080
e

85
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:19,720
okay good to uh good to say with

86
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,960
you so um

87
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,200
du uh usually rendered as um

88
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:44,279
suffering is uh is everywhere everywhere

89
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:52,518
and obvious um but also kind of

90
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,320
shocking from the uh the maim andaya

91
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,760
the the Buddha says this this D I have reached is deep hard to

92
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,960
see difficult to awaken to quiet and

93
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:17,200
excellent not confined by thought subtle

94
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,679
sensed by the

95
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:32,240
wise Dua in other words is is both easy and hard to

96
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:39,440
see when there's some hard moment uh there some part of us that

97
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,240
can barely believe it you know like how could it have unfolded this way how

98
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:54,519
could the universe do this Hal Alan an artist and um

99
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:59,760
psychologist wrote this kind of uh grief poem

100
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:08,760
um or she included the lines that the the patients who come to me swarmed with

101
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:14,799
misery and astonishment their hearts like newborns

102
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:24,360
after the first needle Duke uh can uh can feel like

103
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:32,039
that and the question how should I love how do I respond to

104
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:38,440
this that that never gets fully answered people who think they know how to

105
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:46,679
love think they've answered the question how should I love they stop growing how do I love is

106
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:51,360
not a question it's a

107
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:59,360
 the Buddha asks us to to comprehend suffering to comprehend

108
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:05,960
suffering and the act of comprehending highlights the necessity of love if we

109
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:13,760
actually get close enough to perceiving

110
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:21,840
suffering you don't need to be told about the necessity of love it becomes

111
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,279
self-evident because you can sense that there's no way to meet meet the

112
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:34,519
intensity of The Human Condition without crumbling or clinging unless we steep

113
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:42,440
ourselves in love and the alternatives to

114
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:49,399
love really are something like hate or apathy

115
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:57,080
nihilism and so it's sort of like yeah there's some details to be worked out but the path is

116
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:03,519
very clear so today

117
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:11,720
compassion compassion love in the face of dukka the wish that it be

118
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:20,839
alleviated and it's a love um infused with wisdom part of compassion is coming

119
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:28,720
to a more nuanced understanding of our suffering so often we

120
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,280
misdiagnose our pain our suffering and we tend to

121
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:44,440
embrace um single cause models you know like it's this it's the that person that

122
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:52,480
thing that tangle that pain but the truth is almost always more

123
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,040
complex so part of compassion is actually appreciating

124
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:05,280
uh Patia samua the dependent arising that that there's a very complex causal

125
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,720
webs that bring suffering to our heart if we get too simple if we make

126
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:21,520
the wrong diagnosis it sets us out on the course of the wrong treatment

127
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,280
approach and so we are developing wisdom

128
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,960
a of nuanced understanding of the nature of our own

129
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:46,000
suffering and um excuse me um so often so often we we want to uh

130
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,319
control our suffering rather than understand it and

131
00:35:53,319 --> 00:36:01,078
um compassion makes us peace patient in our

132
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,359
understanding for for um many

133
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:16,599
um the kind of gateway to compassion is is something like

134
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:22,440
um uh is mingled with grief with loss with

135
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:28,160
the changing of all things with anicha anicha

136
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:34,560
and um Katherine uh Schultz is so

137
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:40,680
um articulate on this I like to quote her so she writes

138
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:48,319
um uh and this is uh reflecting on on the death of her

139
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:57,079
father um she says um this is the essential avaricious nature of loss it

140
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:03,800
encompass purp is without distinction the trivial and the consequential the abstract and the

141
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:11,560
concrete the merely misplaced and the permanently gone we often ignore its true scope if

142
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:17,280
we can but for a while after my father died I could not s stop seeing the world

143
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:24,079
as it really is marked Everywhere by the evidence of past losses and the

144
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,720
imminence of future ones this was not because his death was a

145
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:36,720
tragedy my father died peacefully at 74 attended throughout his

146
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:44,119
final weeks by those he loved most it was because his death was not a

147
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:51,920
tragedy what shocked me was that something so sad could be the normal

148
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:58,480
necessary way of things in its aftermath each individual

149
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:05,880
life seemed to contain too much heartbreak for its fleeting duration history which I had always

150
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:12,240
loved even in its silences and Mysteries seemed like little more than a

151
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,200
record of loss at an epic scale especially where it could offer no

152
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:26,119
record at all the world itself seemed ephemeral glaciers and species and ecosystems

153
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,280
Vanishing the pace of change has Swift as in a

154
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:38,640
time lapse as if those of us alive today had be been permitted to see it from the

155
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:45,839
harrowing perspective of Eternity everything felt fragile everything felt

156
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:55,200
vulnerable the idea of loss pressed in all around me like a hidden order to

157
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,960
existence that emerged only only in the presence of

158
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:18,440
grief we take that in and uh what is there to do other than to

159
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:24,838
love wisely love knowing

160
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:33,400
change compass um it's not uh it's not an unmeshed love

161
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:39,680
it's not emotional contagion you know my my conditioning

162
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,560
around love is a kind of in mesed model you might say like

163
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:52,960
your pain is my pain is your pain love and space are somehow

164
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,359
intention rather than space affording room for love for a

165
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:07,880
compassion that um feels sustainable and so I found that

166
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:14,079
um that certain kinds of suffering suffering of loved ones can spin me in a

167
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:20,599
distinctive way where my words masquerade as compassion but are

168
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:28,240
actually an expression of my own intolerance of their pain and the impact

169
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:35,760
it has on my heart and that makes sense as um as

170
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,839
children the suffering of a parent or caretaker is not an opportunity for

171
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:47,839
compassion it's an existential threat our safety depends

172
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:54,680
entirely on their power and maybe those early formative

173
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:03,480
experiences encode some sense sense of fear in the face of the suffering of the

174
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:12,079
other but we remember compassion is not an insistence that someone change

175
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:20,440
and it's not it's not even in the insistence that someone stop

176
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:26,760
suffering it's love in the face of suffering

177
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:37,000
we're distilling out some of the compulsivity our own

178
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:46,400
intolerances compassion is not not empathy um affective empathy kind of

179
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:53,200
emotional empathy is feeling the the inner emotional life of the

180
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:59,200
other um and that that's maybe a comp opponent of

181
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:06,160
compassion but um but that's not but compassion the the

182
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:13,720
dimension of Love is Central if if it it's compassion

183
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:19,440
entails a willingness to grieve but that cannot be the last word

184
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,480
of our compassion grief cannot be the last word of our compassion there is

185
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,599
this sense of of a love that actually holds

186
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:37,559
it compassion's not a demand it's it's maybe it sometimes it

187
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:47,520
feels like um a prayer directed to who knows what some Sor don't know

188
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:55,078
but a kind of quiet prayer not a

189
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:01,119
demand and it's incredibly intimate

190
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:09,280
because your pity allows some space you know but

191
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:17,520
compassion compassion you're like truly undefended in the face of their

192
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:24,400
suffering and sometimes the insistence that their suffering is relieved is

193
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,680
merely another defense another way of blunting the full

194
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:38,960
impact sometimes the advice giving that we extend is merely another way to blunt

195
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:46,520
the full impact the intimacy of meeting suffering together

196
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:53,760
with love and to let suffering in

197
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,079
Deeply One must trust love deeply one must

198
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:04,160
trust that the last word of

199
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,480
pain is love

200
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,880
and as we'll get to I think in these Realms one must also

201
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:23,880
trust that other Brahma vihara UPA equinity

202
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,920
true love Tian says never makes you

203
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:44,240
suffer but um that means there that love needs a

204
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,839
lot of wisdom infused into

205
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:58,119
it that love needs to come from um a place of of real deep refinement in

206
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:05,920
ourselves as we practice we start to release our own pain and the pain of the

207
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:13,400
world ceases to resonate with our wounds but instead with our

208
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:21,640
heart when the pain of the world resonates with our wounds there's a kind of

209
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:27,800
Intolerable desperation around compassion and intolerance so suffering

210
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:34,599
when it resonates with our heart our love

211
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:41,839
becomes steady patient knowing the more free we become the more

212
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:49,960
potent our compassion becomes it is an emanation of our love

213
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:57,480
rather than our fear so I offer this for your

214
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:04,280
consideration and um uh yeah I appreciate the chance to um

215
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:14,720
reflect on these things with you and uh we'll be back tomorrow

216
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:20,599
Joy okay
