00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:07,040
warm greetings to our meditation time together

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,519
and as a way of introducing this meditation

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,800
i want to use as an analogy something i witnessed

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,080
some days ago at a local park there were some people who were flying

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,640
remote control airplanes little airplanes in the field

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,000
but one of them was a helicopter a little drone helicopter with four

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
propellers and i was just kind of it was zipping through the air and

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,399
flipping around and doing all kinds of things and it was actually kind of hard to follow its

9
00:00:52,399 --> 00:01:01,600
jagged path and it's kind of following it looking around and i felt a little bit discombobulated

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,400
trying to find it and looking for there it is now it's gone and it was zipping around and then at some

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,840
point it started to return back to

12
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,000
you know back where the person was who was controlling it and uh there was a clear spot on the

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,600
ground a little three four inch little disc that it was

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,159
going to land on and so it started coming in and it was easy to follow it and it kind of zipped back and forth a little

15
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:43,759
bit over around that disc kind of oh like then it was easy for me to watch and stay with it

16
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,920
and it's and then at some point it came right above the disc slow slow down slow down came right

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,439
above the disc and it hovered above the disc right above it and it was kind of delight to kind of

18
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,960
feel the delight and joyful to just see it hovering there and it was so

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,840
much more relaxing for my attention not to be searching for it in the sky and i was just there just watching it

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,520
hovers like my mind hovered and it was kind of like a little bit of a thrill to see it just a few inches above the

21
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,800
ground and then it just went straight down

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,800
on top of that disc and rested on the ground and something in my mind just rested ah

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,440
and the kind of thrill a little kind of excitement of just having it hover vanished my mind and i just my mind kind

24
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,159
of settled it's almost like my my mind got grounded oh

25
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,840
so i just see that the zoom folks didn't

26
00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:01,360
weren't hearing me because i had them to mute on so so those of you on

27
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:10,640
youtube hopefully you'll be patient with me and i tell this little story again and then we'll start going going going

28
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,319
again everyone welcome to the meditation

29
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:32,080
and i'd like to begin by a little analogy of what happened a

30
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,560
few days ago in a park where there was a people flying

31
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,959
remote control little airplanes over the field and there was one drone helicopter with

32
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,120
four propellers they were zipping around in the sky and it was a curiosity thing for me to see

33
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,519
it but it was very hard to follow was see it for a moment it would zip away and

34
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,200
a very jagged trajectory and path and so i was kind of busy my mom was kind of

35
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,560
active busy looking searching it was a lot of work at some point it

36
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,360
started the helicopter started coming back to where it was going to land and then i could start seeing it again

37
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,359
very easily without having to search for it and then it clearly was a spot in the

38
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:30,080
ground where it was going to land a little round disk and and i um

39
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,199
and then it was kind of like went back and forth a little bit looking to be close to that spot above

40
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,240
it and it's easy to watch it kind of glide and slide back and forth it was kind of nice to see it

41
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:54,080
it's little gentle movements and then it came to a place just a few inches above the disc and it was

42
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,479
completely still hovering in the air and it was such a pleasure to watch it hovers like

43
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:07,120
it was a little bit of a thrill like just kind of defying gravity just being really still just right there and i felt a certain

44
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,639
kind of joy and delight and my mind got really still like oh what's happening here

45
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,720
just kind of being still with that hovering and then the

46
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,759
the the helicopter just kind of landed on the ground and just was

47
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,680
atlantic got still subtle on the ground and i could feel my mind just get still

48
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:39,280
and the little bit of thrill or kind of the hovering feeling in my mind which was a little bit of energy rested

49
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,360
and my mind something in my mind ah and it rested there

50
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,720
so this is an analogy for samadhi for the development of this wonderful thing

51
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:58,720
called samadhi sometimes called concentration some translators

52
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:06,880
translated as serenity and and it's you know if you're if your

53
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,000
mind is a helicopter then sometimes your mind is zipping

54
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,880
around and it's hard to even find it wherever the mind goes it's trajectory is not so clear it jumps around

55
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:26,639
and so you know for a mindfulness practitioner it can be a lot of work kind of like where'd it go now and

56
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,680
finding it and keeping up with it and remembering to look for it and be

57
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,880
present but then as as we start getting settled

58
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,479
more more subtle than meditation the mind doesn't flit around so much

59
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,800
doesn't jump around so much and it begins to kind of still not quite in the present moment here

60
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,199
but maybe it's with the breathing some it's kind of in the territory and it's kind of a little bit moving back and forth

61
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:02,240
getting close in and out and sometimes there times i'm not but it doesn't go very far and you kind of know where the mind is

62
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,120
but it's just kind of looking for its landing spot and then at some point it's really there

63
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:16,720
in the present moment here in our experience in our body maybe with our breathing and it just

64
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,319
kind of a little bit hovering and it just feels so good to kind of to have a certain kind of stillness but

65
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:29,919
also to have a certain kind of well maybe i don't know if weightless feeling or hovering feeling of just

66
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:38,080
there but it's kind of a bit of a thrill and it's so nice a little bit wonderful and delightful

67
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,639
and then it's it doesn't go anywhere except it settles further down onto the

68
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:51,280
landing spot and for the mind to land here in the present moment a

69
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,840
landing spot on the ground where it's still peaceful

70
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,080
unmoving and then our mind just comes to our deep rest it just

71
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,280
rests there it's not searching for anything it's not chasing for anything

72
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,759
it's not bouncing around and even the even the delight of finally

73
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,360
just kind of being in a spot hovering is ah that settles as we come

74
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,560
to town and just up just here stillness quiet

75
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:32,318
peacefulness and settled here

76
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:40,080
and one of the descriptions of samadhi is a settledness of mind the mind is

77
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,720
settled and the deeper the subtleness is the stiller the mind comes

78
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:54,160
and a stillness that's not just a stillness of a particular spot within us

79
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,279
but as if everything is still because the awareness has become still

80
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,519
so assuming a meditation posture

81
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:16,399
that can be both your landing spot here in this body

82
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,839
and your helicopter your mind here

83
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,080
and if your mind is

84
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:38,240
dashing about after this thought and that thought just know that

85
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,640
you also have the remote control

86
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,839
to direct it back to its landing spot

87
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,200
gently lovingly still letting the mind know come back come back home

88
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:09,680
be here this is where rest is this is where safety is

89
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,480
don't need to flit around so much

90
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,320
and maybe one of the remote control signals for the mind to

91
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:30,000
settle down is taking a few long slow deep breaths

92
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,120
a deep breath about three quarters full without without any strain in the

93
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,600
in-breath and then an exhale that's maybe twice as

94
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,040
long as usual again without any strain

95
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:01,839
and exhale where there's more letting go at the end of the exhale

96
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:15,839
more release at the end of the exhale

97
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:47,360
and then letting your breathing settle down quiet down as if the breathing now can

98
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:57,839
begin landing here in your body

99
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:17,200
as you exhale softening and relaxing the body

100
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,600
and part of the relaxing of the muscles is to help the body come to a greater

101
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,319
stillness

102
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,760
as we soften the muscles of the face relax them

103
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:52,880
it's letting go of the activity of tension and holding

104
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:00,560
on the exhale relaxing the shoulders and if the shoulders are being held up

105
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:07,120
it's activity and action

106
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,480
that interferes with the deep settling into stillness

107
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:24,720
and the same thing with a belly softening relaxing the belly

108
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:32,839
and sometimes there you can feel the greater stillness sometimes not if it's difficult to be

109
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,839
relaxed

110
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:48,160
perhaps or some way to bring the entire body to stillness to relax let go

111
00:13:48,160 --> 00:14:03,839
in the hands the arms the chest the legs

112
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:16,639
and then to begin bringing the mind the awareness

113
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,000
home to the landing spot of the body breathing

114
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:34,880
and you might not quite be there yet might be close by you might fly by and come back and

115
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:42,319
circle around close to the breath but not quite there that's okay

116
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:58,240
that's that might be needed to kind of locate the place to land

117
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,800
you're with the breathing for a few breaths or half a breath off you go again

118
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,880
and rather than being discouraged be encouraged that

119
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,680
this is part of the process of coming to landing

120
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,600
and you are getting closer

121
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:37,440
maybe less off in the distant sky fleeting around coming here to your

122
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
breathing

123
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:54,079
and maybe for a while you hover over the breath almost as if

124
00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:01,519
the in-breath is a dr upward draft that you catch and kind of hovering in

125
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:08,320
gliding on

126
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,320
and the exhale is kind of a

127
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:23,839
provide support to glide along slide along on the exhale

128
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:19,438
and for the mind to really land in the breathing

129
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,600
the mind needs to become stiller

130
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:31,600
mind needs to be quieter which might be held by relaxing the

131
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:39,600
thinking mind relaxing any muscular tension

132
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:47,840
associated with thinking worrying and wanting

133
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:56,880
tension that might be in the forehead or behind it around the eyes or jaws

134
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:05,679
in a slight leaning forward or pulling being pulled or like pulling back

135
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:18,080
a more subtle relaxation of the body that corresponds to a settling of the

136
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,799
mind allows the mind to settle and get

137
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
quieter

138
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:49,280
and feeling more in the breathing the body breathing

139
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,480
and what would it be like for you to be right there with a breathing

140
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,480
hovering over it gently quietly

141
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:13,760
putting in just enough energy for your mind your attention

142
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,960
to hover over the in-breaths and out-breaths

143
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,760
so the mind is not wandering off and into thought so much but right there

144
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:39,840
breathing in and breathing out

145
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,080
and not so much like there's a laser focus like you're in the control tower looking

146
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:59,280
at the breathing but more like the whole body is

147
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:07,840
gently vibrating hovering over the breathing or with the breathing

148
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:21,840
right there breathing in and breathing out

149
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:35,840
they're kind of hovering where there's a stillness and a tranquility not a lot of movement

150
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,840
and then to let the mind

151
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:55,120
land in the breathing to land in the present moment

152
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,960
so that the engine can go off and

153
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:10,480
has deep stillness groundedness

154
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,799
safety having landed

155
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,919
and stable here on the ground of the body breathing

156
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,280
aground the earth

157
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,120
wide and expansive and quiet earth

158
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:47,120
where the mind can feel secure and enough to be still quiet

159
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:59,840
resting on the body breathing

160
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:42,559
whenever the mind is wandered off lot come back to first hovering with the

161
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:51,360
breath with breathing and then with a relaxation letting go

162
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:59,440
land on the breath land inside of it

163
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:06,880
come to a stillness of mind in the middle of the moving experience

164
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,840
of breathing

165
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,839
do

166
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,800
finding a place that of stillness within

167
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,680
and allowing the mind to become still

168
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:31,520
quiet maybe even unmoving

169
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:43,839
together with the inner stillness

170
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,839
so

171
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,519
and then coming to the end of this sitting

172
00:41:52,640 --> 00:42:00,839
and thinking about how samadhi operates in our interpersonal

173
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:08,960
relationships it is not a concentrated focus on others

174
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:18,079
but rather it's a deep settledness in ourselves

175
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:27,440
to be deeply settled without any fear

176
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,960
agendas without any leaning forward or pulling

177
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,480
back without being pushed by desires or

178
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:47,680
pulled by aversion just a deep subtleness

179
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,400
and to be with others in this settled way

180
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:02,960
so settled that of course you'll be aware of the other person

181
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:12,160
you don't need to intently focus of course you're open and available and

182
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:18,640
aware of the other and from this subtle place may be of

183
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,680
peaceful place

184
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:34,720
here there can be a kind of deep love and

185
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:43,680
positive regard and offering of goodwill of safety

186
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:52,079
a deep respect of others because you're not interfering with them

187
00:43:52,079 --> 00:44:00,880
or needing them to be different you're simply settled with them

188
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:08,079
settled on yourself

189
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,040
this settled samadhi factor

190
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,039
can give a wonderful perspective

191
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:27,760
for how to be with people with care with love with friendliness with good will

192
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:37,839
that is not so much work or an obligation or a transaction

193
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,760
it just is

194
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,079
it may be that our ability to be still in meditation

195
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:05,359
may it also be for the for the welfare and happiness of others

196
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:12,400
may all beings be happy

197
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:19,200
may all beings be safe

198
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:25,680
may all beings be settled in them on themselves

199
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:36,560
may all beings be nourished by an inner stillness and safety

200
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:47,839
may all beings know inner peace

201
00:45:48,079 --> 00:46:01,839
and may all beings everywhere be free

202
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,719
