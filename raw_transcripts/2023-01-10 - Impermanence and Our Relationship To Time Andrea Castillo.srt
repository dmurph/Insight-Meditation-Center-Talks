1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:07,020
uh so the topic for the The Talk today is generosity

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,799
and ethics as a prerequisites for meditation

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,460
and I found very interesting that in Reading one of the discourses of the

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:27,300
Buddha in the the one about the gradual training that he talks about these two qualities

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:36,079
as two qualities we want to begin with in our practice first to lay the foundation

6
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,059
before we begin to meditate

7
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,100
so we can say that these two qualities are the most basic ways to prepare

8
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,820
ourselves

9
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,699
generosity I see as a way to

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,060
it's like as if you were to take the Earth and start to loosen it up and then

11
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,780
the ethics is like pulling out the weeds all the things we don't need for then be able to plant something that will be

12
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,920
wholesome for us

13
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,020
so the Buddha made sure that his followers

14
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,500
had really had these two qualities well established before he taught them to

15
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,619
meditate but here in the west we we rush to begin

16
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:49,439
with meditation and many people have great difficulties with

17
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:57,180
it because we haven't done the Preparatory work and nowhere did I see it more clearly

18
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:04,860
than some years ago when I was working with sexual offenders that had just come

19
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:12,120
out of prison and I was to teach them meditation

20
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,819
it was really an eye-opening experience for me to see how tremendously difficult

21
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,860
it was for them it was painful for them and for me to

22
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,620
see what it took for them to sit quietly and have to face

23
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:36,780
themselves I remember a particular one one man who who just sit and after just a minute he

24
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,920
would just start sweating he could only sit for a couple of minutes it was just too difficult

25
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,420
now of course this is an extreme situation but I think that for us too

26
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,760
sometimes we have a hard time settling in because

27
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:04,560
we notice perhaps we were not kind with somebody or in some ways

28
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:12,560
we didn't follow what we know is an ethical way of living

29
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:24,840
so as we train ourselves with with ethics

30
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,440
is as if we are preparing ourselves to give the gift to others

31
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,659
of being harmless that's a very beautiful thing for other

32
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:44,700
people to feel safe with us and I want to although the training

33
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,640
begins with generosity in this talk I want to begin with uh with ethics

34
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,819
just because I want to leave the generosity at the end it's it's such a

35
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:02,239
sunny topic that I wanted to leave you with that at the end

36
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,760
so one one thing that I have noticed here in in the west is that

37
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:18,120
um with with a popularization of mindfulness often we have lost sight of

38
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,880
the connection of Mind mindfulness with the rest of the Dharma and specifically

39
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,639
of ethics and this is a real problem and a real loss

40
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,740
because then what the meditation and mindfulness ends up uh

41
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,259
being is just like a way to relax ourselves it's kind of like what I like

42
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:46,860
to call the Spy effect and yeah I mean it's nice and it's very positive to to have this relaxing effect

43
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:54,060
of the meditation but if we don't use it as a means to really

44
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,000
learn how to more and more free ourselves from suffering than the effect

45
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,580
of the relaxation is just going to last only as long as you know like a massage it's just you

46
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:17,720
know a little bit afterwards we fall into something that's unskillful and we we tense our whole self again

47
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,759
so as we train ourselves with ethics

48
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:35,100
we are training ourselves it's very important to make ourselves aware from

49
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,560
where it begins which is in our minds which is with with our thoughts

50
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,440
that's very important a lot of times these thoughts is where

51
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,020
this unwholesomeness begins and we notice that when they are already very well established

52
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:58,259
but if we catch them at the beginning we have much more of a chance that we'll be

53
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:03,360
able to pull them out stop them change

54
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,639
so we want to be able to train ourselves to watch our thoughts and then of course

55
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,360
our speaking and our actions

56
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:26,280
so the most succinct way that we can express ethics for us in in the context

57
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,919
of of the Dharma is um via an equation we can say ethics

58
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:39,240
equals happiness it's just as a simple you know to look at it that we are not

59
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:47,520
required to be ethical but that if we want to live uh a life that is

60
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:56,419
happy that we're Carefree that we need to work on our ethics

61
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,300
and so this is looked you know following these uh

62
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:10,160
General guidelines of an ethical life um

63
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,840
is seen as a logical and natural way to

64
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,740
um to have a happy life and they're just as natural as the laws of gravity you

65
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:29,280
know just like everything in our planet is subject to the law of gravity the same is true for us

66
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,340
when our thoughts and words and actions arise from a skillful place

67
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:42,120
then we will be happy and when they arise from greed hatred

68
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,699
and ignorance they will lead us to suffering

69
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:53,759
so the guiding principles that we have in the Dharma and that maybe some of you

70
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:02,720
already know the precepts you know this is just kind of like the most rudimentary way of

71
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,180
presenting some Guides of how to live our lives

72
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:16,440
but what we want to keep in mind is just because they are rudimentary it doesn't mean that we are Beyond it

73
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:24,960
you know sometimes we feel oh I know the precepts memorize them and Beyond them

74
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:32,820
but I think we all have to stop and rethink how is it that each one of these

75
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,459
precepts encompasses a whole range from something

76
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:45,660
very obvious and terrible to something quite subtle that

77
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,220
we can actually fall into easily

78
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:58,140
[Music] um and so we can look for example with the

79
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:04,980
first one you know refrain from from taking life I think when we hear this we all say oh

80
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:13,140
yeah yeah of course I don't I don't take anybody's life but how do we deal when we have a

81
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,240
problem of ants in our house you know that that's that's something

82
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,320
that happens to all of us or or mice or how do we deal with a situation of a

83
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:32,040
pet that is already very old do we consider euthani euthanasia for the pet

84
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,500
so there are these other issues that we really need to consider and the

85
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:43,800
wonderful thing about the way we work with the with the precept is that

86
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,860
they invite us they're an invitation for us to stop and be Discerning to really

87
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:56,399
look carefully the unique situation what are the components of this situation and

88
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,120
what is the wisest thing given the situation

89
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,800
and so the second one refrain from taking what has not been given

90
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,519
you know there's of course the obvious you know stealing something but then there's something that is very common

91
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:20,100
that people do that they are in the office and there there's there's a lot

92
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,860
of paper and you just take some paper home or some folders or um

93
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:33,120
often we don't think in those terms or sometimes with taxes you know people

94
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,480
are always kind of looking at ways of go around it and and perhaps not pay what

95
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:46,200
it is fair or one that the first time I heard it I

96
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:53,579
thought hmm I would have never thought about this as as taking something that is not given and that is arriving late

97
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:58,860
but it actually is one of those subtle ways that we're actually taking the time

98
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,860
of somebody else that maybe is waiting for us that was not given to us

99
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:11,640
so you see how it gets really interesting if if we take the time to really look at this and the more we

100
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,459
practice the more we become more sensitive to pick out these uh things

101
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:24,420
that make you want to be more precise more careful more subtle in your

102
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:31,680
decisions the third one refrain from causing harm with our sexuality

103
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:38,100
first of all I think that's a wonderful way of putting it the first time I heard it I thought wow what a what a

104
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:44,880
simple and Wise Way of being of talking about sexuality don't harm with your

105
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,540
energy with your Sexual Energy and so here of course

106
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:57,240
we know that one one obvious and and egregious one would be to impose

107
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:05,399
ourselves actually to somebody else but you know on the Other Extreme could be something like flirting you might

108
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,800
think that is very innocent but sometimes it actually can cause harm

109
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,680
another one would be the consuming of pornography you know

110
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,459
how does it make you feel to consume pornography

111
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:29,040
and then the fourth one refraining from speaking falsehoods there's of course the obvious you know

112
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,140
lying on purpose but uh then there's the other one that I

113
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:39,600
actually noticed in myself some years ago and that is that often we're telling a

114
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,600
story to friends we tend to exaggerate just a little bit and notice just to

115
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,300
make it a little more interesting and I said that's a good one to just kind of catch ourselves and say no I don't have

116
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:57,839
to do this you know just this really notice notice that

117
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,600
and then the last one of refraining from consuming alcohol or or drugs you know

118
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,200
which which we know you can really harm yourself and others if you do it unskillfully

119
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:16,860
um but then you know there's the the other more subtle that you drink a little and you get kind of goofy and and

120
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,399
uh maybe very entertaining but how easy it is to let some something come out

121
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:31,320
because your tongue is kind of loose and you let something come out that that can that can hurt somebody

122
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,660
so this is just in in general some of the things that we can think of

123
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:43,740
but I actually wanted to share with you uh one particular example that

124
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:51,300
um of a question that that was posed to me when when I was teaching a retreat

125
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,399
and I would say some years ago when George Floyd was murdered

126
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,160
I was teaching a retreat online and there was a latino man living in New

127
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,700
York who who told me look I'm somebody who have committed

128
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,980
to following the precepts but I have to tell you that

129
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:21,600
I don't feel safe in the streets anymore in New York you know he was somebody who who participated a lot in in racial uh

130
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,079
you know demonstrations and so he said

131
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,899
um I just don't feel safe and I want to buy a gun

132
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:40,260
what do you think so this is a very interesting question he said he had already made he hadn't

133
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:45,540
bought it but he already made all the the necessary paperwork that was needed

134
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:52,160
to to buy the gun and so

135
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,320
the interest what I find it's interesting that when when one is in the teaching position is that you cannot

136
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,459
take at the decision for somebody else somebody has everybody has to carry their own responsibility of their

137
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:11,100
decisions and so what I did was to say well why don't we just think together I'm going

138
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:17,180
to ask you some questions because the way I can help you is to help you

139
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:23,880
consider carefully and so some of the questions that I ask is what is your motivation

140
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:29,399
for having a gun and what attitude is behind that

141
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:35,699
motivation and then try to really imagine how would

142
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:40,800
you feel if you possess a gun

143
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:48,959
you had a gun at home or carried one with you also try to imagine how would you feel

144
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,899
if you actually had to use the gun

145
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,579
and how would it be to live with yourself the rest of your life if you

146
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:03,620
had to use the gun and you harmed somebody

147
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,579
or how would you feel if you were attacked and you didn't have the gun

148
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:18,660
and I also asked can can you think of another option where you don't cause harm

149
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:23,820
and you do manage to protect yourself because one of the things that I've

150
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:30,779
noticed when you really stop to think about it clarity

151
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:36,120
happens and somehow a creativity also arises

152
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,660
and you think of options in it that you hadn't even thought about it so you reframe it so maybe the

153
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:48,360
question is not going to be should I buy a gun but maybe the question is going to be

154
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,940
how could I protect myself in a way that is not non-harming

155
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:59,100
that's quite different isn't it and so so these questions we compose

156
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,438
ourselves these questions and then come up with

157
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:11,360
a more refined way of asking ourselves

158
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:21,900
the first time I heard this I was I was very intrigued and that is that when you

159
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:29,400
follow rules rigidly or ethical principles rigidly you don't mature

160
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,880
but yeah that makes total sense right because if you follow them rigidly you're not stopping to really consider

161
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,100
how do I stand how do I stand with this how how do I

162
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,280
really what what is what is my attitude towards this

163
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:56,940
because sometimes we're going to find in situations where breaking the precepts is the right thing to do

164
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:03,120
but when that when that situation happens then there are two things we have to keep in mind

165
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,960
one is to be very aware what is the attitude that you have as

166
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,419
you break the precept is it benevolent have you come to the

167
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:21,240
conclusion in this particular situation this is the most benevolent thing I can do

168
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,539
and you also realize that you are going to carry some Karma

169
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:35,520
With It because there will be some consequences but if you took that decision

170
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:41,120
based on this is the wisest and the most benevolent option

171
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:48,260
then consequences won't be that bad for you

172
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:56,280
and the last thing I want to say about about ethics is something that I heard from from

173
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:02,820
Kamala Masters this wonderful teacher that has a center in Maui she puts it in

174
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,980
such a positive way when she talks about ethics she says we're dealing either

175
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,260
with purification or purifying

176
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:18,419
and so what she means is that when you

177
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:23,520
are being Mindful and you check in with yourself and you notice right now there

178
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,860
are no unskillful mind States so

179
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:37,140
I haven't broken any precepts so that means right now there is purification there is purification in me

180
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:44,160
but what about if you stop and notice and you are assailed

181
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:51,539
with some of the obstacles you know with greed or you're or sloth

182
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:58,440
and torp or whatever it's present then you begin to work with them

183
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,660
and there are many ways that many tools that we can use to know how to work with

184
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:09,120
them and then what's happening then then purification is happening

185
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,880
and so we can see that that this keeps us engaged we are

186
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:22,620
looking at the reality of what's going on but it's in a very positive way it there's either purification present or

187
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,440
we're in the process of purifying

188
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:37,039
so that's as far as that's all I want to say as far as ethics

189
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,720
and now going on to generosity or Donna

190
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,820
is a topic that I like very much to talk about

191
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:56,280
so generosity implies giving myself of myself to others whether material or

192
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:02,840
immaterial Goods such as my time or my attention

193
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,919
and we can say that generosity is not just an isolated event of giving something to someone but is a quality

194
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:16,100
that we want to cultivate and embody

195
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:26,520
and so generosity of spirit can be expressed in many wonderful ways it can be expressed in a smile

196
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:33,600
it can be expressed it's really listening to somebody it can be expressed in just saying thank you to

197
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:40,799
somebody or it can also be expressed as not judging ourselves mercilessly when we

198
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,320
notice that we've done something wrong

199
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:54,780
when we give wisely we're told in the Dharma that we

200
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:01,220
experience Joy before during and after

201
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:08,159
and if you've paid attention when you've given in a wise way it is so much the

202
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:15,419
case practicing generosity is a wonderful way of having access to Joy

203
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:21,059
at any time and

204
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:27,780
in Asian countries generosity is something that is practiced

205
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:34,679
and taught to little children while still in arms are taught how to

206
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:40,020
offer even if it's just a handful of rise to the monks who come and ask

207
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:48,059
for food I also found interesting that in Burma when it's your birthday

208
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:54,840
you don't give birth you you you don't receive presence but you give presents

209
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:01,740
which is such a wonderful thing I actually just had the experience a couple of years ago of a dear friend of

210
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:08,480
mine who turned 90 and she asked us all don't bring presents in what she did

211
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,580
was to give each one of us in her party

212
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:20,460
a book of her best poems that she had written in the last 30 years

213
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:28,700
it was such a beautiful gesture of sharing something so meaningful it's kind of of the Harvest of her life

214
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:38,940
and so we all practice generosity in in different ways some

215
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,840
for some of us it comes more natural and for others not so natural

216
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:52,020
um but what is really wonderful in the way that

217
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:58,460
the Buddha taught is that he was such a fantastic teacher and he always

218
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,659
knew who he had in front of him and how he was going to teach them

219
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:09,659
and there is one way that he he taught generosity generosity I think it's

220
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:16,140
wonderful it assures that you will succeed and the teaching is very simple

221
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:22,100
the teaching is that you take one stone with your right hand

222
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:32,159
and you put it on your left hand okay I think this we can we can all do and it basically is getting the feel of

223
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:39,299
this idea of how renunciation is related to generosity in

224
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:44,340
order for this hand to receive the stone this one has to let go of it so it's

225
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:49,860
just a very simple thing it's imagine that we can teach that to a child

226
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:57,960
you know something very simple where a child can feel very very good about himself or herself

227
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:05,779
and then go on later to share something that's much harder like to share a toy

228
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:15,720
when um we feel the impetus to

229
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,000
to be generous we're told in the Dharma follow that impetus

230
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,620
and so the last thing I wanted to to share with you is an experience that I had not that

231
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:35,520
long ago um where I was able to see a series of

232
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:42,360
very beautiful generous gestures that made a big big difference for for

233
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:49,860
somebody um so last November I had the Good Fortune

234
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:57,299
to visit an indigenous community of the guambianos in the Colombian Andes

235
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:03,840
and our last day as we were leaving the town closest to the reservation

236
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:10,320
I got to talking to an indigenous woman it was like she was a grandmother and

237
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,779
she was there with her little granddaughter and she was wearing you know her

238
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:24,140
traditional gambiano clothing which is this long Woolen black skirt and this royal blue kind of a shawl in this

239
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,520
fedora hat and

240
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:36,480
she told me she needed help to carry a rather big and heavy sack of potatoes

241
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:43,500
that she herself had planted and harvested she needed to get this enormous act onto the bus

242
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,539
so a dear friend that was traveling with us was strong enough to lift it for her

243
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:54,900
and she was very very happy and once in the bus we just sat together

244
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,360
and and we continued talking so it turns out that this woman was

245
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,460
traveling like us all the way to the city of Kali

246
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:12,260
but her reason for traveling was rather sad because she was

247
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:18,539
traveling to the city to visit her daughter or the little girl's mother in the

248
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:23,640
hospital who was very ill now there's

249
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:30,179
lovely grandmother had arranged for somebody to buy her potatoes in the next

250
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:36,179
town where we were going to stop and she was doing that in order to have

251
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:42,480
enough money for the trip so as we arrived to the next town the

252
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,740
person who was supposed to buy the potatoes from her was not there

253
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:55,020
and she explained to the bus driver

254
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:00,960
that what what happened and asked him would you please wait for me to see if I

255
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:09,059
can get somebody else to buy the potatoes now try to imagine this situation

256
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:17,179
in this country or in any City I should say

257
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:23,159
but where I was in the area of this guambianos they have a very very strong

258
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:28,860
community and they really they have a sense of belonging and they really help

259
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:34,740
each other so the bus driver somehow recognized The

260
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:41,520
Plight that this poor woman was in and waited and much to my amazement not there was

261
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,700
not one person in the bus that complained so we were about 30 people we all just

262
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:53,760
quietly sat in the bus and waited and somehow miraculously the woman was

263
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,580
able to sell her potatoes and not you know didn't take that long I don't remember how long but it wasn't that

264
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:05,159
long so then let next leg of the of the trip

265
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,919
because it was a pretty long trip I sat next to the five-year-old and

266
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:16,200
and decided to share with her some of the the things I

267
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,720
remember from sharing with my son when he was little so

268
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,240
when I ran out and some of the the songs that I knew in in Spanish I I actually

269
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:34,559
even translated a rather or improvised a rather questionable version of The Wiggles and the bus but she loved it and

270
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,840
she the the grandmother sang along and did the hand movements and so there we

271
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:48,480
are in the bus doing our our singing and so in the next in the next stop she

272
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,820
goes off with a grandmother to get to get some food and the bus happened to to

273
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,919
stop right in front of a of a stationary store a very little humble looking

274
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,260
stationary store and I somehow

275
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:09,440
had the subtle sudden impulse to get off

276
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,179
and and I thought it would be very nice to get this little girl a present

277
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:23,240
so I walked into the the stationary store and was able to find a very nice box of colored pencils and a little

278
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:30,179
notebook with blank pages for her to draw on so made it back to the boss and and once

279
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:37,500
once they also returned I presented it to to the little girl and her eyes just

280
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:43,260
got so big and she just was actually I love to draw

281
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:49,679
and she was just caressing the box of pencils and it was just so it was just so happy

282
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,700
so it got dark and it got very quiet and as

283
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:04,380
far as I knew she had gone to sleep and suddenly I see this little hand that

284
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:11,399
went up she was sitting in front now in front of me and this is the backrest and I see this little hand that goes up and

285
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:16,740
she was doing like this with her fingers as if it was like a little bug that was looking for something

286
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:22,020
and so with my hand I went like this and started to go on the other in the other

287
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:27,360
direction when she felt my hand she just took my hand I could I couldn't see her

288
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:34,320
face and she just held it and so most of the trip to gali

289
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:42,960
we just sat there in silence and she held my hand it was such a beautiful simple way of

290
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,320
her to say thank you and so as soon as we got into the city

291
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:55,559
of Kali they they got off we said goodbye as

292
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:03,000
as if we were old friends and there was a real sense in my heart

293
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,600
that what the woman and the little girl had received from several people during the

294
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,380
day was going to help them or carry them

295
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:23,399
through the difficulty of encountering the Heavenly messenger of illness once

296
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:30,179
they were in the hospital so just this remembering you know just

297
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:35,820
this little gestures that we can do for each other of kindness of

298
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:41,340
generosity that can make such big difference

299
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:47,460
and so to finish I wanted to share a poem with you

300
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:54,179
by Rosemary watola trummer is called what it might con how it might continue

301
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:59,399
and for me this poem kind of captures this idea of us being able to do

302
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:06,059
something for somebody else that might seem like it's minor that it doesn't not

303
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:14,120
that doesn't really change much but that inside something important happens

304
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:21,179
wherever we go the chance for joy whole Orchards of amazement

305
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:27,659
one more reason to always travel with our pockets full of exclamation marks

306
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:33,899
so we might scatter them for others like apple seeds some will dry out

307
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:42,000
some will blow away but some will take root and grow exuberant Groves filled with

308
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,640
long thin fruits that resemble one hand clapping so much enthusiasm as they

309
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,740
flutter back and forth that although nothing's heard and though nothing's

310
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:59,460
really changed people everywhere for years to come will swear that the world

311
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:08,299
is ripe with Applause will fill their own Pockets with new seeds to scatter

312
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,559
so let us close our eyes for a moment

313
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:36,079
and just allowing the words that you've heard

314
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,878
on generosity and ethics

315
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:51,839
allow them to come in to your heart

316
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,800
to your mind

317
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:50,280
and may the words that you've heard today benefit yourselves

318
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,800
and every person that you come in contact with

319
00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:04,140
thank you for your attention and we have a couple minutes if anybody has

320
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,940
a question or a comment

321
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,040
good we feel complete so I thank you all

322
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:30,319
be well and a good evening to all
