00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,139
[Music]

3
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,729
[Music]

4
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,129

5
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,909
[Music]

6
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:29,519
so good day and i offer this greeting as partly as a sound check and let's see if

7
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:43,839
a few of you could say do you hear me

8
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,839
um

9
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,600
wonderful it's wonderful to be here with all of you and

10
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,839
to share this time and

11
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,839
so the general topic for last week and this week is

12
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,839
the general topic for this week and next week is um

13
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,480
uh

14
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:41,200
kusala it's a poly word and um often translate into english as wholesome

15
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,320
and for this meditation i want to use that translation the other one is

16
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,360
skillful and and that mindfulness is

17
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:58,160
understood to be a wholesome practice and

18
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:05,200
and it's sometimes said that mindfulness of the buddhism mindfulness of the body brings with it or includes within it all

19
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,959
the wholesome qualities of mind and heart that a person could have and that's

20
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,320
quite a powerful statement about the value of mindfulness of the body that

21
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:25,440
it just seems to be all good in some certain kind of way or promotes what's really good the um

22
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,839
so meditation practice is meant to be wholesome healthy conducive to health and

23
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,959
nourishment and when we sit down to meditate we bring with us our minds

24
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:45,440
and our minds uh are variable quite you know it's very variable and

25
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,680
and contains a lot of different things in it and some of it is

26
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,440
some of it is

27
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,279
you know not so wholesome not so beneficial for us or for the world

28
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,320
around us and and that you know

29
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,880
that's the way it is sometimes but the practice of meditation the practice

30
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,000
of mindfulness is different than the

31
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,639
momentum the tendencies the variability of what lives in there in the mind our mind the

32
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,399
idea is that mindfulness is wholesome or we

33
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,920
and the simple act of being present and it is to bring this wholesome

34
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,120
engagement with even what's unwholesome that's our job is to bring the wholesome

35
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,000
or be wholesome in the engagement we have and one of the simplest ways for to do this

36
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,440
that doesn't require us dredging up good qualities or being wholesome in some kind of even some kind of

37
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,120
artificial way or some forced way is a very simple

38
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:12,240
practice of mindfulness no matter how it's practiced to have this clear mindfulness of the

39
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,320
moment just oh that's what's happening that's what's happening but in particular mindfulness of

40
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,399
breathing i think of mindfulness is the breathing as being a place where things begin

41
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,480
working themselves out a place where we begin

42
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,639
finding or adjusting or relaxing into having a wholesome

43
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,839
attitude wholesome approach to the meditation practice

44
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,800
just like just settling in with the breathing and then we begin being able to meet all the different

45
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:56,320
parts of the mind including the parts of the mind which are not so exemplary or which have a lot of

46
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,880
suffering in them or struggle or conflict in them and hold them in a attention which is

47
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:09,519
kind which is supportive which is wholesome so as we do this meditation don't worry

48
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,880
too much about any unwholesome tendencies you have any painful

49
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:22,639
trains of thought you have and um any negative self-judgments you have

50
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,399
don't just simply don't try to be involved in them but don't try to stop them either

51
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,839
there can be simple letting go but just keep coming back to mindfulness of

52
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,800
breathing and finding how to have this wholesome awareness of everything including of

53
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,880
what is unwholesome so

54
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,680
entering into a supportive meditation posture

55
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,520
and gently closing your eyes

56
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,839
and slowly

57
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,199
gently taking a few long deep breaths

58
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:34,960
breathing in deeply and relaxing as you exhale

59
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,840
breathing in

60
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,240
and softening on the exhale

61
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,840
letting your breathing return to normal

62
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:15,520
and going through your body and relaxing on the exhale

63
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,760
relaxing letting go as you

64
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,559
softening in the face

65
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:57,840
as you exhale softening in the shoulders

66
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,679
as you exhale softening the belly

67
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,039
sometimes a good softening of the belly will also soften

68
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,840
the shoulders

69
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:42,159
softening the belly can also involved softening of the whole lower torso

70
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:53,840
relaxing into the seat if you're sitting

71
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:06,400
and then gently calmly letting your awareness

72
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:21,840
meet the body's experience of breathing

73
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,840
and as we continue this meditation

74
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:12,000
gently relaxedly see if you can have a wholesome

75
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,400
attitude in being mindful of breathing

76
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,679
wholesome in that it maybe has a quality of

77
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
caring

78
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,760
or acceptance

79
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
gentleness

80
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,720
perhaps it's not so ambitious greedy for

81
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,559
it to be a certain way expectations but an attitude which is

82
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:13,039
more generous to how it is a willingness to trust the simplicity of

83
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:19,679
breathing in and breathing out allowing the breathing

84
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,120
to be the pathway to a more settled wholesome state of

85
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:33,360
mind that comes as we settle relax into

86
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,400
just breathing not being so troubled by the variability

87
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,760
of the mind just beginning again and again with your

88
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,720
breathing trusting

89
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,840
mindfulness of breathing

90
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,819
[Music]

91
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:28,080
in what way would trusting breathing trusting mindfulness of

92
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:35,840
breathing shift things for you in a more wholesome

93
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
direction

94
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:56,799
and wholesome means partly it means nourishing

95
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,840
if you feel the nourishing quality of meditation

96
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,840
might that help you to stay present

97
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,369
[Music]

98
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,729
[Music]

99
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,920
you

100
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,599
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

101
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:33,279
an expression of a wholesome state of mind heart

102
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:39,440
are things like generosity and care compassion

103
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:46,400
kindness and concern and care for the welfare of

104
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,599
others and then there's this wonderful movement

105
00:39:53,599 --> 00:40:00,160
called dedication of merit where on one hand we dedicate all the

106
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:06,960
benefits that we've received from our meditation practice

107
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:13,359
for the welfare and happiness of others but because this is an act of generosity

108
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:19,920
and care it generates more merit great merit

109
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,560
or to say it differently if we dedicate the benefit of this meditation for the sake of

110
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:31,280
others we benefit as well

111
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:39,440
we don't end up with less benefit we end up with more

112
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:46,240
so may it be that this meditation practically done on this

113
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:53,599
first day of the week may it spread benefit out into the world

114
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:59,599
for the rest of the week wherever we go whoever we talk to

115
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:07,280
whoever we think about may we do so with greater care

116
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:15,760
and concern for their welfare may this practice we've done today

117
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,839
support us in spreading kindness

118
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:32,078
welfare and happiness out into the world may all beings be happy

119
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:41,920
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

120
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:49,839
and may all beings everywhere be free

121
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:23,920
so the topic continues to be on wholesomeness skillfulness

122
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:30,160
there's a single poly word that we we use we translate into english in

123
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:37,280
both these ways the pali word is kusala k-u-s-a-l-a

124
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:45,359
and um probably is seen as a maybe an ancient ancient

125
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:51,200
buddhist world had a singular meaning in that time but it just happens to be that

126
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:57,680
in english it seems like the two primary meanings that are translations that we've come to

127
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:03,280
settled on now is wholesomeness wholesome and skillful

128
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,560
and then the opposite is unwholesome and unskillful

129
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:14,960
um some of it depends on the context of um

130
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,880
in which the term is being used it seems that and things that have an interpersonal

131
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:27,760
relationship interpersonal nature relation relating to other people for example or

132
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,880
maybe relating to ourselves as if we're another person then wholesome seems to be

133
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:41,599
the better translation but when it has to do with uh personal spiritual development uh

134
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,640
personal meditation development to make meditation want meditation practice

135
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:55,680
then it seems like a better translation is skill and the

136
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:04,480
and so wholesomeness has the idea in english

137
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,720
of uh something which is nourishing something which is healthy the

138
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:18,480
dictionary definition that i've seen is promoting health and well-being of mind spirit and body whereas

139
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:25,440
skillfulness has to do with proficiency at the one's ability to do something well

140
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:32,800
and the wholesomeness can imply the goodness of

141
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,160
something in and of itself just doing it is its own reward because just feels so good to

142
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,440
do whereas skillful has a little bit more sense that um

143
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:50,079
there's you're doing it for something for a purpose and it supports a purpose it might support the growth of wholesome

144
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:56,720
qualities growth of what's good but still it's skillful for a purpose so and so you say you know

145
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,400
this is skillful you can ask for what purpose or in what way

146
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:08,960
and so these these distinctions are not so absolute but there's a tendency to be kind of divide

147
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,160
these two different uh translations one is has to do with

148
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,240
interpersonal and the other real personal development and one has to do with um

149
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:28,000
with promoting health and well-being in a direct way for oneself

150
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,440
with wholesome qualities to acting on the wholesome and acting on the ways that benefit other people

151
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,280
uh if it's done wholesomely it's nourishing supportive form here

152
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,400
according to this translation um conducive promoting moral

153
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,838
promoting health or well-being of mind spirit and body

154
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:57,838
it's interesting that another definition of wholesomeness in dictionary is conducive to or promoting

155
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,119
moral well-being and so this particularly has to do with the how kusala sometimes refers this

156
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,400
interpersonal relationship in fact the word kusala is probably the closest

157
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:16,160
match for the english word moral or ethics but rather than having

158
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:23,359
some kind of authoritarian feeling or moral obligation feeling around the word

159
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:29,440
the concept it has this kind of warm i for me this warm internal feeling of

160
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:36,839
upswilling upswelling of what is nourishing supportive this good within us so it has an inner

161
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:42,400
source for ethics rather than external source of right and wrong should and shouldn't

162
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,760
and all that and so to keep using this wholesome inner experience

163
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:55,119
to be connected to that to know it in a way that can be uh eclipsed

164
00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:02,480
if we're too much caught up in the cognitive ideas of um the you know the abstract ideas of

165
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:08,720
what is and isn't ethical what we should and shouldn't do what is right and wrong coming from our

166
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:16,000
society or from religious textbooks or of all kinds of sources that are very different than

167
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,280
this welling up of a reference point inside of what really feels

168
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:27,119
nourishing healthy that's different than using the

169
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:34,400
experience of pleasure as a reference point if it's simply what we enjoy what brings pleasure then we might go ask you might

170
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,480
go astray a little bit but if we use what's wholesome i think the buddhist ideas

171
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:47,359
that's a really reliable reference point for ensuring that we act well in the world

172
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:55,520
generously in the world so staying for a moment with a little bit with this translation of wholesome

173
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:02,880
um and that it has to do with the interpersonal world probably the most common reference to

174
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,160
this wholesome quality in terms of our relationship to other people in this

175
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:15,520
in the teachings of the buddha have to do with a list of 10 ethical guidelines

176
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:23,440
that are called the 10 courses 10 practices of

177
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:31,119
wholesome action and the opposite are the 10 courses of unwholesome action and

178
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:37,280
uh and there were action here is karma so of wholesome karma and unwholesome karma

179
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,800
and um and uh and because the word kusala wholesome is

180
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:49,040
there these 10 kind of looks like precepts maybe shouldn't be seen as maybe as

181
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:56,839
precepts in some of the associations we have the word they are more like the 10

182
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:03,599
wellsprings of wholesome actions that we can that we can act on and live live by

183
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:08,640
so these ten in in uh there's a longer description of each one in the suttas

184
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:15,040
but uh for now i'll say the ten are not killing not stealing not taking what

185
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:24,160
is not given not engaging in sexual misconduct not lying not speaking maliciously

186
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:32,000
not speaking harshly not speaking frivolously not having

187
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,839
not being avaricious and not having ill will

188
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:43,920
and and having a right view the skillful view and

189
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:49,760
understanding and one of the skillful views is to distinguish primordus wholesome and

190
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:55,119
unwholesome one of the skillful views and understandings is to understand how to come from

191
00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:02,400
what is wholesome as we engage in our life and so these they're mostly

192
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:08,720
talking about what not to do but it turns out that not doing killing stealing sexual

193
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:14,800
misconduct lying and so forth um just clears the decks in a sense

194
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:21,200
for what's in there the wholesome to come out it also provides a tremendous sense of

195
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:27,119
safety and room for other people to thrive and to do well

196
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:32,480
in the way in a way that if we kill and steal and hurt people through our sexuality

197
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:38,559
doesn't allow the best in other people to come out as well violence against others

198
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:45,839
and and hostility against other meanness to others can clamp close people down or

199
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:52,160
cause challenges for people in a community for you know really for centuries it was

200
00:51:52,160 --> 00:52:00,480
very touching to read about the survivors of the tulsa massacre who went to congress recently

201
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:07,920
today is the 100th anniversary of that massacre and uh so if someone who's 107 years old

202
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,359
coming and speaking about the legacy of what happened a hundred years ago that

203
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:19,520
violence and how every day of her life every night of her life she relives and is you know troubled by

204
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:27,040
what happened to her for 100 years that's a long time and so the impact of our negative

205
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:32,640
actions are huge and but what we're trying to do is to

206
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:38,559
live a wholesome life and i for me that's a very different feeling than living an ethical life

207
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:44,160
a wholesome life just feels like it's um um you know just you know wholesome it's

208
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:49,520
just it feels good it's relaxing it's softening it's warm warm

209
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:56,720
warm heartening for ourselves and so this um idea of

210
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,400
wholesome examples of what's most wholesome are these ten

211
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:08,000
wholesome actions and they have um there's as i said there's a long

212
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,520
description by paragraph long description of each one and i'll give you an example of the

213
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:22,160
first one you get a sense of it's actually relatively short compared to the others

214
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:31,280
abandoning killing of living beings one abstains from killing living beings

215
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:39,359
with weapons laid aside gentle and kindly one abides

216
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:46,240
compassionate to all living beings so here we have uh it's not just a

217
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,440
matter of avoiding killing there's also this

218
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:58,160
positive wholesome qualities that are being encouraged here and and being allowed to

219
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:05,440
develop and grow and so it's not just simply a a prohibition for something it's because

220
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,480
it's focusing on what's wholesome it says yes and these beautiful qualities as well

221
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:16,880
let's live by them as well with weapons laid aside a gentle and

222
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:24,559
kindly one abides compassionate to all living beings the um uh

223
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:32,800
in abstaining from militia speech one reunites those divided

224
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:40,640
and promotes friendship and unites those who are not yet united in avoiding her speech

225
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,680
speech one speaks gently and courteously

226
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,880
in abstaining from frivolous speech one speaks by what is factual

227
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:57,040
and useful and abstaining from ill will when

228
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:03,040
one wishes others that they be free of affliction

229
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:09,760
so this these these ten wholesome qualities and these get listed talked about over

230
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:15,200
and over again the suit as much more as my impression than the five precepts and it seems that

231
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:22,000
in the suttas in the teachings of the buddha these ten skillful actions while they overlap with the five precepts

232
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,599
they're richer and more heartfelt in in nature in terms of these positive

233
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:33,280
qualities and but more importantly they're presented also

234
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,559
as important stepping stones in the path to liberation

235
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:44,880
whereas the five precepts have a lot of benefit but they're not so directly tied to the

236
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:51,520
purposes for liberation the purposes are to create a better society and help the other people feel safe and not

237
00:55:51,520 --> 00:56:02,319
create bad karma for ourselves things like that and and so um

238
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:05,200
and so um

239
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:17,119
the um so the ten courses of

240
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:23,359
wholesome action that lead to both liberation but also the growth

241
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:29,760
of wholesomeness in ourselves and what a wonderful thing to do what a wonderful thing to

242
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:35,440
do with one's life is to develop wholesome qualities that support others and protect others

243
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,640
and for the benefit of others and um

244
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:48,000
and right on the path to liberation what a nice thing that these two things coincide

245
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:57,280
so um that is um uh so the ten courses of skillful

246
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:05,280
or wholesome actions are found repeatedly in the pseudos and the in the middle length discourses

247
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,559
i see there's a note asking the source it may be relatively easy place to find

248
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:18,720
if those you have the have access to it the middle length discourses in discourse 9 has a

249
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:25,119
has a list of them but i don't know if it's a full list the full description the full

250
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:30,240
description might be in something like um

251
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:38,960
um in the middle length discourse 39 or 40 something like that so

252
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:55,839
so um thank you and uh may your day be wholesome

253
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,880
you
