1
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:09,179
so hello everyone and welcome to this uh

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:16,080
last talk on the aspirations connected to Compassion or the meditation connected to it

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:24,779
and um and uh more deeply than a

4
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:34,520
love and appreciation and Devotion to the value of compassion

5
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:42,120
is a love dedication Devotion to something that's deeper that I like to

6
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:50,219
believe that is the source of compassion within us and one maybe a simplistic way of saying

7
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:58,140
it is um because it can be so easily misunderstood or so easily

8
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,860
seen in a simplistic kind of surface way is that the source of

9
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,060
genuine healthy maybe even healing compassion

10
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:18,720
is being ourselves fully and and but in some deep way and another

11
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,000
way of saying this is um to maybe appreciate maybe the

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,080
profundity of that statement is that it's really uh uh letting go completely

13
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,259
of our normal senses of self and letting something deeper within us

14
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:42,200
move us something deeper within us um

15
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,240
the Dharma work through us and what is it that is so deep within us

16
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,659
that we can trust and allow it to unfold whatever is there let in the unfolding

17
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:04,500
and I one way of saying it in a maybe a less dharmic way is that um life knows

18
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:12,920
how to bring life forth life knows how to Let's the the fullness of it of life

19
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,860
flow forth in any kind of situation if we can let life flow in a healthy

20
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:28,739
harmonious a way so for ourselves

21
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:34,140
to trust that there's some deep movement towards Health not always physical

22
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:41,040
health because we're all die at some point but um but some deep uh

23
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,980
heart health some deep spiritual health some deep psychological health

24
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:54,060
that where um something wants to be born something

25
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:01,800
wants to be healed something wants to come to homeostasis something doesn't want to be

26
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,220
um stressed or in pain or in suffering and it's a movement to freedom from

27
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:19,260
suffering for sure and to trust this deeper thing that that doesn't require us even to

28
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,540
generate compassion to live within a sense of obligated you have to live a compassionate life

29
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:32,760
but rather there's this deeper Source that's what we want to live and from that comes compassion at the in

30
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,360
the situations that it's appropriate for so I offer that in the beginning of this meditation

31
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,659
that one of the values of lessening quieting discursive thoughts

32
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:50,760
being attuned to ourselves in a deeper way than discursive thinking

33
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:57,900
that there there can be um so there's there's something very

34
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,799
significant the Dharma our heart life that's kind of wants to come out in

35
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,860
a full harmonious balanced way and we might be far from that because of

36
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:17,100
all the challenges of our lives and and complexities of our psychology and all

37
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:23,220
kinds of things but it's waiting for us and so to drop below the discursive mind

38
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:30,780
and begin attuning yourselves or sensing something deeper is one of the possibilities of meditation

39
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:38,000
so with that beginning we'll begin with meditation

40
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,600
so to assume a a meditation posture

41
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:53,040
where there's respect for that posture a care it's a posture that we take

42
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:01,979
to allow ourselves to be better attuned better aware better more space for

43
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:07,520
something really to show itself from within

44
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,900
and a posture that focuses too much on relaxation

45
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,960
where we kind of give up kind of a certain degree of

46
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:24,780
Vitality of sitting upright or being clear or engaged or intentful

47
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:32,660
might not allow the full unfolding the opening of this deeper dimension

48
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:39,600
it's almost as if we want to be have the body have some degree of alertness

49
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,080
so that the very places that the body is alert and engaged is a place where

50
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,440
something can begin to flow and move and develop

51
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,240
and then to gently close your eyes

52
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,599
and take a few long slow deep breaths

53
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,320
and the fact that your body has been breathing for a lifetime now

54
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:16,020
mostly without your directing it to do so

55
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:22,319
means the breathing is connected to this deeper

56
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:31,100
care and health of movement of life within us

57
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,080
letting your breathing return to normal

58
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:44,660
and attuning yourself to the body breathing

59
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:53,720
relaxing into the body breathing

60
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,100
and if the focus on breathing means you immediately get engaged and work at it

61
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,139
or get tense or something

62
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:16,319
imagine that you're stepping back away from your breathing almost like you're observing the breathing

63
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,720
in your back rib cage or if you're observing your breathing from

64
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,300
behind so there's not interfering with

65
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:35,300
breathing but discovering how breathing breathe itself as itself

66
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,840
relaxing around the body breathing

67
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:13,099
relaxing around your breathing in wider circles so more and more of your body

68
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,720
is softening relaxing

69
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,000
into the breathing

70
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,200
allowing your thinking mind also to soften and relax

71
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,860
in the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

72
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,200
and maybe seeing if you can switch an orientation

73
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,040
away from being interested or involved in discursive thought

74
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:24,320
it's an orientation towards a quieter deeper place within

75
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:33,480
a quieter attention a softer awareness breathing body of

76
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,899
what's here

77
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,040
there's a way of attention being soft and

78
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,899
attentive present to our body

79
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,820
to the quieter places within

80
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,899
that's making room for whatever is here

81
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:23,420
making room for whatever wants to unfold whatever wants to show itself

82
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,279
whatever wants to be born

83
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,440
and whatever is occurring

84
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,839
is okay if

85
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:59,579
the awareness is soft enough broad enough wide enough

86
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:06,019
to allow it to be there without picking it up participating

87
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:09,500
reacting to it

88
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,880
fighting it or holding on to it

89
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:26,880
without expectations or wants just allowing what's there to be itself

90
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,540
on a path to in a deep way allowing you to be

91
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,839
yourself

92
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:12,019
where life where our wholeness knows how to bring itself forth

93
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:24,140
and our role is the quiet non-discursive awareness

94
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,100
maybe with which we know and make space and to feel

95
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,839
a deeper Attunement

96
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,019
to the life flowing through us

97
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:54,240
can you find some Corners some place of awareness

98
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,760
of attention of mindfulness

99
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,660
that's quiet maybe quiet of

100
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:13,820
the discursive thinking mind peaceful

101
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,020
peaceful and not being for or against anything

102
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,519
open or spacious

103
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:34,519
making room for whatever is here

104
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:42,980
but not getting involved in it just knowing just aware

105
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,460
quiet peaceful spacious

106
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,360
is there a place is there some small

107
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:04,080
corner of your life where

108
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,360
you can sit breathing aware

109
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,539
in a way that allows makes room for trusts

110
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:24,379
life as it moves through us in whatever way it is

111
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,860
foreign

112
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,340
foreign

113
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,720
okay

114
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,960
and perhaps as we bring this meditation to a close

115
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:22,740
attuning yourself to your capacity

116
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:31,278
to be peaceful and may be that peacefulness is found

117
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,640
in the effort to be attuned

118
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:47,100
a peaceful Attunement a peaceful awareness

119
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:57,419
and maybe attuning yourself to it is partly helped by memory of

120
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:02,360
how some point in the past you've been peaceful

121
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,740
a deep State and maybe of calm or feeling of safety

122
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:14,279
ease peace

123
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:24,240
maybe a time when self-concerned self-preoccupation

124
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:32,340
self assertion self-doubt

125
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:39,299
was absent and is there some way that that

126
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:45,539
absence of some quality of stressful self self-concern

127
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:50,900
can you attune yourself to that as we sit here

128
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,519
quality of peacefulness

129
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,900
and can you imagine or can you feel

130
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:15,799
a capacity for care for love for compassion

131
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,019
that flows from that peace

132
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,659
that it's not something that we are choosing or generating or

133
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:33,720
doing but something that's part of

134
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:39,440
the flow of life that flows from being peaceful

135
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:51,240
and perhaps if you can imagine that maybe remember sometime when your life

136
00:28:51,240 --> 00:29:00,260
with maybe you're close to that imagine that these following words

137
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:12,120
are part of that flow deep Attunement to peace and to

138
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,899
ourselves being ourselves in some deep peaceful way

139
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:32,419
May the people that I see and know and

140
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:40,880
hear about may they too be happy

141
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:48,380
may they too be peaceful

142
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:54,620
may they too be safe

143
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,440
may they too be free

144
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:09,299
may they too being happy and safe and free and peaceful

145
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:18,440
may they discover the gifts really being themselves where

146
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:27,000
the hearts movement free of discursive thought free of self-attachment

147
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,460
free of greed and hatred have a chance to

148
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,460
Revitalize enliven

149
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,679
heal and

150
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:55,500
give a profound meaning and belonging to their

151
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:01,380
to their life may all beings

152
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,640
know that peace

153
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,840
where there's an absence of self-attachment

154
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:29,768
[Music]

155
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,299
thank you

156
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:32,659
so for this Fifth and last talk on

157
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:38,760
aspirations that are support or an aspect of compassion

158
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:46,740
a manifestation of compassion that I want to emphasize

159
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:52,200
the possibility that aspiration can arise out of a peacefulness

160
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,360
out of peace and that peace is a wonderful reference point

161
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,460
for the motivations that are connected to being compassionate

162
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:09,480
it's not a few people for whom who confuse compassion with distress

163
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:15,720
compassion with their own discomfort around being in the presence of

164
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:22,260
suffering and they confuse the motivation to be compassionate to act compassionately

165
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:29,159
with the motivations that flow from that discomfort and that distress

166
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:35,760
and some of that has to do a lot with our attachments to self at all kinds of

167
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,880
attachments we might have and so even even some of the

168
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:47,100
most important kind of ways and things we can do to be compassionate and caring for others

169
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:53,039
we carry with us a something which is not peaceful something which is

170
00:33:53,039 --> 00:34:00,860
stressful something which there's attachment and clinging as part of it of force and assertiveness a

171
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:07,740
tension and um and and it's possible to do have

172
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:17,700
the aspiration to desire the motivation to be compassionate to uh be peaceful useful to arise kind

173
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:23,419
of in an easy light way and where there's not a lot of

174
00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:28,618
self-attachment self-concern that's entangled with that

175
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:33,740
where it's coming from not from any sense of being distressed or being

176
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:41,760
challenged or being somehow uncomfortable with being uncomfortable

177
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,300
but rather it comes from our capacity to be attuned to be open to be appreciative

178
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,700
to be aware in a broad open way

179
00:34:53,700 --> 00:35:00,540
and those three aware attuned and appreciative are three of

180
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:05,880
the important aspects of compassion that we've talked about already in this series

181
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,160
and so all those lead to the possibility that of a certain degree of Peace

182
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:16,680
certain degree of ease and um of non-clinging

183
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:22,200
and to have compassion arise out of non-clinging has it looked very different

184
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:27,300
than maybe conventionally what people think compassion is supposed to look like

185
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:33,960
sometimes people feel like if there's some injustice in the world we're supposed to be angry we're supposed to

186
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,480
be upset and if we're not upset enough we don't show that we care

187
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,820
but that upsetness that anger uh it may

188
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,920
very well be a symptom of something that we're attached to something we're clinging to

189
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,960
some assertion of self that's not really necessary as part of it

190
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,060
and the alternative to being distressed and angry is not passivity is not

191
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:05,660
avoiding but it allows for maybe an equally or maybe even more powerful

192
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:13,079
motivation to rise within us to to to to change the Injustice to fight it in a

193
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:18,900
sense to but it comes out of it's part of the world of inner world of non-clinging and

194
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:27,200
in peace and the dharmic the Dharma kind of orientation around this is that

195
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:33,300
is that there's a we want to we want to trust the Dharma within us we want to

196
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:41,400
trust those natural processes of healing of freedom of of of love and

197
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:47,240
compassion that can flow and move through us

198
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:53,700
um without this kind of clinging and self-assertion as being part of it

199
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:59,880
and so I've in a in a category way I call this peace to trust peace and to

200
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,780
use peace as a reference point to understand the motivations we have to be compassionate

201
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:11,400
is the motivation to be compassionate is the actions of compassion coming from a

202
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:19,619
peaceful place a subtle Place coming from a place of calm or quiet someplace that's kind of not is below

203
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:24,780
the level of discursive thinking where we're spinning stories and fears and

204
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:33,740
Fantasies and projections and memories and all kinds of things that this swirling around that are driving

205
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:40,140
a certain kind of attached attitude towards it all that supports

206
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:46,260
fear supports anger supports the stress but if we can listen to that place below

207
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:54,660
the discursive thought the place that's more peaceful than most discursive thinking is reactive thinking then we

208
00:37:54,660 --> 00:38:00,839
have access to something quite different we can have this this uh the flow of

209
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:06,319
life uh you know life knows

210
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:13,260
what to bring forth life knows what movement towards homeostasis the harmony

211
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:19,859
to peace for everyone concerned and it's not a passivity it's very

212
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:26,760
important to understand this but it's to make room for this deeper motivation that sometimes

213
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:36,420
can lead to tremendous courage that doesn't look like courage perhaps because it's not forceful but it can be

214
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:42,359
give birth to a lifetime of dedication to live a life for the benefit of the

215
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:49,400
world to benefit of trying to find a way to uh

216
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,320
alleviate more suffering in this world but if we can do it from this place of

217
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:01,040
peace then it's sustainable and then it doesn't give birth to

218
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,480
at least maybe it's an ancient phenomena but it has in only in modern times does

219
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,900
it have a name and that is sometimes called compassion fatigue or compassion overwhelm

220
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:18,480
and and it's kind of unfortunate these two are connected fatigue and compassion

221
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:25,079
but it's when our our so-called compassionate actions in the world uh go

222
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:30,839
come along with um these complications of attachments of

223
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:37,859
clinging of self-assertion self-definition self-victimization that goes on when we

224
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:44,520
act and we don't know how to come from this peaceful place but we come more from you know some other place where

225
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,619
that we're much more vulnerable to be impacted in negative ways and be

226
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:55,020
exhausted but to um so to use as a reference point

227
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:01,619
as we study is we're mindful of our aspirations and realize that all the different aspects of aspiration that

228
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:09,660
that make it richer the world of aspiration you know Wonderful to have a reference point of peace is it

229
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:16,079
peaceful is it free of clinging this aspiration and one of the reasons why these are

230
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:22,920
important questions is that one of the directions orientations for where to be

231
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:29,760
compassionate is in fact to ourselves of course many of us will be attached

232
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,480
and clinging many of us will have our inner challenges many of us will be will have fatigue and distress

233
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:44,760
it's not a crime to be this way it's very important not to add layers of criticism of ourselves or

234
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,420
shame even on top of that but this peaceful place to be aware

235
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:56,040
uh and and using that as a reference point can help show us oh I'm not

236
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:02,460
peaceful and the compassion also can be directed here to myself to what's happening

237
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:08,880
within me can I hold this with a kind of peaceful presence that

238
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:17,040
maybe a friend would offer you sitting on a bench in a park just being present and listening to you talking

239
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:23,880
about your difficulties and it's so meaningful that someone just is there in a non-reactive way in an

240
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:30,119
attentive way peaceful way you know not asserting themselves not fixing you not

241
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:37,260
treating you as someone you they need to help but treating you with respect and and serving you in a sense with their

242
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:44,760
presence and their attention and their attentive care um to be able to do that to oneself

243
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:51,060
in a deep way so uh so these different aspects of

244
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:56,460
aspiration that I've talked about today this last one is maybe maybe it's the

245
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:02,220
most difficult because it you know this is what comes maybe with a deep

246
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:10,140
spiritual growth maybe the Deep growth in the Dharma is we become more and more attuned to a place a possibility of

247
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:16,619
Peace of calm of ease that it can't always be that way or be

248
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:21,900
fully that way but it becomes a reference point for

249
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:27,900
um for seeing more clearly what is here and that peace and that kind of peaceful

250
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:33,540
way of being aware can be seen to be a 360 degree awareness

251
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:40,920
that includes ourselves includes the whole world and uh and for aspiration to be that way

252
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:48,420
or the possibility of aspiration to be that way is one of the reasons why I feel that as this deep aspiration this

253
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:54,720
deep intentionality this deep motivation to live for the welfare and happiness of

254
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,920
the world is one of the most beautiful things that we can have even if it's partial even if it's you

255
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,099
know haltingly it's just that this capacity is something we have and that we can live from that

256
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:13,980
I think it's a beautiful beautiful thing so

257
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:19,440
um aspiration so um

258
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,560
so we're going through these different aspects of compassion and then the five that we that you know

259
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:32,460
before we've done now so far is awareness appreciation awareness Attunement appreciation and to

260
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:39,180
and this aspiration and the next time I'm here at the 7A at this YouTube teaching

261
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:46,380
um I'll do five days on action the fifth part of compassion and which is very important as well but

262
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:53,220
for have the action arise when these other four are have been kind of in the

263
00:43:53,220 --> 00:44:00,240
picture have been included and considered then the action becomes much more important or valuable for everyone

264
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,819
concerned including oneself so I'll do that so I'm I won't be here

265
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:13,079
now again for three weeks I'm going down to uh tasahara The Zed Monastery in in

266
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:21,060
the mountains here south of here uh in order to teach um seven three week Retreat a kind of a

267
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:27,540
Zen retreat but kind of a Zen vipassana hybrid of sorts with my friend uh then teacher Paul

268
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:33,480
Heller and um and uh

269
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:40,859
and then I'll be back uh up here at the IMC or you know part of teaching

270
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:46,380
on a Saturday July 29th and I'm teaching a day-long

271
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:52,260
retreat that's titled freedom and mindfulness of emotions through uh IRC

272
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:59,579
the Insight Retreat Center and I'll try to put the notice of it in the what's new at the imc's website

273
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:06,240
under Reflections from Gill but some of you might want to come to that online day-long Retreat I think it's from 9 to

274
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,880
4 30 in California time and we have some wonderful teachers

275
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:19,140
coming in the next couple of weeks and I think right now we don't have a teacher for the third We Come Away

276
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:24,359
um but uh we're still looking for someone and hopefully that's easy enough

277
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:29,780
and and we don't have to be creative what we do that third week

278
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:34,578
and um and um

279
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:43,079
so thank you and uh I'm certainly appreciating this chance to explore compassion this way with all

280
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:51,078
of you these weeks that I'm here and I look forward to continuing when I come back on I guess I'm back on the

281
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:57,540
there there I'm not sure if it's the first day of August or the last day of July that

282
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:02,240
Monday so thank you very much
