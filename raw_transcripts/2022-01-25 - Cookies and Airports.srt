1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,000
welcome welcome everybody it's

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,400
it's such a pleasure to practice with others even if i'm alone in this room just knowing that

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,039
you're on the other side of these screens so thank you

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,519
so gil max ertstein and i are teaching a course on ethics

5
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,280
i think it's i'm not exactly sure now maybe 10 months long 8 9 10 11 months

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,320
around there and it's a lot of fun you know sometimes

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,960
this whole topic of ethics just feels like oh really like i don't want to be told a whole bunch of

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,559
rules or the sense of morality just feels heavy and

9
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:57,199
something that's not so interesting but we're approaching it in a way that

10
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,640
i'm finding really delightful and i know some of the students are as well

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,920
and the way that we are approaching it is less as a set of rules

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,759
because that's you know marginally helpful what's really helpful is

13
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:22,960
some ways to navigate our lives some ways to

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,000
make decisions to help us with decision making and choosing which direction to

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,719
go what to do these types of things that's really helpful and useful

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,040
so in this ethics class we started with just some foundations this idea of

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,840
wholesomeness and this idea of care and compassion

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,560
and we're now into the precepts looking at each of the precepts spending

19
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,119
a little bit more time with each one and we recently finished the second

20
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,479
precept to not take that which is not given

21
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,160
it's a little bit stilted way of saying it it's kind of like saying not stealing

22
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,040
but uh the buddhists have a little bit higher or different um conception of it that it's

23
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,200
things have to be offered and then we get into all these questions about ownership and offering

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,840
and all kinds of things but that's not what i want to talk about tonight

25
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,720
instead it's just this idea of how we navigate our lives how we make decisions

26
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,560
in so many of the mundane things that we do i know sometimes when we think about the

27
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,200
dharma and the teachings of the buddha we might have these really lofty ideas which is fantastic

28
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,720
and certainly there are plenty of those that can be helpful and supportive

29
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,480
but we might also sometimes feel like some of these little corners of our lives

30
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:09,280
these mundane corners of our lives we don't really bring the dharma to

31
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,000
so the last few times that i've given a talk on monday nights i talked about some of these mundane things like new

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,280
year's resolutions and how we can bring the dharma to them

33
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,879
and i'd like to continue on that vein and share a story that we shared in this

34
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,920
in the ethics course and to talk about some of the ideas but

35
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:41,840
not the ones that we should talked about in the ethics course i'm going to bring in some other ideas

36
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,720
just highlighting how there are so many different

37
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,840
practices or teachings that we can bring to just ordinary

38
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,560
activities in a way that support us and nourish us

39
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,439
coach us guide us inspire us without feeling like it's this

40
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,879
heavy burdensome thing that we have to do on top

41
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,199
of our ordinary life instead it just it gets uh woven in

42
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,560
integrated with in such a way that it's a support

43
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,040
so there's two stories that we talked about one was as i said with the second

44
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,280
precept and another story we talked about in this ethics class at the beginning when we were talking

45
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,560
about some of the foundations of ethics and they have a common theme

46
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,680
and i'm sure you'll pick up the common theme but this first one that i'm going to

47
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,400
share is in some ways it's kind of silly it's a poem that rhymes that has a particular meter

48
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:03,360
and it's colorful and but part of the beauty of it is that it's kind of mundane

49
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,720
but there can be some real depths also to it

50
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:16,240
this story i tried to figure to discover like when it was first published and i couldn't find it i did find some

51
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,440
reference that somebody had said um it first came out in the 90s

52
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,880
but it was originally written in the 80s but i didn't actually see the

53
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,639
publications at that time so i don't really know and honestly i don't even remember where

54
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,960
i heard this first it might have been in a dharma talk something yeah right

55
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:46,320
that's how all of us drama teachers we just hear um when we're co-teaching or when we just hear other dharma teachers

56
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,600
and we just pass around all the same stories so hopefully you haven't heard this one

57
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,199
too many times okay so

58
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,800
maybe um i won't uh say the name of the poem

59
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,840
and the artist the poet until after the end

60
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,680
so that um just yeah i'll always the end

61
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,960
here we go a woman was waiting at the airport one night with several long hours before her

62
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,600
flight she hunted for a book in the airport shop bought a bag of cookies and found a

63
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:35,919
place to drop she was engrossed in her book but happened to see that the man beside

64
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,840
her as bold as could be grabbed a cookie or two from the bag

65
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,560
between which she tried to ignore to avoid a scene

66
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,680
she read munched cookies and watched the clock

67
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,639
as the gutsy cookie thief diminished her stalk she was getting more irritated as the

68
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,080
minutes ticked by thinking if i weren't so nice i'd

69
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,479
blacken his eye with each cookie she took

70
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,840
he took one too when only one was left she wondered what

71
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,680
he'd do with a smile on his face and a nervous laugh

72
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:32,400
he took the last cookie and broke it in half he offered her half and he ate the other

73
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:40,240
she snatched it from him and thought oh brother this guy has some nerve and he's also so

74
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,840
rude why he didn't even show any gratitude

75
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,360
she had never known when she had been so galled and sighed with relief when her

76
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,680
flight was called she gathered her belongings and headed for the gate

77
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,198
refusing to look at that thieving in great

78
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,479
she boarded the plane and sank in her seat then sought her book almost complete

79
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:16,879
as she reached in her baggage she gasped with surprise

80
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:24,319
there were her bag of cookies in front of her eyes

81
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,919
if mine are here she moaned with despair

82
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:36,240
then the others were his and he tried to share

83
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,360
too late to apologize she realized with grief

84
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,399
that she was the rude one the ingrate the

85
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,240
thief so this kind of uh

86
00:08:52,240 --> 00:09:01,760
amusing poem is called the cookie thief by valerie cox c-o-x is her last name

87
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,279
right so this scene unfolds at the airport

88
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,320
and this woman has this whole entire story created about the

89
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,399
person next to her she's getting angry she even has this uh

90
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,959
saying what is this um if i weren't so nice i'd black in his

91
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,920
eye right getting quite angry right this this

92
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:40,480
bewilderment and anger is coming up and then right when she gets on the

93
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:47,600
airplane and discovers that indeed she has her own bag of cookies just in that moment right

94
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,680
just that moment it doesn't take any moment longer everything gets reinterpreted

95
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,959
oh right i'm the thief i'm the in great

96
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:06,560
i'm the one that was not behaving so nicely

97
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,480
right it just took a flash so there's so many things that we can

98
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,760
learn from this story but one thing that i'd like to look out to right now maybe there's two things

99
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,399
one is as i just mentioned the view the view of this person that was sitting

100
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,079
beside her she had he was a thief he was in great he was rude had this whole

101
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:41,279
story right by something he was doing and that how it could change in a flash

102
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,399
so this view this idea this opinion they're really

103
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,519
insubstantial they're fleeting

104
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,160
they are not the something that is uh

105
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,839
going to stick around forever and all it took

106
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:10,079
was her to have one piece of information for her to look in her baggage

107
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:17,360
and to see her bag of cookies so just this recognition that we have

108
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,680
ideas we have views we have opinions and sometimes we

109
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,800
hold on to them so tightly were willing to threaten somebody to

110
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,640
blacken their eye picking these views

111
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,000
and all it takes is one additional piece of information

112
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,560
for us to realize oh we're completely mistaken

113
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:55,040
so why are we holding so tightly to our views a they can disappear poof they can be

114
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,160
gone just like that with just one little piece of

115
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,519
information and she had plenty of data we might say

116
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,760
to support her right that he kept on taking the cookies but he even

117
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,560
uh broke it in half and shared with her but that didn't change her opinion

118
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,959
she had already set this view of this poor person sitting behind her sitting beside her

119
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,639
she already had made up her her opinion about how he was

120
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,880
even though he did something that didn't uh suggest that he was a mean ungrateful

121
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,959
person or a thief i don't think a thief would share things

122
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,200
so it's just a reminder to all of us we have views

123
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,240
about ourselves about others we may have data to support it right we there's

124
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,760
reasons why we have views but we don't have to hold on to them so

125
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,720
tightly so much so that we're willing to villainize other people

126
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:14,079
and willing to make them the bad person right and she says if i weren't so

127
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:20,480
nice i'd blacken his eye right so she kind of builds herself up

128
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,360
i'm the good one he's the bad one and that's kind of this righteous indignation

129
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:34,399
that's building and building and building until just one piece of information

130
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,480
so in the story just a reminder for all of us that not to hold on so tightly to our

131
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,000
views and i'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment here

132
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,440
but also this um idea that just having one more piece of

133
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,600
information one more idea is enough to really

134
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,760
completely transform the way that she thought about that the way that she thought about that

135
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,440
whole scene that unfolded while she was waiting for her flight

136
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,760
this is part of what insight is for insight meditation is we start to see things we start and seeing and there's

137
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,839
this understanding and then our our interpretation or the way we move

138
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,680
the world or understand the world starts to shift and change based on that information

139
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,720
based on seeing things differently so these insights

140
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:46,399
are a way that it's a new way of seeing that also relieves suffering

141
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,639
that's kind of maybe the traditional way that we might think of a insight in this tradition

142
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,720
is it's also tied to the lessening of suffering because this is all going towards freedom greater and greater

143
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,920
freedom so this idea of we might have a new understanding but that it's also linked

144
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:13,440
to less suffering and we might say that the woman in the story that she had a little bit more

145
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:21,600
suffering at the moment when she discovered but unfortunately maybe she didn't take the

146
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:29,199
opportunity to really harvest all the different insights that could have been there

147
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:36,000
so maybe before i go on and start to talk a little bit more about insights i will say that during this ethics class

148
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,240
we have talked about a number of different things related specifically to the second precept the nature of

149
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,680
stealing what does it mean to steal and if people really know or you're stealing

150
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,839
or the nature of ownership what is it like to own things the importance of

151
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,959
generosity the importance of communication right a few words between this woman and this man might

152
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:06,399
have made a world of difference they could have discovered a love of the same kind of cookies and chatted and become

153
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,399
friends and who knows if they were both single kind of been their true loves

154
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,240
they were traveling to the same location maybe they were even neighbors and they didn't know it you know like a whole

155
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,720
story right that i'm creating here but my point is if they had spoken to one another right of course it would have

156
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,320
changed but they didn't

157
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,600
and this i she could have not only this woman could have maybe she did right we

158
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,720
don't know what happened after she realized that she was actually the one that was taking his cookies

159
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,199
but this idea of insight is central right to

160
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:58,320
this path of practice and that buddha points to many times in many

161
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,720
different ways it points to the importance of not clinging to views but

162
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,558
instead there's this alternative to creating views that we really hold on

163
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,760
to or these beliefs of course we're gonna create views

164
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,120
it's it's human nature and we need to in order to navigate our lives navigate the

165
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:28,720
world friend or foe harmful helpful right we have some of these initial

166
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,559
ideas but the buddhists so the buddha is not pointing to

167
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:41,120
not doing some of these human things but holding them lightly

168
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:49,280
not clinging to them and not using them as something for us to build up our own sense of self for us

169
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,480
to kind of bolster any sense of self that we might having but instead just to

170
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,520
say well it seems like there's a misunderstanding here

171
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,919
but in particular because one thing we might learn from this story or this woman might have learned at this

172
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:13,559
story is something about the nature of experiences

173
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,919
how for example i'm i'm highlighting that the moment that she had this

174
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,200
additional information then how everything just flipped and switched her understanding her

175
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:32,720
interpretation of everything happened so there was this one story this one view

176
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:39,679
that arose and then passed away this man is ungrateful he's a thief he's

177
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,280
rude i can't believe he's taking my cookies and then bam that she no longer thinks that of that

178
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:53,440
person so the buddha pointed to the value for us to notice the arising

179
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,880
and passing away of experiences the rising and passing away

180
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,000
of our holding to a view sometimes we don't recognize how we're holding to a

181
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,960
view until we let it go but the tremendous

182
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,480
power this has in our life to notice oh yeah impermanence

183
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,400
they're rising and passing and if we notice this intentionally bring our mind

184
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,440
to it or when we notice it because it's so obvious

185
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:34,400
that just to allow the mind and the heart to linger and the noticing of the impermanence

186
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,440
just so that we don't so readily forget it and try to make think concretize and

187
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,799
substantiate and permatize so many of our experiences in our views

188
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:52,000
because it leads to suffering we know this right clinging to anything

189
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,280
including our views and beliefs leads to suffering

190
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:04,640
so of course the buddha was pointing to that our experiences are inconstant they're always changing

191
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,880
they're fleeting they arise and they pass away but he also

192
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,000
pointed to some other qualities of our experiences

193
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,039
this triad of gratification danger and escape is

194
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:27,200
the way that pikaboti translates them so all of our experiences

195
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,440
do have some can be a sense of there's a gratification there like something

196
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,799
is something that's maybe

197
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:44,080
even if it's really fleetingly can be fulfilling in some kind of way

198
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,400
there's this the they can create the conditions for pleasure and joy but sometimes just

199
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,640
having sense experiences can be satisfying but i have to be careful here right it's

200
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,520
not any lasting happiness it's not any lasting satisfaction right because

201
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:10,559
they're impermanent and so there is this little bit of gratification and we might say in this

202
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,960
poem this story was she was enjoying the cookies we might say that she was enjoying her

203
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,840
righteous indignation she was enjoying if i weren't so nice i'd blacken his eye

204
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:30,720
right she's like look what a nice person she is she's not yelling at him or

205
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,159
or blackening his eye or something like this right so

206
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,799
there can be this gratification is the word that sometimes get used for this

207
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,880
but all of these experiences also have kind of the danger maybe danger is too

208
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:56,159
strong of a word but this idea that our experiences don't last forever so

209
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:02,080
even if they are bringing pleasure and joy they're going to end

210
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,360
and that's gonna bring the opposite of pleasure and joy

211
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,320
sorrow and grief of some magnitude maybe not to the same magnitude but

212
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:21,120
there's often sometimes there's this little bit of fear like when is this going to end or a little bit of distress how long is this

213
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,240
going to last that's often you know bubbling

214
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,120
underneath so many of our experiences

215
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:39,360
this poem we do see her becoming more and more agitated and as i said earlier she had missed an opportunity to maybe

216
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:46,158
have a connection with somebody who was traveling the same place she was traveling

217
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,440
so the buddha talked about notice they arise and pass away there's gratification there's danger and there's

218
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,720
escape so escape is this

219
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,840
removal of the things wanting to be different this ending of kind of leaning

220
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,760
forward this greediness for them and we see this we have this experience

221
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,280
temporarily when we meditate there can be can be when we sit

222
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,960
a sense of contentment quiet even if it's just for a few moments and

223
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,039
even if that's not our dominant experience but just to know that that can be part

224
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:32,159
of our experience can be enormously helpful

225
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:38,640
and then of course the ultimate escape from the dissatisfaction of

226
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:46,799
or the danger of experiences is awakening where a person is no longer fooled into

227
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,320
wanting to cling or substantiate or concretize

228
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,919
reify our experiences or our views

229
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,320
and it's helpful to create the condition so that we can see the rising and passing

230
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:11,200
of our experiences and the gratification danger and escape of them and this is a big part of why we

231
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,919
meditate just to allow some settling down if we're always running around rushing

232
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:24,960
around we'll never really notice the we will notice but it doesn't really

233
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:31,679
register we don't really take it in and let the ramifications affect us

234
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,240
if that things are inconstant arise and pass away and are changing

235
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,840
so the cookie thief

236
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,600
title right it starts out he is the cookie thief and at the end

237
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,960
she is the cookie thief the stories of cookies and at the

238
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:03,679
airport there's much more i could say on this poem and maybe you have some of your own

239
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:10,880
ideas on this but now i'd like to shift gears a little bit and read a second story

240
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:18,480
that we shared in this ethics class and also has cookies and an airport

241
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,520
and this one is a little bit different this and at the end i'll share the title

242
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,039
of the poem and the poet and this poem is maybe written more in prose

243
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:37,039
style wandering around the albuquerque airport

244
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:43,600
terminal after learning my flight had been delayed four hours i heard an announcement

245
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:50,320
if anyone in the vicinity of gate a4 understands any arabic

246
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,520
please come to the gate immediately well

247
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:02,080
one pauses these days gay day four was my own gait i went

248
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,400
there an older woman in full traditional palestinian embroidered dress

249
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,159
just like my grandma wore was crumpled on the floor wailing

250
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:20,480
help said the flight agent talk to her what is her problem we told

251
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,679
her the flight was going to be late and she did this i stooped to put my arm around the woman

252
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,799
and spoke haltingly shudawa

253
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:39,840
shubidak abbipdi stanishway minfadlik

254
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:51,120
asking for forgiveness on how terrible i'm probably i'm probably butchering this so my apologies

255
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,880
so she speaks this little bit of arabic the minute she heard any words she knew

256
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,159
however poorly used she stopped crying she thought the flight had been

257
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,320
cancelled entirely she needed to be in el paso for major medical treatment the next day

258
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:16,320
i said no we're fine you'll get there just later who is picking you up let's call him

259
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,240
we called her son i spoke with him in english i told him i would stay with his mother till we got

260
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,240
on the plane and right next to her she talked to him then we called her other sons just for

261
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,159
the fun of it then we called my dad and he and she spoke for a while in arabic and found

262
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:40,240
out of course they had 10 shared friends then i thought just for the heck of it

263
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,360
why not call some palestinian poets i know and let them chat with her

264
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:52,799
this all took up two hours she was laughing a lot by then telling of her life patting my knee

265
00:27:52,799 --> 00:28:00,240
answering questions she had pulled a sack of homemade mamul cookies little powdered sugar crumbly

266
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,000
mounds stuffed with dates and nuts from our bag and was offering them to

267
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,399
all the women at the gate to my amazement not a single woman

268
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:18,880
declined one it was like a sacrament the traveler from argentina

269
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,000
the mom from california the lovely woman from laredo

270
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:33,360
we were all covered with the same powdered sugar and smiling there is no better cookie

271
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,840
and then the airline broke out free apple juice from the huge from huge coolers and two little girls from our

272
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,279
flight ran around serving it and they were covered with powdered sugar too

273
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,799
and i noticed my new best friend by now we were holding hands had a potted plant

274
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:56,799
poking out of her bag some medicinal thing with green furry leaves

275
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,880
such an old country tradition always carry a plant

276
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:09,360
always stay rooted to somewhere and i looked around that gate of late

277
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:17,360
and weary ones and i thought this is the world i want to live in

278
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,120
the shared world not a single person in that gate once

279
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:30,640
the crying of confusion stopped seemed apprehensive about any other person

280
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,679
they took the cookies i wanted to hug all those other women

281
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,960
too this can still happen

282
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,039
anywhere not everything is lost

283
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,399
so this poem or story is called gate a4

284
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:00,000
by naomi shihab nai naomi shihab nai is a buddhist

285
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,039
practitioner and i believe she's even like practice with the san francisco zen center

286
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:13,360
and she's i think her as a palestinian father an american mother and grew up in both

287
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,360

288
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:28,240
she and says this is the world i want to live in the shared world

289
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,919
not a single person in that gate once the crying of confusion stopped

290
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:40,080
seemed apprehensive about any other person they took the cookies

291
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,679
i wanted to hug all those other women too this can still

292
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:53,120
happen anywhere not everything is lost

293
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:03,440
cookies and airports may all beings be free from suffering

294
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:10,559
and may they recognize that not everything is lost this can still happen

295
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,799
thank you
