00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:07,559
hello and welcome on this

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:17,758
week of the five faculties as the theme and now on Friday fifth faculty is

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:26,039
wisdom and an alternative translation of PA

4
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,320
often translated as wisdom is dis

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,520
discernment our faculty our capacity to be Discerning in the moment to have

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,600
insight about what is useful and not useful to do what is skillful what is

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,399
wholesome to do and uh and this very basic

8
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:59,359
distinction that guides what we what we engage in what we do with our lived life

9
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:06,240
as we live it is invaluable that we always have a guide a guide a support a

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,080
reference point for how to go forward and that's maybe fundamental to

11
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,360
e every purpose we have the activities in which we engage

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,880
in all fall back to a common denominator when we're doing Buddhist

13
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,360
practice we see it with wisdom we see it with discernment

14
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,000
and the simple distur is we know to do those

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
things that bring happiness bring well-being

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,479
build a bring a feeling of ease or calm or peace or and we avoid those things it does the

17
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:58,600
opposite and so when we sit and meditate we start getting a clear sense

18
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,520
that certain things we do do are not really useful not really beneficial for

19
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,520
ourselves to spend a lot of time thinking planning reviewing

20
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,640
fantasizing is seeing Oh this is not so useful there's a discernment a clear knowing a clear

21
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,280
Insight it's obvious oh there's better things to do than be caught up in

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:33,640
thoughts we can be mindful we can be present for our lived experience really be here with this and part of the reason

23
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:40,599
to be here this is where the evidence exists for becoming Discerning becoming

24
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:46,599
wise we see in our own experience that when

25
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:53,760
we have the hindrances operating it doesn't serve us when there is

26
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:02,239
greed strong desire for something when there's ill will when we're stuck in fear or CAU up

27
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:09,879
in fear or toror resistance when there's restlessness and

28
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:18,000
regrets that we remorse that we're just spinning out on and when we're don't know what to do

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,560
we're uncertain we have doubts we're

30
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:30,640
wavering these are not so healthy for us but to have

31
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,879
confidence in a path of practice where we show up for our lives in a clear

32
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:42,480
way that we engage with a certain kind of heroic effort like yes being present

33
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,439
here this is invaluable

34
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:55,319
to accompany ourselves with mindfulness be present for our experience

35
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:03,920
yes to uh immerse ourselves in the experience to really com be composed and steady

36
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:12,159
here in our experience yes stay here be here these are the valuable things to

37
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:19,680
do and we can feel how the UN wholesome stuff creates stress

38
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:27,040
strain in fact the core discernment is between stress and the

39
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,160
absence of stress between ouch and

40
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:42,360
a so when we sit today is to sit with mindful discern discernment Discerning

41
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,360
mindfulness where we can discern

42
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,919
oh this way of being is stressful there must be another

43
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:59,840
way at least we can become mindful of it in a simple straightforward forward

44
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,560
maybe calm way peaceful mindfulness that's how we can

45
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,240
engage so assuming a meditation

46
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:19,440
posture and gently closing the

47
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:28,479

in gently tell your mind this is not the

52
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,800
time there's something more important to do

53
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:11,720
now here to be present and lived experience through the

54
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,800
body and as you exhale to relax your

55
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:35,680
body with the mind's discernment we can discern and see that

56
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,400
holding tension is not so

57
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,199
beneficial that relaxing the tension softening around the

58
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,680
tension that is wholesome that's a good thing to

59
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
do

60
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:17,160
and then relaxing the thinking mind having mental tension is also

61
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,520
not so

62
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:31,319
beneficial what is beneficial is to soften and relax that tension

63
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,360
letting the thinking mind become calmer and

64
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,080
slower Maybe by reassuring your thinking

65
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:54,759
mind that here and now sitting in meditation is

66
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,560

69
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,120
these minutes maybe you'll be in a better

70
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,240
place to consider them after your

73
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:12,240
discovered is that mindfulness is always

74

[Music]

150
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,000
happy thank

151
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
you

152
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:37,639
so hello everyone welcome to this fifth talk on

153
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:42,760
the five faculties these

154
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,960
five kind of inner powers that we have

155
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,600
and whereas in the ancient world they call them uh aspects of Indra the great God

156
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:00,360
So Divine qualities inside in a colloquial English we might say that

157
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:05,639
these days that there are superpowers that we

158
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:11,399
have they're so important to these five

159
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:19,399
indas um these five faculties capacities

160
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:27,559
so uh they all have to do with action not about just understanding and seeing

161
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:33,399
except that understanding and seeing is a kind of action is an

162
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:39,600
engagement and this idea of choiceful engaging consciously

163
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:46,200
engaging with our life is not something we often hear in

164
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,480
the meditation circles where a lot of is about relaxing settling back being

165
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:57,360
receptive not asserting oneself and those are fantastic ways is

166
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:03,919
to engage they're a kind of Engagement there's something we do with choice we're activating something to be

167
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,200
receptive we're activating um letting go and this here

168
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:17,039
we in the five faculties we're emphasizing the activation of something which is nourishing helpful

169
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:24,440
sustaining freeing for us and so to to

170
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:31,440
activate uh confidence in what we're doing what not not to do things out of

171
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:38,399
habit not to do things out of just because we should not to do things because we're forced to but like when

172
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,080
you come to meditation to choose to engage in a

173
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:50,919
conscious kind of deliberate way that yes I'm engaging in this I'm going to be

174
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:56,240
here for this but not in a way that's stressful not in a way that stirs things

175
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,880
up but does the opposite it helps us to ody andh habit what we're doing that

176
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,878
something settles and relaxes um like someone who is engaged

177
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:15,919
in doing um you know something like yoga or Tai Chi

178
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,960
Chiang it takes effort we have to put ourselves into it but in the movements

179
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,960
of these practices something begins to quiet and settle and let go and we're

180
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,320
more and more embodied in here but there is a choice to engage to

181
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,560
activate and to enter into the activation that something

182
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,878
harmonizes so the confidence in practice is that that what gets us going and

183
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:51,118
chooses yes big yes let's do it and sometimes it takes heroic

184
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,878
effort it takes uh courage to show up here and now sometimes it's courage

185
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:05,680
courage because it goes against the the prevailing winds of society that there's more emails to uh answer there's more um

186
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,880
Netflix movies to watch there's more this and that and things to do and get

187
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,599
busy and things are you know Dire Straits we're alarm alarmed by how

188
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:25,000
things are so we have to kind of get anxious and busy to be courageous that we don't have to do that

189
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:32,400
in fact we show up better better for the world and care for the world better if

190
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,520
we show up uh calmly relaxedly openly

191
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:44,960
prepared smart to be able to tune into what's happening so to have the courage to do

192
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,920
this and then the fifth faculty is mindfulness which and this week I'm been

193
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:56,960
presenting as accompanyment we choose to accompany we engage in this practice of accomp

194
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:04,680
comping ourselves the world around us as if we're a good friend a non-judgmental friend who's

195
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:13,040
there to listen and see and hold everything there with care and then uh to steady ourselves in

196
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:20,000
that to immerse ourselves in this present moment experience like a good maybe in again with these movement

197
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,160
practices of yoga or Tai Chi or Chiang uh or other ones that uh uh we

198
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:32,839
immerse ourselves in the activity we're doing and almost like we forget ourselves and forget time playing a

199
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:38,960
musical instrument doing a a craft there are things we do which um you know take

200
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:45,480
effort and energy but when we finish doing them we feel much more relaxed the steadiness because we

201
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,760
immersing ourselves in what we're doing so and then the fif fifth faculty for

202
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:57,839
today is um usually translated as wisdom and uh today I'm offering it as discern

203
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:03,200
because wisdom is always present moment Focus to to see in such a way that we're

204
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:09,000
wise so which is another meaning for discernment and

205
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,839
um the um and the idea is to discern useful ways to be present for

206
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:24,480
this world useful way to activate our accompaniment our mindfulness our life

207
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:31,000
this wonderful gift we're given of being gift we've been given of Consciousness being consciously

208
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:39,280
aware be Discerning about how we can use that how we can be aware so that it it

209
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:46,400
it reduces stress it doesn't add to stress not only does it reduce stress it

210
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,960
also brings forth a a higher quality beneficial way of being in the world it

211
00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:00,640
allows for some deeper sensitivity deeper flow of of Good Will and wisdom

212
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:06,760
and freedom and um not so different again you know doing a movement like

213
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:13,359
yoga and taii and Chiang that uh we might even be stressed out and hardly able to think very well for ourselves

214
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:18,839
when we start but at the end of the class uh we're much more present and

215
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:27,640
ready to have conversations with people and take care of things and be in the world in a nice open clear way

216
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:34,119
so to be Discerning about what we're doing as we engage in our accompaniment

217
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:42,200
of Life how do we accompany it so there's less stress tensing up rushing

218
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:48,200
uh being angry having ill will having desires caught up in fantasies that

219
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,520
obscure how well we can see what's there those are not skillful we can see that

220
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,240
we can feel it and we learn over time that that's not the way to live a

221
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:07,680
life a free life a productive a useful life is one that we engage and

222
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:15,680
activate being present with this beautiful capacity of my of conscious

223
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:23,240
awareness and um and so to inhabit that to to have confidence in that have

224
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:29,040
courage to show up this way to have the accompaniment that allows conscious

225
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,400
awareness to really flower and to sustain it to be studied

226
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,560
in it composed in it that's what discernment supports us to

227
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:47,400
do and uh in the teachings of the Buddha uh it tends to be

228
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:55,720
binary uh that um that this kind of distinctions that um uh uh between what

229
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:02,160
is helpful and what is not helpful and um and that just that uh

230
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:10,680
that's my words for the Translating the Buddha kind of my paraphrasing of it but just that is what I'm doing now helpful

231
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:17,760
is or is it not helpful and um and if it's at all

232
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,960
unhelpful don't do it have enough discernment to recognize oh I don't

233
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,400
think this is helpful and certainly if you're going to make this situation worse don't do

234
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:36,920
it have enough discernment to know what not to do just that is

235
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:43,880
life-changing but then if in addition you know have the discernment the clarity In This

236
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,680
Moment how to activate how to bring forth

237
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,560
conscious awareness in a way that is beneficial is

238
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:02,200
onward leading uh helps you become wiser and clear helps you to be present in a nice way

239
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:10,240
for this world of ours and for others do it by all means and do it a lot let it

240
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,800
fill your life let yourself be immersed in a life of conscious

241
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:23,800
awareness with the confidence the Courage the showing

242
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:30,359
up the giving yourself to being

243
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:36,800
Discerning having the discernment to know that confidence is good

244
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:43,000
confidence what is good to have confidence in this

245
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:51,040
practice to have the courage to know what to do conscious awareness showing

246
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,920
up to have discernment to know the value of accompaniment

247
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:04,000
that you how you accompany your life is where conscious awareness can

248
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
flower to have the discernment to know that jumping around and being scattered

249
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,760
and preoccupied is not so useful that being

250
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:23,960
present steady continuous being here that is useful so these are superpowers these

251
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,040
are amazing capacities we do have each one of you has

252
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,280
this and in Buddhism these are becoming

253
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:40,200
activated these are becoming used and uh flowering for us in ways

254
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,440
that uh that are so beneficial and when there when these

255
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,599
becomes uh um strong in fact the Buddha

256
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:55,880
called them the five powers so to call them superpowers is

257
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:03,240
Maybe a little bit cute but but uh in fact he called it Bala and Pali and so

258
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,480
strengths and so to have those these strengths then they not only is what we

259
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,160
activate faculties we wake up and use but they become sustaining qualities

260
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,200
that are there kind of carrying us along supporting us in everything we

261
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:28,079
do so thank you very much and um
