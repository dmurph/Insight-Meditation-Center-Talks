and as we bring this sitting period so close together

171
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,680
appreciating that we've done our best we showed up

172
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:20,880

thank you for showing up

174
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,839
letting go of any judgment or what happened or did not happen

175
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:39,300
so many causes and conditions they can give rise to agitation

176
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:46,099
sleepiness all we can do is our best

177
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:54,920
the results it's not for us to attach to

178
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:04,220
and if we can be kind to ourselves in just this moment

179
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:10,680
appreciating our own goodness this is one moment

180
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:18,500
of goodness it's infinitely better than none

181
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:23,700
and let us dedicate share the goodness of our practice I speak there is

182
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:29,460

and before this practice that you notice a shift

199
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:39,839
a difference from when you started to sit I definitely do I feel calmer more

200

202
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:58,680

207
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:32,640
prayer when I was a little girl when I was going to bed my mother would have me

208
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,160
say and I don't know where it comes from but as I wrap myself in a blanket of

209
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,260
love and fall asleep filled with peace

210
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:49,460

sick with with care compassion for yourself or this body

233
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,619
[Music] I do appreciate the um earlier when I

234
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:25,800
asked you about the smiles so many of you lit up just so sweet to see all this miles

235
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,619
coming and lighting up very sweet so tell you what let's um

236
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:37,560
let's turn ever so gently as if we're wrapping ourselves in blankets of care

237
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:42,720
wrapping each other in blankets of care very calm gentle doesn't have to be

238
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,960
energetic but the question the query for tonight is can we engage with two other

239
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:55,020
human beings or practitioners without the usual ways that we show up like

240
00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:00,060
wanting to do like pulling forward can we just kind of be wrapped in our care

241
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:05,880
and having them be wrapped in care when it's just gentle being together for

242
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:12,240
maybe five six minutes in the room and notice can you can you share your

243
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:18,300
kindness for yourself and for others can you can you do that and and be aware of

244
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:25,140
the way that your um you're you're relating the way that you're relating

245
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:31,980
um again with kindness for yourself kindness for others say a word and say you can share

246
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:39,359
something about your practice going alphabetically or you can say past just hold space next person can share

247
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:44,480
something and then the next person or say pass so

248
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:51,560
so um yeah I'm going to create the rooms

249
00:43:53,240 --> 00:44:00,960
and invitation is see what it's like in this other way to to uh practice with

250
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,079
folks to stay very unique way of holding yourself with care others

251
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:12,839
with care okay I'm going to open the rooms be kind to yourself be kind to

252
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:20,520

253
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:27,599
very sweet actually to be smiling at other people silently so there you go

258
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:57,240
um had a test for attention challenges today it was like a four hour test so IQ

259
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:04,680
and I had previously had to do it as a kid and I did so poorly as a kid because of my internal self-talk was so negative

260
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:11,220
I was so distracted by my thoughts and why aren't you going faster and this and that and this time I just made his

261
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:16,500
curiosity and play and like every time my brain was challenged I would just

262
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:25,079
like kind of laugh at it and like take my time with it and just think of it in this totally metal way and and it made

263
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:32,880
me feel like I could do harder things and like my mind worked in ways I didn't expect and I pause and I closed my eyes

264
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:40,680
to listen like we do in Retreats and everything helped like I feel like so much of these practices has like Made Me
