1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,560
so

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,800
so as a way of continuing the

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,240
discussion of the buddha's teachings

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,240
on anapanasati

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,519
mindfulness of breathing

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,558
the buddha is presenting these 16 steps

7
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:34,640
for mindfulness of breathing

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,640
and then clearly showing their

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,320
connection

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,399
to two other important teachings

11
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,760
meditation teachings he has and one is

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,920
the teachings on the four

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,360
what's usually called the four

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,920
foundations of mindfulness

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,360
and what's usually called the seven

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,399
factors of awakening

17
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,760
and um it's really wonderful the way

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,480
that

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,600
rather than many people will feel that

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,000
you know that practice is practicing

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,600
those who know about the practicing the

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,080
four foundations of mindfulness

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,520
we'll see them as a very different

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,520
practice than

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,799
practicing mindfulness of breathing

26
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,799
and certainly the way they're taught is

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,320
often the case

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,360
but they also come together

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,680
especially in mindfulness of breathing

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,880
really becomes

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,520
some point or enters into the same

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,840
domain the same area of life as the four

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,118
foundations of mindfulness

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,079
and um and the way the buddha does this

35
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:42,640
is that

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,920
there's four tetrads in the 16 steps of

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,200
aleppanasati and each tetrad he says

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
corresponds to one of the foundations of

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,880
mindfulness

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,799
so as it usually said the foundation of

41
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,880
mindfulness that's

42
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,680
based on the body corresponds to the

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,600
first four steps of

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,600
breathing being aware of the long breath

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,759
bring where the short breath being aware

46
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,920
of the whole body as you breathe

47
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,120
and then being aware of the body calming

48
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,080
and relaxing

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,400
as you breathe so it's all about the

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,440
body

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,879
and when that becomes really well

52
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,440
established all four of these steps and

53
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,040
really awareness has become strong

54
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,560
then the awareness is based on

55
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,680
the body in the first

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,800
and the first foundation of mindfulness

57
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,400
it's really about establishing awareness

58
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,760
on the basis of the body and classically

59
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,920
there's a series of exercises to giving

60
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,440
or different ways of practicing

61
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,519
mindfulness practice

62
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,239
all for the purpose of establishing a

63
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:52,959
strong

64
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,040
mindfulness awareness in the body

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,720
in the second tetrad steps

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,159
five to eight

67
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,560
they are that corresponds to the second

68
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,800
foundation of mindfulness the foundation

69
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,280
of mindfulness on feelings

70
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,800
and so the second tetrad of anapanasati

71
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,000
is experiencing as we breathe feeling

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,280
joy

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,840
as we breathe feeling happiness as we

74
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,360
breathe

75
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,640
experiencing the mental activity

76
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,840
and then relaxing the mental activity

77
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,159
and this expert experiencing

78
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,200
could also be translated as feeling it

79
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,280
has the same word that we translate as

80
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,080
feeling

81
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,239
is embodied in the word experiencing the

82
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,840
way the pali

83
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,959
grammar is or l the words are used

84
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,120
and so ex feeling

85
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,159
joy feeling happiness feeling uh

86
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,439
the whole the mental activity and then

87
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,519
relaxing the mental activity

88
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,360
so this corresponds to this the

89
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,560
foundation of mindfulness on feeling

90
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
the third that threat has to do all

91
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,080
about the mind

92
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,000
and the third foundation is all about

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,599
the mind

94
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,480
so in the breathing exercises it's

95
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,439
experiencing

96
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,359
the mind not just the activity the whole

97
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,560
mind

98
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,600
gladdening the mind settling

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,759
stabilizing the mind concentrating the

100
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,639
mind

101
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,000
and then liberating the mind in the four

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,639
foundations of mindfulness

103
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,759
the it's

104
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,560
in part understanding really high

105
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,240
quality states of mind

106
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,800
maybe first the mind itself in some

107
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,080
certain ways particular

108
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,720
ways and then these high qualities of

109
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,440
mind

110
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,080
that correspond with gladdening roughly

111
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,840
of course by gladdening

112
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,840
concentrating and liberating the mind

113
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,120
and then the last tetrad uh is

114
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,280
observing all about observing observing

115
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,680
impermanence observing

116
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,360
fading away cessation and relinquishment

117
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,479
and these are the insights deep insights

118
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,160
and the fourth foundation of mindfulness

119
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,560
is also about about insights

120
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,440
it's really uh insight also into seeing

121
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,120
the arising and passing

122
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,039
how hindrances arise and they go and

123
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,160
seeing the suffering our suffering comes

124
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,520
and goes

125
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,840
and now that's the first of the

126
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,479
observations of the fourth tetrad

127
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,520
observing in constancy or change

128
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,000
and and the others follow in the wake of

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,800
that

130
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,199
so the buddha corresponds these two

131
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,440
these the four foundations are equal to

132
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,520
the four tetrads

133
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,160
but not just automatically it's when

134
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,560
awareness is well established

135
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,680
in each of these areas when it's when

136
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,080
when

137
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,160
when we're really grounded and centered

138
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,240
and present in a full way without being

139
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,840
distracted or

140
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,199
thinking a lot about the past and the

141
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,360
future this precious

142
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,199
precious thing that we have being aware

143
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,840
being able to really experience the

144
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,120
present moment

145
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,960
sense the present moment feel the

146
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,160
present moment

147
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,800
know the present moment in all its all

148
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,240
the dimensions of knowing

149
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,199
not just know it fleetingly but to feel

150
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:23,520
that

151
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,400
now we're centered we're at rooted we're

152
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,360
grounded

153
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,400
here and this feeling of being really

154
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,840
here definitely be grounded resting here

155
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,440
it's kind of like the difference between

156
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,319
maybe

157
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,560
being in a row but being tossed around

158
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,840
the sea

159
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,160
and then coming up on dry land now you

160
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,800
feel like it's stable and strong

161
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,440
here we are and there's a qualitatively

162
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,080
shift a quantum shift that can happen

163
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,080
inside when boom we're here

164
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,479
we don't have to work at being here and

165
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,120
come back

166
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,199
and come back and remember to be here

167
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,560
and present

168
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,840
we're not liable to wander off and the

169
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,560
awareness then becomes strong

170
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,880
and uh and that awareness is established

171
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,759
and uh so the translation i like for the

172
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,319
four foundations of mindfulness is

173
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,120
uh is the four ways the four basis

174
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,440
for establishing uh awareness

175
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,160
and um and then in the when the buddha

176
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,319
correlates these four these

177
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,360
these foundations and the four tetrads

178
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,680
and the fourth one he says then

179
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,440
mindfulness of the

180
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,039
ma of the dharmas is well established

181
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,560
so there's a strong level of equanimity

182
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,160
and this is one of the kind of

183
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,840
directions the practice goes when

184
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
there's a stability

185
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,879
boom we're here that then we're here in

186
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,879
such a strong way

187
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,639
that we're not easily tossed around by

188
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,160
the changing circumstances of our life

189
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,479
we're not easily losing our equanimity

190
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,240
our balance our

191
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,360
peacefulness when

192
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,680
difficult thought arises it just rise

193
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,280
and they go

194
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,639
when there's difficult painful

195
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,720
sensations in the body arise and

196
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,080
we just can feel them and know them and

197
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,400
and but mind doesn't get agitated or

198
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,840
disturbed

199
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,919
and this is called equanimity a lack of

200
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,440
agitation and lack of

201
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,800
being disturbed and

202
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,640
so both these practices the four

203
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,320
foundations of mindfulness whatever way

204
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,560
you've been taught to do them

205
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,800
and there's many ways that be possible

206
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,039
mindfulness is taught

207
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,279
or the mindfulness of breathing one of

208
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,440
the ways of doing this

209
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,920
whatever those practices are they're all

210
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,800
for the purpose

211
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,120
ultimately in buddhist practice to

212
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,279
come to a kind of dwelling resting

213
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,600
abiding aware in the present moment

214
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,959
without any tendency to leave that

215
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,880
and wander off from that and

216
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,240
some people then will use the

217
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,440
kind of the expression lucid awareness

218
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,720
when awareness is not ruffled when

219
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,200
our sense of mindfulness not ruffled by

220
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
what we know

221
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,200
that knowing becomes

222
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,959
free and independent

223
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,720
of what is known we can't separate what

224
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,640
we know from knowing

225
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,240
completely but but

226
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,560
the knowing is not ruffled it's not

227
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,839
agitated

228
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,200
it's not entangled it's not

229
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,399
clinging to what is known and this idea

230
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:50,720
of

231
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,160
knowing something and that kind of

232
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,320
freedom that equanimity

233
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,080
is then um the um

234
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,040
the the really the place where all the

235
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,800
different practices of mindfulness all

236
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,240
the different ways might be past our

237
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,279
practice

238
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,680
come together and and set the stage

239
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,680
for uh for awakening

240
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,519
so then tomorrow i'll talk about how

241
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,600
this goes to

242
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,279
is connected to the seven factors of

243
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,800
awakening

244
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,760
and i love this because um if there's

245
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,560
kind of a creating of a harmony or unity

246
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,320
in in the buddhist teachings we start

247
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,480
seeing how they all come together

248
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,519
as a whole and

249
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,440
in the way that this discourse on

250
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,360
anapanasati begins

251
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,560
where it begins with the

252
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,640
senior disciples of the buddha coming

253
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,680
together

254
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,920
with all their disciples and living

255
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,200
together for

256
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,839
a period of months in unity and in

257
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,120
harmony

258
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,640
receiving the buddhist teaching so

259
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,800
to have that sense of unity in harmony

260
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,720
with all the different sides of who we

261
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,680
are

262
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,640
that we could all come together and live

263
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,160
under the full moon of our

264
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,279
lucid awareness

265
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,880
so um thank you and

266
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,120
and we'll continue along this path of

267
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,720
the anapanasati

268
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,640
and tomorrow's the seven factors of

269
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,880
awakening and then we'll see

270
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,040
by thursday how the seven factors of

271
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,160
awakening

272
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,079
are practiced the practice changes

273
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,560
when a person has not just learned how

274
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,720
to be stably aware here

275
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,399
but has experienced a degree of real

276
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,880
liberation freedom from clinging

277
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,200
and how the practice of changes at that

278
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,279
point

279
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,560
so so we continue and we're almost at

280
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,519
the end of this

281
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:56,800
anapanasati series thank you
