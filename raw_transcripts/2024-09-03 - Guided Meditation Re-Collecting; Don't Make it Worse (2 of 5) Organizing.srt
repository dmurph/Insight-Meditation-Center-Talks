00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:09,519
welcome to the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City I'm sitting here in our

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,280
meditation Hall and happy to do so and to be with

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,680
you all of you this and um some of you are familiar

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,560
with a very common metaphor that's I I know of it mostly used in the secular

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:36,239
mindfulness movement and the sometimes in mindfulness of schools they'll use it where uh they'll take

6
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:44,800
a container of water and sand water and glitter like a snow snowball

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:54,039
bowl and um Shake everything up and then watch as uh all the sediment

8
00:00:54,039 --> 00:01:00,160
all the dust and sparkles or whatever it might be settle into into the and you

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,320
see clearly what's there the water becomes clear and

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,720
um so another way of maybe saying the same thing which is not so much a

11
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:18,920
settling which is wonderful feeling calming settling down is that uh in this practice we're

12
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:25,119
doing we also want to give time for the self

13
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:32,000
organizing um movement of our body and Minds that as awareness wakes up as we

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,560
become more aware of um of what's Happening Here and Now the idea is we're

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:46,320
integrating we're including we're um uh everything that we are and if we take

16
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,159
time to feel and sense into our bodies wake up our bodies feel our bodies wake

17
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,320
up emotionally feel what's happening emotionally recognize what's happening

18
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,759
is in our mind there's something about the simple recognition of it and waiting the simple

19
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:13,000
recognition and allowing it to be there in the field of attention allowing it to be there while

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,239
sensing it especially in a physical way the sensing feeling the embodiedness of

21
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,560
it even the embod embodiedness of uh a

22
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,519
mind which is caught up in thoughts and ideas what is the physicality what's the feeling what's the happens in what's the

23
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,560
sensations of the in the head and the brain that goes along with that and what

24
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:44,879
that does is it begins to make space for the sediment to settle but more than

25
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:52,760
that more importantly it allows things to uh recollect there's a recollection that

26
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,200
happens a reorganizing a coming together we uh

27
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:06,120
start getting put back together um or uh things get pulled together we get

28
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,840
we pull our not that we pull ourselves together but the system our psychophysical system is pulling itself

29
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,319
together and it's a remarkable process of waking up that we become whole

30
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:27,680
remarkable process by which we get recollected reunified um by

31
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:37,480
waiting for it to happen making time for it to happen and um and so the

32
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:44,519
self-organizing rather than the self organizing the you doing the organizing pulling everything together we're

33
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,080
sitting up we're we're staying here and just sensing feeling into it so we get

34
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:58,400
organized or oriented with all of who we are here and um this is a powerful thing

35
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,680
to do because otherwise we're partial otherwise we might be ahead of ourselves

36
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,120
we might be caught up in some concern we might be pushed around by The Winds of

37
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:18,959
the world which I talked about a few weeks ago or we pushed around by our fear our hatred or desires our anger

38
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,759
they take the lead and we become uh partial we become only part of us is

39
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:29,919
driving the show and for a wise life we we don't

40
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,199
want to have any one thing really driving the show we want everything to

41
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:43,320
be on the stage we want everything to becoming working together in a whole and so part of mindfulness part of

42
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:50,080
meditation is to be present for all of who we

43
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:57,000
are and allowing a natural process of self-organizing reorganizing coming

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,400
together bringing it all here and it doesn't require much except being

45
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,360
present being attentive feeling into it so maybe some of that this you'll feel

46
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:17,560
this next meditation will do so assuming a

47
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,199
posture that is the right posture for you that gives you a chance to begin

48
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:29,440
sensing and feeling as as much of the whole of who

49
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,720
you are in a balanced full

50
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:44,880
way so if you're slouching too much it may be fine to relax that way

51
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:52,400
but also it maybe doesn't really allow for everything to become alive everything to become vital

52
00:05:52,400 --> 00:06:00,199
here relaxing too much is too much the settling but not the reorg organizing

53
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,919
into a living field of your

54
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,400
Humanity so if you're sitting to sit up a little bit more

55
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,599
upright if you're lying down maybe there's some way to adjust your

56
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:24,840
spine how your shoulder blades are maybe against a

57
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,960
surface switching how your hands are your arms

58
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,000
even your legs maybe sometimes having your

59
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,560
legs up kind of bent with your leg feet closer into your

60
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:48,319
body can give a feeling of being more engaged in the

61
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,840
fullness of

62
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,680
ourselves lowering the Gaze

63
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,960
and gently closing the

64
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:17,800
eyes this process of feeling sensing giving time to know

65
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:25,520
what's here without needing to fix anything can begin when you take a few

66
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:34,560
long slow deep breaths where on the in inhale you feel the stronger Sensations

67
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,280
in the Torso that come from Deep the greater movement

68
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,840
expansion and then on the exhale to soften relax the body the

69
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,800
shoulders the belly

70
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,120
maybe the rib cage can relax and

71
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,919
settle if there's a place where your weight of your torso is most

72
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:33,039
centered maybe that place can relax and drop bit teeny

73
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,479
bit as you exhale

74
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:17,800
letting your breathing return to normal and with the

75
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,839
exhale relaxing more

76
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:30,320
physically relaxing gives time and space

77
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,120
to feel more fully so as you relax on the exhale feel

78
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,560
that part of your body a little bit more as you

79
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,640
inhale so relaxing your face

80
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:28,120
relaxing the shoulders on the exhale and feeling the shoulders on the

81
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:36,000
inhale and and the attitude as you feel the shoulders is an attitude of

82
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:46,160
inclusion allowing yourself to feel and sense how it is without needing it to be

83
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,440
different but then as you exhale you can make a little bit

84
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,120
different soften relax in the

85
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,279
shoulders and the same with the

86
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,440
chest relax the chest the Heart

87
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:30,639
Center feel it all on the inhale

88
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:42,440
as if it has permission to be that way just know it as if in the knowing and

89
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:52,519
feeling you're allowing the self-organizing movement of the body

90
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:16,680
and gently without trying too hard on the exhale softening the

91
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,160
belly and in this case as you breathe in

92
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,639
both feel the belly but see if there can continue to

93
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:41,240
be a little softening of the belly on the

94
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:50,439
exhale on the inhale keeping it soft

95
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,120
and then becoming [Music]

96
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:35,079
aware of a global awareness of your body not trying too

97
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:42,920
hard but being content to have the widest sense feeling of being in a

98
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,920
body

99
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:56,040
here maybe your attention gently roams around the

100
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,560
body maybe there's a panoramic sense of the

101
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:17,800
body and as you exhale letting the body relax

102
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:34,000
soften as you inhale feel and allow the sensations of

103
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,160
the

104
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:55,839
body as you feel the global panoramic

105
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:03,759
body you don't have to direct your attention any anywhere it can be almost like a

106
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,440
surprise the sensations that the body

107
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,519
shows and as you exhale gently soften

108
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,600
relax without ambition or trying too

109
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,959
hard the light

110
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
touch

111
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

112
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

113
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

114
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
e e

115
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,919
feeling your body on the

116
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,280
inhale settling the body on the exhale

117
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:11,200
where maybe you can feel the settling as a gathering a

118
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:24,480
recollecting of all parts of the body into the whole the global body

119
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:43,080
where the self organizing ability of the body as an

120
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:50,200
opportunity to include everything even what is

121
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
uncomfortable

122
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

123
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

124
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

125
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

126
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
e for

127
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:26,480
mindfulness is a lot to do with remembering to be present

128
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,480
recollecting reming the parts

129
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,480
together recollecting

130
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:13,000
Fuller awareness of the body on the inhale allowing it all to

131
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,720
recollect as you settle on the

132
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
exhale

133
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

134
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

135
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
e e

136
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,520
and then as we come to the end of the

137
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:47,120
sitting two and one more time on the inhale to

138
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:54,480
feel the whole body an expansion a growing of attention

139
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:01,039
on the inhale outward then beond on the

140
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,960
body not necessarily to feel what's

141
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,799
beyond but to open be available to feel and

142
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,960
sense the world around

143
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,720
you to feel

144
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:51,200
sense and there is a way when we take time to feel and

145
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,880
sense be aware of who or what's happening that allows for an

146
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:05,200
reorganizing coming together becoming more

147
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:13,360
whole that also allows others to become more

148
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:22,120
themselves allows others to collect and be themselves more

149
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:29,039
fully so people are not in conflict with themselves or in conflict with the world

150
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,600
World in such a way they become divided in

151
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:42,039
themselves cut off from part of themselves may it be that the practice

152
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:50,480
that we do supports others to be

153
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,679
whole supports others to

154
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:06,240
be aware of the fullness of who they are collected and organized

155
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:15,480
unified undivided and in that way to be

156
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:23,760
free may all beings be happy may all

157
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,519
beings be safe may all be

158
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:37,278
beings be peaceful may all beings be

159
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,679
free and may the way that we are

160
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:59,080
whole inclusive all of who we are is included here

161
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,278
help others to feel free and

162
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:18,778
[Music]

163
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:30,960
safe thank you for

164
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:25,320
so hello and welcome to this second talk on not making it

165
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:33,559
worse so um one of the principles of mindfulness

166
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:41,919
practice is to in a wise way and particular way to not avoid not turn

167
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:49,480
away from things but rather uh to turn towards them and

168
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:58,159
compost them transform them if they're unhealthy or inappropriate or somehow off

169
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,399
so symbolically we're doing this this week with uh the word worse so don't

170
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:08,760
make it worse that's so that's what we want to avoid doing is to make it worse

171
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:15,200
but there's the the art of actually turning towards what's worse and in

172
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:22,840
doing so to become wise about it to allow it to change to allow it to not

173
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,799
run us or be in charge of us and find our freedom and maybe even transform it

174
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:36,159
into something that's much better so symbolically we're doing this with taking the word worse and rather

175
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,799
than avoiding it turning towards it and making it into an acronym for something that's

176
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:47,120
better so yesterday uh the W was presented as

177
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,320
wait uh be patient be give time uh wait

178
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,480
and allow and really uh take time to really in the waiting for something to

179
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,679
change and move that helps us understand better how to respond what to do helps

180
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:10,760
us take in the bigger picture the second for today the O is um

181
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:16,799
to organize organize ourselves and uh or Orient ourselves to

182
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:26,080
kind of the fullness the wholeness of who we are but to organize um uh if we're caught up in the

183
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:33,360
in activities that are making a situ situation worse for example if we're angry or filled with greed or caught up

184
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:40,200
in really a lot of anxiety that um and so and uh that kind

185
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:47,679
of uh tends to contract and narrow the focus of attention to the particular

186
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,799
thing we're concerned about it might be thoughts and stories and imaginations

187
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:59,840
that are producing the fear the anger the hatred the uh the strong greed uh it

188
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,559
might be the feeling the emotions or the sensations of those emotions themselves those

189
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:11,480
impulses uh motivations themselves which has us narrowed and caught

190
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,878
up uh and um and so um and so we're

191
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:23,720
people be becom partial all of us is not included and to wait and then allow the

192
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,960
system to organize to allow the different parts that have been been uh

193
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,200
disconnected because we're narrowed we're tight we're ignoring we're pretending it's not there sometimes

194
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:42,158
there's difficult emotions difficult states of mind that we don't want to look at and we're trying to override it

195
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,200
by doing activities which distracts us from it but those difficulties the

196
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:54,638
tensions that we carry with us are still there and we're just happily ignoring them and the more we can be distracted

197
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:00,400
by doing exciting things fascinating things things um the more relief we get

198
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,480
because we're avoiding successfully what's happening the idea of avoiding who we

199
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:15,520
are Keeps Us partial keeps us not collected as a whole and so um so uh but when we can

200
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,280
become more whole when we're aware of more the fullness of all the different parts of

201
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,720
ourselves um then we have more information we have more understanding

202
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:34,599
we have more capacity to respond wisely to respond in ways that's beneficial for

203
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:43,359
ourselves and for others because we start knowing what is beneficial where am I hurt where am I afraid how do I now

204
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:50,680
include this in a wise way and um what is my greed what is my desire what's

205
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:57,880
driving that and maybe there's a wise way to respond to that where's my fear

206
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:05,319
and uh how can I be wise and engaged and fully here in the situation making my being safe but also

207
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:12,640
being present wholly to it and so this organizing and um and uh what happens

208
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:19,960
when we start getting organized uh meaning we start collecting gathering together all of who we are so

209
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:26,160
we can all be here in the wholeness I'll be here in the if we you allow me to say

210
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,480
kind of the the um the basket of awareness the basket that holds it off

211
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,960
or the CED hands of awareness that the cup hands that gently holds all of who

212
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,560
we are uh then uh things or have a chance

213
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:49,520
to organize and shift around and gather together and we have a remarkable

214
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:56,640
ability for self-healing or uh the you know just like a cut and a hand or a finger will

215
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,640
self-heal if we allow it to if we keep it clean and and don't interfere with that healing

216
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,200
process uh all kinds of difficult emotions sadness and grief at times can

217
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:13,599
be self-healing if we allow it to um to

218
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:20,839
have space and not interfere with it and not believe it or push it away or uh be

219
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:26,960
aversive to it there's a whole inner process um that can operate for us that

220
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,839
moves us towards psychological and spiritual health uh if we can learn the

221
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:38,000
art of holding it all in a wider field of

222
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,240
awareness and so uh I call this for today giving time for us to get

223
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:52,400
organized uh pulling oursel together putting ourselves together again after being discombobulated being stressed

224
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,920
being uh disconnected to ourselves so reconnect

225
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,480
and um and the important thing that can happen there as I've said we get to have

226
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:12,680
much more information we tend to be wiser we tend to connect to deeper sources of understanding within us uh as

227
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,440
we get more more collected if we're narrow and uncollected and fragmented

228
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:26,000
and discombobulated uh the source of our understanding tends to be um coming out

229
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,119
of the reactivity itself coming out of um

230
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:37,319
maybe beliefs that we hold that can feel very real and very true but are so

231
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:45,560
partial so narrow so maybe projections and Fantasies or uh made up ideas that

232
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:53,560
we don't really see fully what's happening here and um and uh not a few times I've

233
00:38:53,560 --> 00:39:00,280
had ideas about other people that those ideas seem so true and maybe some of it

234
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:05,680
actually was true because I was picking up a particular part of a person but as

235
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,760
I became recollected settled of myself more organized myself back and pulled

236
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,920
myself together lo and behold uh I was able to see the other person more as

237
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:24,680
whole as well I was able to see more of the person than the particular small

238
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,880
little lens that I was so focused on as if that was the whole

239
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:37,319
person and so it becomes a gift that we can give the whole world when we become

240
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:43,640
take time to allow the system to get organized and collected and the way that mindfulness

241
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:49,839
works is we don't have to so much be the one who does the

242
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:56,160
recollecting except in being aware of what's here it's the awareness of what's

243
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,839
here feeling being present sensing oh here too and one of the tools for this

244
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:09,960
is breathing as we kind of stay with the breathing it's one of the ways that the

245
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:16,880
more with with our breathing the less we're caught up in our thoughts the less we're caught up in our narrow world of

246
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:23,640
projections and preoccupations the more we less we're fixated on particular um

247
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:29,000
motivations particular orientations particular emotions there's something

248
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,560
that the Simplicity of breathing not always but sometimes can help free us

249
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:40,800
from the preoccupations of the Mind free us just enough that we start taking in

250
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,040
more of what's Happening Here and then with that breathing there's it can be

251
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:53,359
the Art of Letting the breathing begin to massage the body or help us feel more

252
00:40:53,359 --> 00:41:00,640
connected to the body to settle and relax into the body and so much of this process of

253
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,839
reorganizing is an embodied process the more we can feel take time to sense and

254
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:13,960
be with the body the that's where the system comes into a hole if we try to

255
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:20,200
think our way into the hole if we try to just use our mental powers to imagine or

256
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:27,560
to that then it doesn't really happen uh we are if we become whole and organized

257
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:36,800
as a collective um it has to include our body and it's not our raw bones and

258
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:44,240
muscles body it's the body of our nervous system the body of uh that

259
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:51,640
allows us to sense and feel and interact with all its different parts that spreads out throughout all these nerves

260
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:57,720
that we have throughout the body it's how we experience the body

261
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:06,240
and uh and as soon as we're tuned into how we're experiencing the body we're tuned into this amazing

262
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,319
network of nerves this amazing net of U

263
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:19,400
ways that information and understanding and wisdom operates in this system of ours so it's being aware of your body is

264
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:25,559
not just being aware of this kind of hunk of Flesh it's becoming aware of

265
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:31,839
this amazing nervous system um that spreads throughout the body that is

266
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:38,920
intelligent um probably we should think of it as as intelligent as the

267
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:46,880
brain or collectively organized together the whole expansive sense of the nervous

268
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:54,079
system in the body the nerves the network of nerves together with our brain creates for

269
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:00,599
greater intelligence because it's the the nervous system then is also becoming

270
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:10,559
whole so wait and and organize take time to let

271
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:17,720
yourself get reorganized pull yourself together settled in Wake up in the

272
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:24,359
body that's the second way to not make it worse and um if you take just that time

273
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:30,520
to do that then you're certainly not acting on what makes it worse you're

274
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,720
pausing but you're doing something even more important is that you're beginning

275
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:42,400
to to gather yourself together so more of this wisdom and more of this empathy

276
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,839
and more of this compassion and love and kindness that we can have for our common

277
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:55,559
Humanity as a chance to operate and we're becoming less likely to make the situation

278
00:43:55,559 --> 00:44:03,760
worse so thank you and I hope that uh you explore on these next 24 hours um

279
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,920
how you can go through the day to take these sacred pauses sacred times of

280
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:15,640
waiting not just to wait and and endure but to wait so you can feel more What's

281
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:24,119
Happening Here for yourself and this self-organizing way in which we become more complete um can be a wonderful

282
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:31,400
Discovery for you and a Ben a benefit thank you
