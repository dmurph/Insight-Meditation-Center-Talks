1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,920
so hello

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:22,080
and welcome and

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,000
it occurred to me that i'm for teaching i'm teaching about thinking

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,879
this week and coming to the end and somehow i happily

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,640
don't have many thoughts about this topic at the moment

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,440
the i feel pretty content

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,840
so to

8
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,320
not need anything

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,400
to sit upright meditate and let go of needs

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,840
expectations let go of

11
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,758
it needing to be any particular way

12
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,680
to be here with the simplicity of being

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,000
with whatever is here including the complications

14
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:50,000
so lowering the gaze 45 degrees to the floor perhaps

15
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,799
relaxing the gaze lose focus not really looking at anything in

16
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:07,240
particular and then closing the eyes

17
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,520
and to be here with this body

18
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:38,640
this body that we have that we are that we're in

19
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,400
this body that just is

20
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:51,840
can be like the temple that we enter

21
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,760
and we can enter it with our deeper breathing

22
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,640
breathing in fully allowing the rib cage to expand

23
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,760
if you deep breathe deep enough it lifts the shoulders a bit

24
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,719
with a full deep in-breath even the belly might expand outward

25
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,560
and then on the exhale to relax all that

26
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,840
to release

27
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,640
maybe at the end of the exhale to let your elbows kind of flap a little bit

28
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,519
swing a little bit so that there's a looseness in the arms

29
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,280
letting the breathing return to normal

30
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,920
and continuing to relax

31
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,480
softening the muscles of the face

32
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,759
releasing the shoulders as you exhale

33
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:53,120
softening the belly as you exhale and maybe also softening it on the

34
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,120
inhale

35
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,560
feeling the touch of your clothes against your skin your skin against the clothes

36
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,960
and relaxing all along that meeting place of

37
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,720
skin and clothes relax soften

38
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:11,039
and gently on the exhale relax the core of your being

39
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,479
the most deepest tender place within allow it to trust

40
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,160
enough to relax to soften

41
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,280
and then there's the thinking muscle whatever tension or pressure

42
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,000
contraction that you might feel associated with thinking

43
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,319
it might be physical it might be

44
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:15,639
a mental tension whatever it might be

45
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,639
as you exhale soften it

46
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,080
let it become calmer

47
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,599
maybe letting go of any need to think

48
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,639
the pressure to think

49
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:01,199
the interest in thinking put it aside for now

50
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,160
so your thoughts can float away like thought bubbles

51
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,120
blowing away in the wind

52
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:38,039
one of the thoughts to let go of is any thoughts connected to time

53
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:48,080
even thinking about the end of the next breath is to be involved in time

54
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,440
do not have thoughts about time

55
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,839
it allows each passing thing to exist while it's present

56
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,800
as if it's there forever

57
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:22,440
in the quiet stillness of the of the mind

58
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,839
each in breath moments in forever

59
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,519
no time each part of the exhale

60
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,959
fully there itself no time forever

61
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,480
breathing in breathing out

62
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,880
no in no out just sensations

63
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,079
appearing and disappearing

64
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,160
and when there is no time no appearing and disappearing

65
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:33,240
just is each moment

66
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,720
loosening up on your thinking

67
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,520
let it become calmer and quieter

68
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,720
let yourself very gently think about

69
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,320
here just here

70
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:27,400
letting go into here let that be the content of your thinking

71
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:58,640
and now [Music] letting your thoughts be quiet and

72
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,039
soft calm thinking

73
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:10,880
have your thinking remember a time that

74
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:18,320
you received someone's care good will

75
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,840
kindness that was touching for you

76
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,240
heart softening

77
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,919
where something inside of you resonated with that care that kindness

78
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:58,080
or think of a time that you were caring and kind that was meaningful for you the feeling

79
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,720
the way it arose lived in you

80
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,840
quiet thoughts simple relax think they're thinking to remember

81
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:21,240
how it felt in the body the mind the heart

82
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,360
what was inspiring about that for you

83
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,679
and then quietly calmly

84
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:52,159
see if you can have thoughts in your own way of thinking

85
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,399
of good will kindness

86
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,360
for others people you know in your life people you

87
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,080
run into strangers

88
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,640
very simple ordinary

89
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:22,919
attitude of kindness and goodwill and what kind of thoughts would accompany that

90
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,000
what place in the heart or with what place inside

91
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,480
might be awakened with such

92
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,000
thoughts of good will of kindness

93
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,559
when the mind is quiet

94
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,000
it can be a meaningful time to think

95
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,840
wholesome thoughts beneficial thoughts

96
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,039
especially at the end of the meditation

97
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,600
to prepare yourself to go into the world

98
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:47,200
with a caring heart may all beings

99
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,360
be happy may all beings

100
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:01,760
be safe may all beings be peaceful

101
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,039
may all beings be free

102
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,440
and may you share in that happiness

103
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,398
and peace and freedom

104
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,759
may all beings be happy

105
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:37,650
[Music]

106
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,960
so we come now to the last talk on mindfulness of thinking

107
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:06,000
and as i've said mindfulness of thinking thinking is just as much of a

108
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,840
valid subject for mindfulness as anything else including the breathing

109
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:18,159
the art of it however is that to think to be mindful without thinking

110
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:26,640
more not be think fullness because you're mindful of thinking

111
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,080
and uh the um

112
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,200
and so usually uh the breathing is often a very good focus for meditation

113
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,240
because it tends to be calming and settling and it's not it's a physical sensation

114
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:51,919
so it tends to kind of help us kind of step out of the world of thinking so that can quiet down

115
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,440
the so thinking maybe isn't always a good

116
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,559
object for beginners because it pulls us into itself we start thinking more and more

117
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:08,799
but on principle thinking is just as valid as a subject of mindfulness as anything else

118
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,720
we turn our attention towards it and sooner or later it's really wise to do it

119
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,880
to especially if you've been meditating for a long time and you have some ability to just really

120
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:27,120
look at thinking and see it and look it right in the eye and and study what goes on in it

121
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:33,919
it's a whole systems a whole complex of things that are involved with the thinking that come

122
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:39,360
into play and one of those things is our clinging

123
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:45,519
our grasping or holding on our stickiness our compulsive

124
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:51,120
compulsivity we're thinking and

125
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,039
and in the end we're not looking to stop having thoughts

126
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,240
freedom is manifested in not having that stickiness with

127
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,840
thoughts not clinging to thoughts and having a state of mind a consciousness and

128
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,559
awareness which is has released itself from thinking

129
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:20,720
even if thinking still goes on and for this purpose i distinguish between thinking

130
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,720
and thoughting thoughting is just what the mind does the mind is a thoughting machine just

131
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,640
middle just produce thoughts they float up and float away thinking

132
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:39,360
is when we're involved in those thoughts when there's little bit and sometimes it's appropriate to be involved

133
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:47,120
but more often than not when we're involved there is a some compulsivity some clinging some grasping to it

134
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,880
and so to study thinking to as a way of discovering where

135
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,279
grasping and thing is where clinging is and as a kind of

136
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:03,760
a fascinating

137
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:12,720
window into the clinging into thoughts whenever you're in a hurry

138
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,839
chances are pretty high that

139
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:25,919
um your thinking is compulsive your thinking has scrapped onto something holding on

140
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:31,919
the the the syndrome of hurry hurriedness usually comes along with hurried

141
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:38,158
thoughts pushing thoughts wanting thoughts crowded thoughts one after the other

142
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:44,158
and uh and as and not only is the mind kind of crowded with a lot of thoughts when we

143
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:51,839
hurry but sometimes they're they're you can feel the push the compulsivity

144
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:57,760
if you allow yourself to feel it there's a kind of command from hurry

145
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:04,920
like don't pay attention to itself just get the job done do what has to be done so to turn around

146
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:12,800
180 degrees and look at thinking itself is a real task

147
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:20,960
the um and so in terms of hurrying it's possible to do things quickly

148
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,400
without hurrying so hurry is this extra kind of

149
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,680
compulsivity this being caught in something that has to be done quickly

150
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:38,320
it's possible to do things quickly without being caught so one of the things we're looking for

151
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,640
in in the dharma is not to be without thinking

152
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,200
or without thoughts but to be with them without clinging to them

153
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,480
and now this is a very profound thing because

154
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:04,560
that's all we ever cling to when there's clinging unless you're you know at the edge of a cliff holding on

155
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:12,320
clinging to the railing um you know then it's you clinging to the railing but generally the the clinging

156
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,839
that we're addressing in buddhism is the uh the the predominant clinging

157
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:22,880
that human beings are involved in all the time and that is we're clinging to ideas and

158
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,839
thoughts that's really what we cling to

159
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,839
we don't see it that way because if i'm clinging to

160
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,119
a person i think i'm clinging to that person

161
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,560
but if you're really quiet and study your mind you see you're not clinging to the person unless you're holding their

162
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:51,200
hand tight you're clinging to the idea that person is in your mind

163
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,400
the associations you have the meanings you have the value you have around that person the desires you have around that

164
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:04,160
person it's it's the clinging to ideas to thoughts and to start seeing that is fascinating

165
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,960
so you know the recipe is not the same thing as a meal

166
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,280
to cling to the recipe and never cook you never have a meal

167
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,838
to a map is not the territory

168
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,720
i had a when i was a new relatively young zen student i had some challenge with my when my father

169
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,960
enough so i talked to my zen teacher about it and and he made this comment to me which

170
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,200
really struck me he said before your father was a father

171
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,880
there was before he was a father he was a person without any fatherhood any being a

172
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,880
father and when he said that i said wow i'm only seeing him through the lens of

173
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:03,280
being my father he has a whole other side of him of how he lives his life without

174
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,440
being a father i wonder who he is i wonder how he is there in those situations

175
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,359
and um so um the

176
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:21,839
you know we hold on to these ideas of how it is so there's a kind of a cliche kind of a little saying that came from i

177
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:30,640
think manindraji this uh indian vipasta teacher who was a teacher for many of us i i just knew him briefly

178
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:37,920
and he said um the thoughts of your mother are not your mother

179
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:46,160
so we have these thoughts these ideas and we to release our thoughts

180
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,599
from our grasping and clinging and here's a very interesting idea

181
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,520
that you know in buddhism the goal is consensus liberation is freedom

182
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,800
and often the idea we're holding on to is that

183
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:10,240
i will be free when i'm liberated but maybe it doesn't work that way

184
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:16,000
maybe you will never be free those are just ideas and thoughts

185
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,599
if anything what's happening is you're giving freedom

186
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:28,720
to the world you give freedom to your thoughts not to think wildly and recklessly and

187
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:35,200
unwholesomely the the reckless the thoughts the unwholesome thoughts the harmful

188
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,960
thoughts that we think are a form of clinging we're holding on

189
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,560
to idea to something without clinging to anything

190
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,760
the thoughts will gravitate will flow towards what is wholesome

191
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,680
what's immediate because it's not driven by desires by hatreds and all this stuff

192
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,760
so rather than you becoming free you're giving freedom to your thoughts

193
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,520
and to have thoughts be free it's one of the great delights to have thoughts just kind of

194
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:16,000
relaxingly just appear it's kind of like a miracle that thoughts appear

195
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,319
where do they come from they just kind of you know to be quiet and still and watch a new thought be

196
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:27,440
born where did that come from it just arises and floats by and goes

197
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,720
away and and it's not any different than a flower blooming and fading

198
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:40,800
it's not any different than the clouds forming in the skies and passing by

199
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:47,839
it's not any different than a leaf floating in the wind hovering and finally landing someplace

200
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:53,440
they um if we don't identify with the thoughts

201
00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:00,000
to identify with a thought is to be attached to little kind of identification thoughts this is me this

202
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,040
is mine to not make thoughts me myself and mine

203
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,319
is so wonderful to not have to take them personally

204
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:17,200
to not have to do anything with them to not have to measure oneself by it when i was

205
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,640
about 14 or so 13 or 14 my father took me aside to have a little father-son

206
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,880
talk and he said to me i don't know if it was that intentional but he said to me

207
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,520
as you grow up from time to time you'll have bizarre thoughts and i kind of

208
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:41,280
okay i thought okay i mean i didn't know what to do with that information and

209
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,640
and lo and behold some point or other i had bizarre thoughts

210
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,440
and i said oh my father told me about this that this might happen and because of that i had no indic no

211
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:59,599
inclination to do anything about them or to judge them or to be horrified by them or whatever i don't

212
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,440
you know whatever they were i don't even remember but they were just oh it just bizarre thoughts

213
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:12,319
just they come and they go thoughts are kind of like a dime a dozen they come and they go

214
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:19,280
and the ability to step back from them and not automatically latch onto them

215
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:26,400
is a kind of a power because it allows us to choose which thoughts we getting involved in

216
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:33,200
and which we don't and that is where maybe a certain kind of freedom resides

217
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:39,200
the freedom to choose what we think and the primary choice that i think that

218
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,599
we learned in this practice is mostly what not to do what not to think oh and i don't need to do that i

219
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:52,079
don't need to do that sometimes it's very very appropriate to actually choose what we think about like

220
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:58,079
at the end of the meditation spend a little time choosing to think about goodwill and kindness

221
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:05,440
it's so it has a double purpose it has a purpose of helping us stay free

222
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,960
to open the heart and not cling and just open ourselves and be available to the world in a kind way

223
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,520
kind of you know hopefully clears the decks of our hearts so that we can kind of

224
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:24,560
just be available for the world and we're not clinging and holding on to me myself and mine

225
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,839
and it nourishes something very important in us and

226
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:35,040
it supports and helps other people all those can happen that dedication of

227
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,480
our thinking that way but the thinking needs to be done in a free way

228
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:47,040
in a relaxed way easy way calmly and to learn how to think

229
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:54,160
some of us need to relearn our thinking but first to learn how to be free of

230
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:01,359
thoughts to release them so may you explore study

231
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,960
ride the edge of where you can find ways to not cling to your thinking

232
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:14,078
and you don't necessarily have to let go of your thoughts just let go of the clinging and see what happens

233
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:23,480
and um so releasing thoughts

234
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:31,280
so then um next week i'll continue this series on kind of the basic mindfulness practice

235
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:38,560
and i'm going to talk about now something that what called mindfulness of mind

236
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:44,400
and um and so that's uh we'll continue with

237
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:52,880
with this momentum that we have over the last four weeks so thank you very very much and i

238
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,160
look forward to monday
