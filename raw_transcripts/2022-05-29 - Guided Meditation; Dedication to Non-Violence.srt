00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,240
hello everyone and welcome to imc

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,480
and we'll just start with a meditation directly

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,320
so to prepare yourself

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,360
by sitting here with respect

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,000
for yourself with a kindness and care

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,239
for your own welfare perhaps so that later

7
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,480
you might be able to offer respect and kindness and care to others

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:01,120
and to think of meditation as a act of

9
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,159
self-respect self-care self-kindness

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,720
in such a way that it feels welcoming for you

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,159
to be present to be here at this time at this place with your

12
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:28,240
attention that your attention is the vehicle

13
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,400
for which care kindness

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,840
respect can be present

15
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,200
gently closing the eyes

16
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,600
and perhaps with some long slow deep breaths it's a way of

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:09,240
both connecting to yourself and as you exhale clearing away

18
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,720
whatever it is that might interfere

19
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,120
with present moment awareness

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,640
so and letting your breathing return to

21
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,640
normal

22
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,659
relaxing in your body [Music]

23
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,840
softening

24
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,000
perhaps with the health help of your breathing softening whatever is hard in

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
you

26
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,879
meeting with care and kindness whatever is difficult in you

27
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,200
um

28
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:23,759
at the end of the exhale as the inhale believe begins

29
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,600
perhaps you can evoke the kind of awareness attention which

30
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,960
has a quality of clarity just

31
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,639
clear awareness here

32
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,880
with the beginning of each inhale

33
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,960

34
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,880

so

88
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,840
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

89
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:38,360
where would you connect to inside of yourself

90
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:46,080
if you were going to gaze out on the world

91
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,440
with respect with care

92
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:00,960
with kindness where would that come from in you

93
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,398
from the heart from deep

94
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,280
in your torso

95
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:23,200
below the layers of fear anger despair

96
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,919
is there a home for compassion

97
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:38,720
for care for respect of others

98
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:48,878
and if there is to now at the end of the sitting to gaze

99
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:54,158
out metaphorically gaze out upon the world

100
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,760
and evoke a good will for this world of ours

101
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,359
wishing well to others

102
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,720
may all beings be free of suffering

103
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,960
may others be free of oppression violence

104
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,720
maybe they may they be free of hate

105
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:40,800
disrespect may all beings

106
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:49,520
live in safety in mutual respect

107
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,079
may all beings be happy and free

108
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:04,200
and may it be that we can contribute to that being possible

109
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:20,590
[Music]

110
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,400
okay

111
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,359
so hello everyone who's here at time c welcome and to those of you who are

112
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:55,078
online welcome as well and um

113
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:15,359
i'm thinking about how there are two sources within us

114
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:20,079
for how we act in the world

115
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,079
how we react in the world respond in the world

116
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:33,040
and one is more what i can consider more on the surface and one is from our depths some place

117
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:40,720
deep inside and the surface i i associate with

118
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:47,119
responding reacting to the world when the events of the world

119
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,400
come to us and it meets our fear

120
00:37:52,480 --> 00:38:00,079
or our anger or despair or hopelessness

121
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,720
our greed and all those things i think of more surface

122
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:14,720
partly because they usually involved a lot of thinking imagination of ideas and desires

123
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:20,480
and they also are more activated state

124
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:29,440
the depth within us is to allow something deeper inside of us to respond to be touched by the world

125
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,000
that's that is deeper than whatever fear and despair anger he might have

126
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,119
maybe when those things their the fear and anger despair

127
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:47,440
have settled and quieted greed has settled away

128
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:54,640
enough so that we feel a sense of satisfaction and and warmth and

129
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:02,320
pleasure and happiness in life in a deeper way without needing

130
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,640
the world to be a certain way where we feel at ease and feel

131
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,119
at home in a deep way and so there's a different sensitivity is that

132
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,480
we in which we receive the world the difficulties

133
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,920
that other things that are i think deeper inside and maybe easily eclipsed by the

134
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,839
surface can emerge and rather than

135
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:37,520
reacting we respond rather than reacting

136
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,560
we we something emerges from the heart

137
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:48,960
merges from deeper deeper inside that where we can we feel our shared

138
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,359
humanity where we can feel and see other people for their humanity

139
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,800
that's very hard to see if we're reacting from the surface if we're

140
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,720
seeing through the fear through hate through greed through despair

141
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:13,280
through a sense of hopelessness helplessness and so to

142
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:20,880
be able to kind of tap into some deeper place within is a hugely important part of meditation

143
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,000
buddhist practice and some of the guidelines for how to

144
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,760
live like a life that the buddha gives make a lot of sense or there's a lot of

145
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,280
there's a they they resonates much deeper inside of us

146
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:46,720
if uh uh if we're in the touch to this in touch with this depth inside of us

147
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:55,200
so one of the guidelines one of the kind of precepts of buddhism or maybe the first precept is not to kill

148
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:04,319
and and the kind of the primary principle

149
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,400
they're associated to that and the principle that underlies all the buddhism i believe is

150
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,079
not to harm the principle of non-harming living a life of non-harming

151
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,440
and i want to talk about this a little bit today because of recent events you

152
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,720
know it seems like two uh you know two weeks ago we had this

153
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:33,839
horrific shooting in in buffalo and a market called tom's friendly

154
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:40,400
market and 10 black americans were shot just

155
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,680
shopping and that was the motivation for the talk

156
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,960
last week on on hate it was a hate crime

157
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,280
and uh and then just five days ago we had this uh horrendous

158
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:04,720
another horrendous shooting of children 19 children and others were killed

159
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,318
in texas and uh

160
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,838
and you know we've had a lot of shootings school shootings in this country

161
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,560
and so what happens when these kinds of events are allowed to

162
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,720
touch something deep inside is there a place that's deeper than anger

163
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,960
deeper than fear deeper than despair deeper than

164
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:43,680
then is there someplace deeper not to dismiss those reactions and those

165
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,838
responses because they're so human so

166
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:55,119
you know so so much of how people respond to things but what happens do we have access to

167
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,680
some place deeper and i think that's the call one of the

168
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:09,359
calls of buddhist practice because of the first precept in this first principle of not killing and not harming

169
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:17,280
to the the call of buddhists is to see how can we come from that place

170
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:24,079
how can we be dedicated and committed to non-harming in a radical way in a

171
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,839
thorough way how could we be champions of not killing not just not

172
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:34,880
killing ourselves because the buddha also taught

173
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:41,440
that or encouraged more than just

174
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:48,640
not harming not killing but advocating

175
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:55,359
for others not to kill as well or inspiring others not to kill

176
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:01,680
to cultivate maybe a culture of not killing

177
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:08,640
and so how do we you know change this human tremendous

178
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,119
momentum of a culture that has so much you know has so much momentum in

179
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,800
violence in killing after the killings in texas there was in

180
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,760
the news reports of uh that the manufacturer of the gun that

181
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:35,040
was used the company called uh daniel defense

182
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:41,040
that they had a uh advertisement which i then found on their website

183
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:48,640
uh the but you can't see the face but uh clearly a young child is my guess is uh

184
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:54,480
four or five years old with a semi-automatic rifle

185
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,160
on his lap and uh

186
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:06,560
and uh you know just resting there and he has a t-shirt that says a rascal on it

187
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:13,040
that seems to diminish or kind of make light of or kind of suggest something very different about

188
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,960
what it means to own or possess a and a semi-automatic rifle but then even

189
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:27,200
more remarkable is the statement that goes along with that you know together with the advertisement

190
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:35,359
train up a child in the way he should go train up a child in the way he should go

191
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:40,640
and when he is old he will not depart from it

192
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:47,839
start them early with semi-automatic rifles

193
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:52,960
so here's a company a business trying to promote the

194
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,800
sale of their rifles so this is not neces i don't know if

195
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:05,119
they're operating out of some kind of strange idea of compassion for our society

196
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:12,800
but it seems to me like they're operating under wanting to make business wanting to sell

197
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:19,760
and trying to hook people in and so the momentum of some of the

198
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:26,720
economic forces in the society that's advertising

199
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,000
a culture of violence

200
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,920
how do we do something different where does that come from

201
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:45,920
so in the in the description of the first precept the kind of the little bit longer description of it

202
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,000
one abstains from killing

203
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,400
one lays down weapons and swords

204
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:07,200
a modest compassionate

205
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:14,720
dwelling with care for the welfare of all beings

206
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,720
so it isn't just killing there's more that's involved with much more that's involved and these are

207
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:27,040
beautiful qualities i'm inspired by some people who put down their weapons

208
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:33,599
throw them away for me

209
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:39,760
that creates a different culture a culture of people who are not going to

210
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:45,760
succumb to fear greed or conceit or arrogance

211
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,880
and one of the worst ways of i think of responding to the violence in

212
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:58,319
the world is to allow the fear that it elicits to get the

213
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:04,800
upper hand in such a way that we go out and buy another gun

214
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,480
then we just kind of perpetuate more there is a

215
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,800
story from japan or a historical event maybe it's slightly interpretive the way

216
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:22,880
i'm going to present it to you but uh in the somewhere i don't know when in

217
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:28,160
this the fifth sixth century in in japan

218
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:33,920
uh there were in the in the val in the valley that's surrounded by mountains

219
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:40,880
that's now kyoto they were building buddhist temples and there was a capital

220
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:48,400
and uh and there was this um idea that evil spirits forces

221
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:56,720
would be coming out of the northeast corner of that valley down the mountains and somehow come and harm

222
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,839
the capital so to protect the capital

223
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:07,119
they built a buddhist a temple up there in the northeast kind of like

224
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:14,240
and they would do rituals and practices and somehow have the dharmic protection

225
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:21,200
and that monastery grew and developed to be one of the biggest monasteries in japan

226
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:27,520
over the centuries at some point they became so big it became like i think it was probably also

227
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,559
like a landlord you know like a big estate and

228
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:38,800
and uh they had uh some kind of monks i don't know exactly what kind of monks they were

229
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:44,640
who were soldiers and at some point

230
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:50,559
that was the evil force that came out of the northeast down to kyoto

231
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:57,280
to attack kyoto to take over so it was a it was a self-fulfilling

232
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,640
prophecy that there's danger let's protect us with the

233
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:09,200
let's have monks up there who can harm themselves and be soldiers and and it became so powerful

234
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:14,800
that that came around so it's a kind of a

235
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,839
you know i don't know if we want to take too much of a lesson from that but certainly an example

236
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:25,040
of uh sometimes living with fear and

237
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:30,160
uh off you know in kind of in a reactive mode

238
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:35,200
can elicit the very thing that we're trying to avoid

239
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,640
a more contemporary statement of this is uh

240
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:47,200
saying what i'm trying to say here today is from martin luther king

241
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:54,720
the ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral

242
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:01,200
begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy instead of diminishing evil it

243
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:07,119
multiplies it through violence you murder the hater

244
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:14,480
but you do not murder hate in fact violence merely increases hate

245
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:21,040
returning violence for violence multiplies violence adding deeper darkness to a night

246
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,800
already devoid of stars darkness cannot drive out darkness

247
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:32,640
only light can do that hate cannot drive out hate only love can

248
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,799
do that

249
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:44,400
so i don't know you know there's all kinds of things being said now and

250
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,839
and almost every time there's some mass shooting like [Applause]

251
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:54,880
many of the same things get said about what should happen and

252
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:00,160
analysis of our culture and our society and that's

253
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:06,319
it's it's kind of a kind of this is very sad to kind of think that here we're

254
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:12,960
saying the same thing over the repetition of this is kind of phenomenal so i don't want to repeat some of the

255
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:18,559
cultural ideas societal ideas that are so common they said

256
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:23,599
but i i do feel inspired to evoke

257
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:30,400
the importance of non-harming and not killing in a buddhist life

258
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,480
and that learning how to do this in a wise way

259
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,079
learning how to do this so that we can protect ourselves better that way

260
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,960
than we can through violence

261
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:53,920
it's not an obvious and easy thing to naively say you know we should be non-violent

262
00:52:53,920 --> 00:53:01,440
when there are dangers in this world it doesn't work but are there ways resources

263
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:07,680
that we can do to prepare ourselves and have other responses that come out of our

264
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:13,520
compassion that help us be safe help us live well

265
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:21,280
help us not perpetuate fear not perpetuate fear despair

266
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:27,760
or sense of hopelessness with all this and one of the reasons why

267
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,720
to do this is to

268
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:40,720
is to radiate from ourselves hopefully a cultural change

269
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:46,240
so much of what's this uh you know the the roots of violence

270
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:52,800
in this country as we see some of it comes from hate

271
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,920
some of it like with this uh last one in the school shooting in texas

272
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,480
this 18 year old who committed this horrendous

273
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:10,640
killings he was bullied apparently he had a stutter and a lisp

274
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:16,720
and other things and he had a mother who was a drug addict and and it probably had a very difficult

275
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:22,319
life you know and bullying is horrible especially if you're already at home

276
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:29,359
have a difficult life and no place of refuge

277
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:36,319
so the movements of bullying is not that something to be taken lightly

278
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:42,640
i've had parents who tell me that they went to the school to try to deal with the bullying of their

279
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:49,200
child at school and and the principals were not that interested in doing anything

280
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:55,359
but look you know we have to respond but how do we respond kindly

281
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:02,400
what happens we've had correctional systems

282
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,760
that you know put people in jail and they become worse in jail than they were when

283
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:13,599
they before they went in because of how terribly and disrespectfully they're treated we don't

284
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:21,480
call it bullying by the guards but the guards can treat people horrendously

285
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,720
i met a man when i was in san quentin who had spent 24 years in solitary confinement

286
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:34,000
can you believe that that's possible in this in california in a state prison 24

287
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:41,599
years and uh and so you know to perhaps perpetuate

288
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:49,440
and and the very system that's supposed to be a correctional system doesn't correct it makes things worse

289
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:56,880
so to um but what do we do and what we do as buddhists

290
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:02,240
among the many things you can do but is to really appreciate and find a

291
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:10,559
way to love certainly others but love non-violence

292
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:15,599
love not causing harm love it because

293
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:22,319
it protects you it protects the best that's in you that protects something that's wonderful

294
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:29,599
and beautiful and rich and and satisfying and and worth worth

295
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:36,319
coming from a way that provides a meaningful life that doesn't depend

296
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:42,079
on things which are relatively superficial but comes in like from a heart that's

297
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:47,119
full and and satisfied or delighted and

298
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:53,280
rich to do this practice not just to restrain

299
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,640
from love restraint from killing but as the rest of the

300
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:06,400
teaching goes uh to be certain kind of modesty i'm not clear

301
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:12,799
exactly what that is but what got some kind of modesty compassion

302
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:17,040
and care for the welfare of everyone

303
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:26,920
the uh it's interesting that the the buddhas presented kind of an analysis of

304
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:33,040
how rulers can care for people

305
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:38,160
it's an ancient myth that the buddha kind of maybe he

306
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:44,720
invented it he just he composed it but it involved

307
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:51,599
the decay of society when the rulers do not care for everyone equally

308
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:58,160
and this is such an important idea that everyone should be get treated equally everyone should be given

309
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:05,119
the same opportunities and it's the role of the government to make sure that happens

310
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:13,200
and the way that this myth goes is that there were a whole series of kings

311
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,960
hereditary kings who were born and ruled for many years and

312
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:25,520
and the custom was they would always go when they first became king and get advice from

313
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:31,440
wise people from wise religious people and others

314
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:37,119
and their and the teachings that they received was was to live

315
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:43,680
to live by the dharma and and one of the ways that the dharma means outside of buddhism which is the

316
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,720
meaning here it means just justice to live

317
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:55,839
or to live to to rule justly to rule fairly which i interpret to mean

318
00:58:55,839 --> 00:59:02,079
um treating everyone equally giving everyone equal opportunities

319
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:07,440
which uh is still not the case in this country

320
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:15,880
and uh the passage goes like this

321
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:31,359
so these wise people will tell the king yourself depending on the dhamma

322
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:36,640
honoring it revering it cherishing it and doing homage to it and venerating it

323
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:42,720
have dhamma as your badge and banner acknowledging the dhamma as your master

324
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:48,240
you should establish guard award and protect

325
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:56,640
everyone your household your troops your people

326
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:04,640
everyone's on long list including animals and birds the first task of uh the rulers is to

327
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:10,079
protect everyone but this thing about the dhamma dharma

328
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:15,599
is uh it's not this doesn't this in this context doesn't mean buddhism

329
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:21,599
but it means kind of a natural law it means justice it means fear affairs in the fairness

330
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:27,280
um it's uh uh and so they

331
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:33,680
the king is supposed to rule based on dhamma not on their own wishes their own

332
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:40,240
desires you'll see this becomes important later uh let no

333
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:46,480
uh non-dharma prevail in your kingdom non-dharma means

334
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:54,880
injustice here in all the different ways that can mean let no injustice prevail in your kingdom

335
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:00,799
and to those who have nothing provide them

336
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:07,520
for those who don't have anything provide provide for them provide for them property probably so

337
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:13,680
that they can take care of themselves and whatever religious people there are

338
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:18,799
in your kingdom who have renounced the life of sensual

339
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:24,079
infatuation and are devoted to forbearance and

340
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:30,960
gentleness each one taming themselves

341
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:37,599
each one calming themselves and each one striving to the end of craving

342
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:42,640
if from time to time they should come to you and consult you as to

343
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:48,640
at the time they should come to you and consult you as to what is wholesome and what is

344
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:53,920
unwholesome in other words take advice from some of

345
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:59,680
the people who do a lot of practice and have a whole different set of values uh

346
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:05,960
don't consult with the people who manufacture assault rifles

347
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,760
consult with the dalai lama

348
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:19,440
and uh and and who can teach you those things

349
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,559
that will will in the long run uh

350
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:29,839
lead to welfare and happiness not to harm and sorrow you should listen

351
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:35,440
to them so this is the advice that king got and so for many generations that's what they

352
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,799
did until one king kind of forgot to do that forgot to

353
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:46,640
consult with when he first became king but finally the ministers came and got

354
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:51,920
him and said you have to listen to this so he heard this this advice

355
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:57,280
and so he did set up to guard and protect others

356
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,960
however he did not care for the people who are in need

357
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:09,119
the people who had no property and to hit the way of taking care of themselves he didn't provide them with property so

358
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:15,760
they could and uh and as a result

359
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:23,119
became rife with the spread of poverty a person took what was not given thus

360
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:30,480
committing what was called theft the king arrested them the person

361
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:37,599
and after a little short trial the person admitted to having stolen

362
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:44,000
the king gave him some property here take care of yourself and your

363
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,680
family this way but the other people who are poor

364
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:57,680
but wow that's all i have to do is steal and then i'll get so there's stealing began

365
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:03,520
and that and the king very quickly said wait a minute this doesn't work the people keep

366
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:08,480
stealing so instead he um he killed them

367
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:14,559
and punished them and with punishment like that then

368
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:20,000
the people took up weapons themselves

369
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:26,559
and with weapons themselves they started killing each other and other people and so violence spread through the realm and

370
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:32,640
things society deteriorated dramatically so this is a kind of a mythic story of

371
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:39,440
origin but the origin here the mythic story begins the decay of society

372
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:46,079
begins when those who are ruling

373
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:51,440
are not treating everyone equally not giving everyone equal opportunity through property and

374
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:57,119
something to to live and have a successful life and so people become

375
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:03,200
poor and of course when they're starving they steal and when they steal then i said of

376
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:09,119
course that you it sounds like it began with a good idea to give them something

377
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:14,880
but it was already too late it set up a very strange dynamic where

378
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:22,400
people other people started not to steal and then violence and all that

379
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:30,078
so this spiral of violence violence begets violence as martha the king said

380
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:39,200
non-violence does it beget non-violence not harming does it get non-harming

381
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:45,680
i'm sure you could find ex situations where that's not the case

382
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:52,799
i'm sure you can find examples of where violence does not not beget violence

383
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:59,440
but the tendency is that non-violence begets non-violence

384
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:05,839
that non-violence comes from this deeper place inside can come from this deeper place inside not from

385
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:13,200
fear and non-violence out of fear doesn't really work either but can we find a place within

386
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:19,000
can we clarify our hearts enough

387
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:26,319
so that we're in touch with something that's an inner wealth

388
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:32,559
an inner place of peace and satisfaction and inspiration

389
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:37,760
when we feel we've resolved our wounds resolved our

390
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:44,400
conflicts resolved our our fears and despairs

391
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:51,839
it's possible to resolve them it's possible to settle we should not succumb to the belief

392
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:58,000
that how we see the world through fear how we see the world through despair and anger

393
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:04,079
how we see the world through greed or hatred

394
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:10,160
gives us an accurate view of what the world is like it doesn't

395
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:16,400
so if we think that it's accurate then we will

396
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:23,839
only perpetuate that very view it supports that view

397
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:29,920
strengthens it but it's not accurate the view of the world

398
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:35,599
through love and compassion is that a more accurate view

399
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:41,119
it doesn't have to be that has its own problems sometimes

400
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:46,960
especially if it's enforced like a surface thing like i'm supposed to do this

401
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:54,480
where i think really makes a huge difference is doing something like meditation

402
01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:00,400
that allows all the shoulds and all the kind of even like a lot of the

403
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:06,319
structures of our thinking to get quiet and peaceful

404
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:13,280
to resolve the challenges of our hearts to get quiet in the heart or peaceful in

405
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:20,000
the heart so that when we when we encounter the world

406
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:26,719
we're encountering it from this place inside where something resonates something different can happen

407
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:32,798
i don't know what i don't know all the different ways we'll respond from the heart

408
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:38,159
but it'll be much healthier than responding from the surface the

409
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:45,679
reactive way and so this this to be inspired

410
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:52,640
by the horrendous things that go on in our society to change society to find ways to

411
01:08:52,640 --> 01:09:01,040
promote non-harming in our society is one of the great tasks of a life

412
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:08,718
but before we could do that i think to really do the work in ourselves

413
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:14,238
to find a way to be an exemplar

414
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:20,960
of a life that's motivated by non-fear by non-hatred

415
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:27,520
by non-despair and non-greed

416
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:35,838
so that the most the most the most wondrous qualities of our heart

417
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:41,120
have a chance to be shared in the world that we live in

418
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:48,278
it's heartbreaking to have

419
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:54,719
all this hatred and despair and anger and violence that goes on in this

420
01:09:54,719 --> 01:10:02,159
country but in that heartbreak don't despair

421
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:08,080
use it as as a powerful catalyst encouragement

422
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:15,600
to do your work to do your practice to resolve the issues of your heart

423
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:22,800
so that your heart can come forth in beautiful response

424
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:29,679
to what this world needs and a response that's clearly and obviously one

425
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:38,640
that never will harm anyone let's live in a world where non-harming

426
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:44,560
is understood to be one of the greatest gifts we can we can

427
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:51,120
give so thank you

428
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:57,679

429
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:04,080
