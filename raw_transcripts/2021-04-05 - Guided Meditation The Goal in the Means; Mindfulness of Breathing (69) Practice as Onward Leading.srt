1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:19,359
so warm greetings from greetings for the

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,000
this meditation session our time together and for the beginning of this week

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,719
and as we begin get ready for this meditation

4
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,000
i would like to offer a wonderful principle

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,559
of practice and that is that the dharma practice unfolds

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:56,000
most harmoniously when the means of practice

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,440
contains some of the goal so that the means are not dramatically

8
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,960
different than the goal but that the goal is found in the means itself

9
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:17,119
in the practice even for someone who is practicing for the first time today that it isn't that there's a goal

10
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:24,159
far in the distance that we can attain so much as i mean there is but that

11
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,320
we can discover uh some of those qualities even in the first time we sit down to

12
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:38,400
meditate and it's many qualities of awakening

13
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:46,799
but one of the qualities of awakening is awakening itself the simplicity of being aware

14
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,040
of what's happening and simply being aware being aware without an agenda without

15
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,079
trying to go for a goal and attain something

16
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,799
a quality of awakening is an absence of greed

17
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,920
an absence of insistence and ideas of should i have to do this i should do this it

18
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:19,680
should be this way i want to attain this i want to do there's a kind of it could be a drive

19
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,640
to want and awakening also has an absence of resistance

20
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:34,480
an absence of being in contention with reality sit and meditate

21
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:42,080
free of contention and so here we are

22
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:49,519
and to be aware with the generosity of allowing each

23
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:57,040
thing that arises each experience we have to allow it to be as it is

24
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,840
liberation the goal of practice maybe is understood less as you become

25
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,159
liberated as it is everything becomes liberated from you

26
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:18,800
everything is becomes free of your needs your expectations your projections your ideas your

27
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,120
your associations and that's particularly valuable when

28
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:33,280
it's really being having an intimacy and a connection to what's happening here with ourselves

29
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,720
to really be intimate and here and connected and deeply respectful enough

30
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:49,360
to allow each thing its freedom so to begin this process to

31
00:03:49,360 --> 00:04:01,840
take a to enter into

32
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:15,840
to enter into our posture

33
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:29,840
and to gently close your eyes

34
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,919
too gently

35
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,840
now enter into your posture and make small adjustments

36
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,759
both to feel more comfortable in your posture and maybe more alert

37
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:01,680
but also to awaken in your body to bring a sense of

38
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:11,840
attention alive in your body itself

39
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:38,080
and take a few long slow deep breaths

40
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:46,479
these long slow deep breaths at the beginning can be a ritual reminder that awakening happens

41
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,680
here and now that awakening is some aspect of being

42
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,199
fully present here

43
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
now

44
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,840
and as you exhale to settle into now and here

45
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:30,240
curious interested in this awakening and freedom

46
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,840
that can only be found here and now

47
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:49,840
and letting your breath letting your breathing return to normal

48
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:17,520
relaxing your belly

49
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,960
relaxing your chest

50
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,840
relaxing your face

51
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,479
awakening the goal of practice has a quality an aspect of deep

52
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,879
relaxation or an absence of tension

53
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:06,240
contraction and to relax at the beginning of meditation

54
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,960
is not an elementary beginning practice

55
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,080
to begin the process of being attuned and in harmony

56
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:27,840
with awakening itself

57
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,720
and then to settle into the body breathing

58
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:22,080
what is it what would it be like for you to have an intimacy with your breathing

59
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,080
with the body's experience of breathing

60
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:37,040
where that intimacy and attention shared qualities of freedom

61
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,320
liberation freedom from shoulds

62
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:53,279
freedoms from resistance to anything

63
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:05,839
freedom from contention and struggles with how things are

64
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:19,839
freedom for need from things freedom from needing things to be different at this moment

65
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:34,240
an awareness that grants each experience its freedom

66
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:42,880
freedom from us and our ideas and desires each particular thing that occurs in the

67
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:50,399
present moment in our body and our mind and our hearts

68
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,279
allowing it to be without being

69
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,240
involved in it entangled

70
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,640
just letting it be here

71
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,839
in its own simplicity

72
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,720
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

73
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:06,320
to see if you bring into your mind the people of

74
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:13,120
your life the ones you know of the ones you imagine in the world

75
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:23,919
the peoples of your community and if you imagine meeting them

76
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:32,880
with an awakened mind or awakened heart one in which there's no fear

77
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:41,039
no contention no opposition no hostility no

78
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:48,799
defensiveness no greed being settled and content and happy in

79
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:56,159
your own heart and to open your heart to

80
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,200
meet and be aware of people around you

81
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,880
and what would it be like if there are qualities of liberation or freedom

82
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,679
awakening in how you meet others

83
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:25,520
how you encounter them an encounter that's free of

84
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:35,679
clinging need resistance just present

85
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,760
but not in danger of succumbing to the demands of others

86
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,039
not in the danger of

87
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:57,200
getting entangled in those relationships because you're at home and resting in

88
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,158
your own awareness

89
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:12,640
and perhaps then in the safety of an awakened heart

90
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,360
to offer your good will to others

91
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,360
your sense of care and generosity

92
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,840
may it be that people i know could be happy

93
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,039
may it be that they could be safe

94
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:46,399
may it be that they can be peaceful and free

95
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:56,799
may it be that they can feel deeply safe and at ease and happy in themselves

96
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:10,000
and may it be that from whatever awakening or inner freedom

97
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,200
we have that we live our life for the welfare

98
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,840
and benefit of others

99
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,240
may we ourselves and all beings

100
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:47,840
share in happiness safety peace and freedom

101
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:03,200
so in these almost 70 sessions we've gone through

102
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,360
the 16 steps of mindfulness of breathing

103
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:17,600
and the most famous discourse where i have where these

104
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,279
16 steps occur is actually in a discourse that has much more in it

105
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:29,679
and it has a second half where the practice is discussed as how it

106
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,919
follows up how it continues after being well established in 16 steps

107
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:43,360
or it continues and describes part of the wider kind of unfolding

108
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:50,559
that happens while we're doing the 16 steps and somehow the second half presents

109
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,600
more richness and fullness to it and partly it does so

110
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,559
by harmonizing bringing together and showing how other aspects of early buddhist

111
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:08,720
practice come into play in doing mindfulness or breathing

112
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:15,200
and in particular there's two and that is the four foundations of mindfulness how they how

113
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:22,638
the four foundations of mindfulness are fulfilled through this breathing meditation and how it leads to

114
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:30,720
the seven factors of awakening and um inherent in this discussion

115
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,398
that's a here's you know this second half of the instructions or this description of

116
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,919
practice is uh is something that's called the

117
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:47,839
onward leading nature of the dharma there's a very famous description of the

118
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:53,919
dharma where it says that it's uh immediate

119
00:34:53,919 --> 00:35:02,640
inviting inspection onward leading to be known for oneself and um

120
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:11,040
but this onward leading uh the word for onward leading could also imply kind of like it carries it carries

121
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,880
us along so uh it isn't so much that we're the agent

122
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:24,079
of developing and growing in the practice as as we enter the dharma stream

123
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:31,839
we enter the stream of meditation and somehow the meditation the dharma carries us along

124
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:39,920
and a kind of very simple way of understanding that this in one aspect is that most people

125
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:47,040
spend their days preoccupied maybe with tension and attachment wanting and the mind racing and spinning

126
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:53,760
and afraid or or angry resentful all kinds of ways in

127
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,720
which we're caught in phenomena and activities and and so there's a lot of tension

128
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:08,800
physical tension emotional tension mental tension and if we begin to relax

129
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:16,960
that all that preoccupation all that entanglement with everything then um it isn't just that we

130
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,320
then nothing happens but there starts to being an unwinding a dissolving

131
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:29,040
of fading away of attachment and that fading away that's a dissolving

132
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,400
of attachment begins to change there's an onward movement onward moving

133
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,880
phenomenon and that as we change things open up within us that qualities

134
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:48,760
and capacities we have that were submerged or repressed by our fears our attachments our

135
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:54,320
preoccupations our entanglements have a chance to begin showing

136
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:00,320
themselves and they become stronger and stronger and um it isn't so much that we're trying to

137
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:09,680
make them become stronger but they begin unfolding and moving and uh and we it's wonderful to feel

138
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,040
in meditation slowly day by day or whatever way we might feel it that

139
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:21,200
there's a kind of an opening um a kind of um releasing a growing and

140
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,320
maturing of something quite beautiful inside that

141
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,839
is kind of like a plant that has finally come into the sun sunlight it's been in

142
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:37,280
the dark for a long long time and the plant grows and it just flowers

143
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:44,480
and this natural uh kind of that description of a flower coming to full blossom

144
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,560
is part of it is inherent is inherent in the in the teachings of

145
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:58,720
the buddha where there's kind of over and over again a reference to an organic movement growth unfolding

146
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,119
flowing of phenomena as we enter into this dharma path

147
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:11,200
the one of them is in fact the growth of a fl of a plant we can cultivate the plant but we don't

148
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:17,200
tug on it to make it grow uh a frequent frequent metaphor is that

149
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:24,960
of a of a river or stream coming down from a mountain if it rains in the mountaintop the rain

150
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,720
rains enough then the rain the raindrops start to flow down the side of the mountain

151
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,960
they join together and form little streamlets and streamlets become streams the streams become rivers the rivers

152
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,480
become you know bigger and bigger until finally they come down to the plains

153
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:49,280
and become wide big silent rivers just flowing along into the ocean and

154
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:55,920
that water has its natural flow and flow of gravity and that metaphor is used for the for

155
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,760
getting into the stream the flow of the dharma it will carry us along and as we kind of

156
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,920
go into the dharma these qualities become bigger and bigger something inside of us becomes bigger and stronger

157
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:15,599
and also much more silent and the metaphor of silence is the silence that happens within when

158
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:21,760
there's no conceit when we're not no longer caught up and preoccupied with me myself

159
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,880
and mine it isn't doesn't mean that we're physically silent but it means that there's a silencing of

160
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,079
this kind of extra agitation that uh spills over into the world in

161
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:42,480
all kinds of noisy ways and so this flow down the river uh

162
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,640
that uh entering the stream is one of the metaphors that uh with the first experience of

163
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:55,440
real liberation real freedom a person has changed forever because now they know what the stream is they know

164
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,960
where the current is they know the both directions and how to be in that current

165
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:09,599
that's going to carry us onward to full liberation and so um the onward leading nature

166
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:16,160
of the dharma in the anapan assad and there's one way that concentration

167
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,200
practices onward leading and another way that

168
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:28,400
insight practice is onward leading and the two go together and the concentration practice is

169
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,800
armored leading is described as the there's the arising of gladness

170
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:41,040
when we're no longer caught up in the hindrances no longer the mind is no longer

171
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,480
distracted all the time and the glad that we're finally present

172
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:53,920
that gladness is the condition out of which flows

173
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,520
joy and if we really feel that joy it's a condition that out of which flows

174
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:07,040
a deeper tranquility relaxing a calming

175
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:13,599
and with that deeper calming there is happiness and with happiness there arises

176
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,040
concentration and the way that this these five gladness joy

177
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,880
tranquility happiness and concentration are talked about in the suit dozen in buddha's teaching

178
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:32,240
they are not something that the meditator is doing and making happen directly but rather

179
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:39,359
we're creating the conditions where this onward leading movement through gladness joy tranquility

180
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:46,000
happiness and concentration can unfold on its own and

181
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,240
and and then that's the concentration path the inside path as described best i

182
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:59,200
think by the last four steps of the mindfulness of breathing that there is

183
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,720
um insight observation observing

184
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,880
inconstancy there's a fading away of attachments that depend on things

185
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,319
having more constancy there's the ending cessation of

186
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:22,160
certain attachments and then there's the letting go the relinquishing

187
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:28,560
of you know of our investment belief in those attachments

188
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:34,480
and so this that also is described more of a natural flow it's not something we do but something

189
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,400
we're observing and watching happen and so in anapanasati the

190
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,880
the flow of practice moves through concentration and then

191
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,400
leads this insight of deep observing observing and the but the

192
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,720
what the meditator does all along mostly is just staying with the breath being with the

193
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,240
breath and there's a little intentionality to just stay focused stay focused in the

194
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,520
breath which is expressed in the repeated way

195
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,920
in which the grammar of a for the phrase is uh having to do with being mindful of

196
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:22,560
breathing occurs it says one trains

197
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:32,000
two says and then there's a quotation like this is what i'm doing and saying to myself i will breathe in

198
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:39,200
when trains i will breathe out one will engage over and over again no

199
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,040
matter what happens as we go through all these 16 stages we're not getting sidetracked by anything

200
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:51,520
we're allowing all the other things to happen in the onward leading nature and we're recognizing allowing the the

201
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:59,040
tranquility the relaxation the joy the happiness the gladness the concentration the

202
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:05,920
liberations the observations that happen but each all along the dedication is

203
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,520
simplicity of just staying with a breath i will breathe in i will breathe out

204
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:17,200
i will stay connected to it this is where the home is for people doing mindfulness or

205
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,520
breathing it's not exclusive the attention is open and aware

206
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:30,560
so that this wider field gets allowed to manifest and to grow the dharma that's

207
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,839
onward leading can appear but to keep us relaxed and not caught in

208
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:41,200
anything not preoccupied we keep staying with the breath in a relaxed

209
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:47,119
open committed way not clinging to it but just kind of staying open but

210
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,319
staying there so we don't get drift off and get caught in other things

211
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:59,760
and if we have this relaxed open uh steady continuous dedication

212
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:06,400
love for devotion for just breathing one breath at a time and of course we'll get

213
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,599
distracted but just whenever we can to come back i will stay here with the breathing

214
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:19,520
this is what i'm doing then this we start entering into the dharma which is onward leading the

215
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,599
flow that begins to unfold and uh and one of the things that it

216
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:31,119
unfolds into this is uh uh the

217
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:36,400
the uh the core aspect of the four foundations of mindfulness

218
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:43,838
and um and how this mindfulness of breathing connects with four foundations will be the topic for tomorrow

219
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:52,400
so uh thank you so much and um and i hope that

220
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,520
you will be open to

221
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,720
not being the agent of change not to be the one in charge of making things

222
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:11,760
happen and fixing things all the time but you go through the day with some room to allow things to unfold

223
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,280
to allow yourself to unfold to make room for yourself and room for

224
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:24,400
the dharma that you can't do if you're just constantly caught up in being in charge or being the agent or

225
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:33,599
being the subject of your preoccupations so thank you
