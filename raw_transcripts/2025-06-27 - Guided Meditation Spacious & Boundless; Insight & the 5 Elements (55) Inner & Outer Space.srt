1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,320
so everyone welcome as we start to settle in

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,000
to our morning afternoon evening meditation together

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,240
the invitation is to consider in your heart or if it feels right to share

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,720
aloud or in writing what if anything you noticed about

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,640
motion conveyance air movement

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,840
in your practice the winds of change in your practice

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:51,600
and as you consider that beginning to settle into

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:01,000
whatever posture expresses supports your meditation practice best this morning

9
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,960
taking a moment perhaps to look around your room or your space

10
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,920
and especially noticing the spaces between or around objects

11
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:31,119
between you and the screen or between you and whatever is in front of you

12
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:40,439
noticing what artists call negative space the space around the space between

13
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,680
and then perhaps taking a couple of longer more intentional breaths

14
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,680
allowing your attention to go inside

15
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:07,280
and notice how you perceive the space around you

16
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,000
with your eyes closed

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,760
noticing sound and silence

18
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,760
perhaps an intuitive sense of the largeness or smallness

19
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,560
of whatever kind of environment you're in in this moment

20
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,120
then allowing the breathing to be natural

21
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,640
however it is today

22
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,440
noticing breath

23
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:19,480
moving in to your body through the space of your nostrils or mouth

24
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:31,519
that sense of expansion or rising this breath enters in the lungs

25
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,680
the diaphragm moves the abdomen moves

26
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,920
perhaps allowing the shoulders to roll move up and down a couple of times

27
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,920
to allow more relaxation in your core

28
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,280
inviting the eyes to soften in their sockets

29
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,479
the tongue to relax in your mouth

30
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,680
perhaps noticing if there's a way of holding your head that allows just a

31
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,880
little bit more space between the vertebrae in the back of the neck a

32
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,520
little bit more relaxation

33
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,160
allowing the heart the mind the attention to attune to this moment

34
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,720
the warmth and cool on your skin

35
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:36,199
the weight of this body held to the Earth

36
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,280
no sense of moisture or dryness in your mouth or nose

37
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:08,039
the tuning to any sense of spaciousness within

38
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,160
perhaps that little pause between breaths

39
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,280
or a feeling of softening in

40
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,080
softening and releasing into this moment

41
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:31,280
allowing any mental or emotional activity just to be there in the periphery

42
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,560
and noticing these sense

43
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,880
of healthy distance space from any thoughts

44
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:50,319
emotions space between

45
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:57,400
any mental activity and resting

46
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,800
allowing Present moment experience to flow through

47
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,800
unimpeded

48
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,200
inviting more ease relaxation

49
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,919
into this moment

50
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,440
allowing the body to soften

51
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,039
into the surroundings

52
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,240
and if it feels right sensing into

53
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,799
perhaps imagining

54
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:52,400
the vast sky above you wherever you are

55
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,000
far above or just above

56
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,480
sense of wide open space

57
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:31,799
letting the heart relax into that wide open space

58
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,159
the mind the body to open to it

59
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:03,080
and allowing wishes of goodwill friendliness meta

60
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,919
to flow out born on into

61
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:21,320
this open space flowing out boundlessly

62
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,799
wishing that others be safe

63
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:51,400
happy healthy

64
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,400
that they be peaceful at ease and free

65
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:10,600
in whatever words or wordless reverberations

66
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,799
like sunlight through unimpeded space

67
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,360
go outwards all directions

68
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:32,760
towards whomever or whatever occupies

69
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,360
that open space within and around your heart

70
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,240
and as this meditation draws to a close

71
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:53,760
considering how our practice here together your

72
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,120
practice might be of benefit in your own mind and

73
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:08,360
heart and life and how that benefit might radiate out

74
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:16,400
to benefit all of the lives we touch and all of the lives they touch

75
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,840
outwards and outwards

76
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,000
may all beings be safe peaceful

77
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and free and may our practice here together be a cause and condition for greater

78
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,520
love liberation and peace in the world

79
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:54,190
[Music]

80
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,069
[Music]

81
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,240
thank you for your practice

82
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:34,399
so friends we have reached the fifth of five days exploring the

83
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:40,480
five elements which is a contemplation and meditation practice

84
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,960
in the ancient teachings of the Buddha a practice that can support insight

85
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,520
reveal insight

86
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,840
so today well this week we've covered earth water

87
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:05,480
fire air or wind and today we're covering space

88
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,840
so the space element

89
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,919
um is the topic and the translation element for the word datu really kind of

90
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,840
completely breaks down here a better translation could be quality or even

91
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:31,600
potential or potentiality in our direct experience

92
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,120
space around and in our bodies can be quite

93
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,799
evident the space around or between objects

94
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:52,399
the space out up in the sky especially the night sky and the space within our bodies our

95
00:30:52,399 --> 00:31:02,880
ears mouth nostrils other orififices the space within the diaphragm or lungs

96
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,159
but often in the ancient tradition especially in the commentaries space is

97
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:14,000
considered to be more of a mental quality or shifts in perception

98
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,159
so what do I mean by this well here's a couple of the ways quality of

99
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,279
space might show up in the experience of meditation

100
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:32,480
externally many people find it easy to tune into the space of vastness or

101
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,840
closeness even with their eyes closed through noticing the quality of sound

102
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,000
sound and silence or verberation can make it very clear whether we're in

103
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:52,000
a smaller space kind of cozy or in a vast cathedral or out in the open

104
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,080
outside even with the eyes closed there can be a sense of the amount of light and where

105
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,360
the light is coming from that might give the sense of a sky

106
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:13,440
and then sometimes when we're fortunate there's an inward sense of spaciousness

107
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:20,240
in the heart in our perceptions and even in our bodies remember some people after

108
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,080
a retreat feel like they've lost weight within their bodies like it lost a

109
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:33,360
density or contraction and there's more of a sense of spaciousness almost like it's between yourselves

110
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:41,200
or at other times there might be a sense of density contraction

111
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:48,559
and while these are all perceptual qualities it's echo echoes physics right

112
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:55,840
we are on a quantum level mostly space our atoms are 99.999%

113
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:04,278
empty without space we'd be really tiny and very very heavy

114
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,919
i find it fascinating that in a simile back in the Buddha's time the bronze age

115
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:16,000
ancient India the Buddha conveys a similar notion

116
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,039
he uses the simile of the form of this body being like a lump of foam

117
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:29,039
like a lump of foam there's an emptiness there and more practically another

118
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:36,399
simile used and I'm quoting here friends just as when a space is enclosed

119
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:44,880
by timber and creepers grass and clay it comes to be termed just house

120
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:51,039
so too when a space is enclosed by bones and senue flesh and skin

121
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:57,240
it comes to be termed just body

122
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,080
so that simile reveals an ancientness of the construction of homes in ancient

123
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:10,960
India the um simplicity of it it also both of these simileies allude to the

124
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,200
insight of a nata not self the emptiness

125
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:24,560
that can be directly perceived through insight that is within

126
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,599
linking internal and external perceptions of space can be awe

127
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:38,240
inspiring and very practical and helpful in settling the mind

128
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:45,520
simply looking out at the night sky the space around the stars the space between

129
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,358
the stars the space around the moon if you're out in the country especially

130
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:57,118
where you can see clearly there's this vastness

131
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,480
wow a sense of healthy humility and

132
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,400
smallness in the larger vastness of things

133
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,480
and then on a practical level the space around

134
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:21,599
and the space between things whether they be the palm trees I'm looking at outside my window right

135
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:31,359
now or buildings or plants that begins to attune and settle the

136
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:37,040
mind and nervous system if we do it for at least a while this works inside a

137
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:44,000
room by simply looking at the empty spaces where the corners are or the space between furniture

138
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,359
and a solid minute or two or three of that actually

139
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:56,240
settles the nervous system it settles reactivity and if you do it right before meditation

140
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,599
it can help our minds attend to the space between

141
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:08,640
thoughts the space within can try it right now

142
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,079
closing your eyes and feeling into

143
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:20,480
the space that weaves through interpenetrates

144
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,800
your body

145
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:36,800
so for some on retreat in certain states the perception of this

146
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:43,599
internal space becomes vast even infinite

147
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,960
this is a base of perception which is related to the jas that Gil talked about

148
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:55,680
earlier this year the immaterial jas they're sometimes called

149
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,760
and that can be a powerful experience not necessary for awakening or insight

150
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:09,359
and powerful nonetheless the Buddha advised his son Rahula to

151
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:15,920
make his meditation like each of the elements including like space

152
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,520
he asks says "Son if you make your meditation

153
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,880
like space agreeable and disagreeable contacts

154
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,560
contacts meaning any sensory data any sensory contact

155
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,760
will not invade your mind and heart and remain

156
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,960
because nothing sticks to space right

157
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,480
the Buddha also in a more daily life context which is still quite relevant

158
00:37:52,480 --> 00:38:00,400
today teaches practitioners to imagine space if they're hearing harsh divisive

159
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,640
unpleasant or even hostile speech

160
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,079
the technique he offers is to imagine those words landing in space that they

161
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,920
need to have no impact no impact

162
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,920
and as part of the same teaching the Buddha then asks practitioners to

163
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,440
imagine space boundless vast space as a

164
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,200
way of cultivating boundless meta goodwill friendliness

165
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:43,359
this is even um echoed in the very common chant about meta and the other

166
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:50,640
immeasurables Brahma Biharas where the chant is something like

167
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:57,599
outwards and unbounded freed from hatred and hostility with

168
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:05,359
goodwill with friendliness with kindness outwards and unbounded

169
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:12,240
There's an unbinding that happens in internal reactivity

170
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,720
when the heart begins to open to meta when the heart begins to

171
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:26,079
open to spaciousness even without any conscious kindness being cultivated

172
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:32,000
kindness tends to be a more natural response when we're

173
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,880
spacious you've probably noticed

174
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,920
so space as element space as quality

175
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,079
space as inspiration space as a perceptual

176
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:59,440
way of relating to your body your meditation your heart and mind

177
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:06,480
it's the fifth of the five qualities five elements we've explored this week and to recap

178
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:13,040
we've explored the potentialities the qualities from kind of an inspiration point of

179
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,640
view as well as a more direct experience in meditation

180
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,920
of earth heaviness or lightness

181
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,960
hardness or softness smoothness or roughness of water

182
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:39,359
fluidity wetness or dryness the sense of motion

183
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:47,680
sense of capacity of motion malleability fire warmth and cool

184
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,119
the warmth of compassion the heat of determination the coolness

185
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,640
of equinimity and air

186
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:06,079
even more related to motion where breath becomes air internal and

187
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:13,599
external all of these qualities teach us our inseparability from nature

188
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,640
our fundamental belonging with everything

189
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:25,680
attuning to these can support insight into inconstancy ana

190
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:33,839
they can ground the meditation in broader and deeper connection with felt experience and cultivate more

191
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:40,280
malleability of mind fluidity of perceptions

192
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,440
these contemplations can support letting go of a flare of reactivity

193
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:55,119
and support a healthy warmth or coolness of the heart depending on the situation

194
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:01,680
it can open us to mindfulness of motion and

195
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:09,440
more ways of skillfully navigating more balanced to navigate the dooka

196
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:16,319
of life's storms and the eight worldly winds and finally

197
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:24,079
these practices can reveal inner spaciousness they can support an absence of fixated

198
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:33,720
self- concern and that's an absence into which an abundance of presence can flow

199
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:44,279
i'll close with another poem by Rosemary Watah Traor

200
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,839
it's entitled it's like this

201
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:00,720
it's like this the sun itself is constantly moving through space

202
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,880
wherever and whatever that is yet it never leaves us

203
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,160
add this to the list of marbles like how a glass of water was once a

204
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:18,720
cloud like how love can grow in us despite despair

205
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:25,359
despite fear given such gifts one must wonder how it

206
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:33,599
is our arms aren't constantly raised in spontaneous praise for life

207
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:39,359
i know and you know why sometimes our hands stay down

208
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:46,640
but now standing still together even as we're spinning and racing through space

209
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,960
even if it's only a whisper when faced with the truth that great forces hold

210
00:43:52,960 --> 00:44:00,000
our lives in place it feels right to say "Thank you

211
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,280
thank you." Eyes lifting heart trembling

212
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:14,440
the improbable earth so solid beneath our feet

213
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:24,599
so thank you for your kind attention and thank you for your practice

214
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:34,160
i have two short announcements one is that if you would like to deepen

215
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:40,319
your practice and spend more time with myself or with other wonderful teachers

216
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:46,160

218
