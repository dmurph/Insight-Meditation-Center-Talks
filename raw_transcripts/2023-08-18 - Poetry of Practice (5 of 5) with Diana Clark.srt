1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:09,320
it's been such a pleasure to practice with you all this week and today is day five of five and we're

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,200
continuing on this theme The Poetry of

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,400
practice and there's a way in which poetry can highlight or emphasize or

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:29,560
maybe even like shine a light on maybe some of those dark and hidden crevices

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,480
of our hearts and Minds those parts that we don't necessarily look at maybe we're

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,039
not even intending to not look at them for they just for whatever reason don't

7
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:49,920
get seen and this is part of uh the power of poetry is that they help us to see them

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,160
and maybe even bring some light-heartedness or bring some new perspective or maybe even some

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,559
spaciousness like oh yeah I had seen that and with that recognition of

10
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:09,520
something new there can be some Delight or some openness or like wow okay I

11
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:18,880
hadn't seen that before so that's part of the power of poetry is to help us see what hasn't

12
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:27,360
been seen But coupled with this sense of recognition like oh yeah that is there I

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,840
just was not paying attention to it before

14
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:42,880
more so as I've been doing in the preceding days as part of this series I'll drop in a poem during the guided

15
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:51,680
meditation but let's start with a guided meditation so taking a meditation

16
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:03,920
posture maybe starting by taking a few few long slow deep

17
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:11,039
breaths as a way to connect to the breath to the body to

18
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,280
this

19
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:30,720
moment there's a way in which the physiology of the body responds to

20
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,800
deeper breaths particularly longer

21
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:44,000
exhales activates the nervous system in a way that promotes

22
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,319
relaxation so just a few longer breaths to

23
00:02:53,319 --> 00:03:01,840
support relaxation or some letting go of [Music] tension but also so to support our

24
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,920
connection to the bodily

25
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,959
experience tuning into the experience of

26
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,920
sitting in this posture whatever posture you're

27
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,519
in what is it like to be in this posture

28
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,040
today at this

29
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
moment

30
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,199
maybe doing a light General body skin and noticing if there are areas of

31
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:43,759
tightness or tension or places where there might be some more

32
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,080
opening softness ease

33
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,600
available not because we have to get rid of any tension or

34
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,960
tightness just because this recognition that openness and

35
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,039
ease is the direction that our practice

36
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,080
goes and part of how we go that [Music]

37
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,440
direction is being sensitive tuned into what's

38
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,800
happening with an attitude of

39
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:36,240
allowing as best we can as best we

40
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
can

41
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:24,000
sometimes tension is very subtle around the eyes or the jaw

42
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
mouth

43
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,240
sometimes the shoulders are raised up just a little

44
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
bit

45
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,039
tuning into the sensations of

46
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,100
breathing and a relaxed warm

47
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:38,919
[Music] manner with some care

48
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:43,599
respect for this body that's

49
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
breathing

50
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:35,159
is it possible to set the direction the

51
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:44,519
attitude of this meditation session as one of care and

52
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,040
warmth

53
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
openness

54
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,399
part of the way this warmth and

55
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:03,720
Care can can be expressed is when we notice that the

56
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,399
mind is no longer on the sensations of

57
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:18,519
breathing can there be an attitude of oh look at

58
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:25,399
that okay let's just begin again with the sensations of

59
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
breathing

60
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,720
I'm going to drop in a

61
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:56,199
poem you don't need to do anything with this

62
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:03,639
poem just allow it to enter into the

63
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:12,360
space you don't have to figure it out you don't have to have a

64
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,360
commentary I'll talk a little bit more about it after the guided

65
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
meditation

66
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,440

[Music]

85
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,440
[Music]

86
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
all

87
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,600
so hello again welcome welcome

88
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:02,200
everybody and the short little few words that I

89
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,880
said before the beginning of the guided meditation I mentioned that poetry

90
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,080
sometimes helps us to see things in a little bit different way or maybe to see

91
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,279
things that we wouldn't otherwise see poking into the crevices of our hearts

92
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:27,600
and minds and Shining a light and hopefully in a way that maybe has a sense of recognition like oh yeah I had

93
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:35,320
noticed that so that's a little bit about what this poem is like maybe I'll read the

94
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:43,000
poem or maybe I'll make a few comments before I read the poem so I would say just in general like

95
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,960
this really broad brush about practice Buddhist practice this has a few

96
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,919
movements you might say uh directionality towards greater

97
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:02,519
understanding of both ourself and others but as well as this movement towards

98
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:09,000
greater ease and well-being and this movement towards the

99
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,120
diminishment and elimination of suffering so these all these are

100
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:21,200
happening together this uh with practice and make another really big uh

101
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,320
generalization I would say that there's these two primary types of practices

102
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:35,919
like subsets of practicing and one is this cultivation developing building

103
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,679
strengthening and the other is Letting Go it's releasing shedding

104
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:49,120
renouncing so we have both of these types of practices that help support these three

105
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:56,159
different movements this movement towards greater understanding greater ease and less

106
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,279
suffering so this poem I think that uh helps us

107
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:10,000
maybe with uh all of this there's a way in which and I'll talk a little bit more about this but it helps with this uh

108
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,720
cultivation and with letting go so the

109
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:27,279
poem is by Lem CE the last name is spelled s i SS a y it's called something

110
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:36,080
I like by LM CE I like Rex I like X junkies I like

111
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:43,960
flunks and ex flunkies I like the way the career lless career I like flat beer

112
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:49,039
I like people who tell half stories and forget the rest I like people who make

113
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:55,799
Doodles in important written tests I like being late I like fate I like the

114
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:01,720
way teeth grade I like laceless shoes cordless Blues I

115
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:08,399
like the one bar Blues I like buttonless coats and leaky boats I like rubbish

116
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:15,960
tips and bitten lips I like yesterday's toast I like a cold tea I like

117
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,880
reality I like ashtrays I write and like crap

118
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,799
plays I like curtains that don't quite shut I like bread knives that don't

119
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:34,360
quite cut I like rips and blue jeans I like people who can't say what they mean

120
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:41,360
I like spiders with no legs pencils with no lead ants with no heads worms that

121
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:50,480
are half dead I like holes I like coffee cold I like creases in neat folds I like

122
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:57,039
signs that just don't know where they're going I like Angry poems I like the way

123
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,679
you can't pin down the C

124
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,919
see there's just for me I just feel so much delight with this poem and maybe I'll clarify that the

125
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,960
very last word c is H the verb like to see

126
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:24,158
visualize so I like the way you can't pin down the C and that's like the body of water the ocean and then the next

127
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:30,480
line is just C so feel like this is like an imperative

128
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,480
the poet is asking us to just see and what is it that we're

129
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,878
seeing well maybe we're seeing all the ways in which we don't have

130
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:49,000
unconditional regard for our fellow beings maybe we're seeing all the ways

131
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,320
that our preferences like push us around the things that we like and the

132
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,440
things that we don't like are we're always trying to avoid void what we don't like and move towards what we do

133
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:08,240
and wow how much of life's energy gets put towards or used up just

134
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:15,200
to move away from the things that we don't like or just even mildly

135
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:21,880
irritating and I have to say this poem is I just kept find myself reading it over and over because I kept on finding

136
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:27,520
all these little delightful things in it that I hadn't seen before

137
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:35,280
and I feel like this poet LM ceis has this uh not only the content of the poem

138
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,920
but the way there's this musicality there's this Rhythm to it that just uh

139
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,760
feels like it kind of feels like it builds up and there's maybe a crescendo somewhere in there and of

140
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:53,319
course that's part of the way that I'm reading it out loud to you all but there's a way in which it's

141
00:35:53,319 --> 00:36:01,119
written too and where the line breaks are it has this uh I don't know maybe some playfulness

142
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,880
too maybe this uh Whimsy that we can allows us maybe to

143
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,599
chuckle at ourselves as opposed to maybe be filled with shame or something to

144
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:20,880
this recognition like oh yeah yeah these are some of the things I actually don't like and uh here's this

145
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:28,720
poet just maybe highlighting that for us by saying these are the things that I like

146
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,400
so maybe I will say that this in with regards to Buddhist practice feel like

147
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:41,920
this poem is pointing to both cultivation and letting go maybe this cultivating the generosity of spirit

148
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:48,039
this generosity of heart and mind that is more

149
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:56,119
unconditional that isn't setting limits on what our heart can hold it

150
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:01,160
isn't setting limits on what the mind can be open

151
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:07,960
to instead maybe the poet is pointing out to all the ways in which we have set

152
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:15,640
limits conditions yeah I only like this but not like that but I feel like this poem is

153
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:21,119
pointing to the possibility of unconditional

154
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:29,160
warmth care kindness and maybe that's why the poem

155
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:35,880
like speaks to us I'll say it speaks to me partly for this reason just it points

156
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:45,880
to the potential for this unconditionality this Limitless care warmth

157
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:52,880
respect and I would say this poem is also in the same way maybe pointing to the same thing but using different

158
00:37:52,880 --> 00:38:00,599
language it's pointing to the possibility of let letting go of our

159
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:09,240
preferences I like this I don't like that and this quiet expectation that we

160
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:18,680
have that experiences things people please us or at least don't annoy

161
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:24,920
us and then this openness this acceptance really only happens when

162
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:30,560
there's not a strong sense of self and we've relaxed or abandoned or let go

163
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:37,280
or softened this strong sense of me against the world US versus

164
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:44,839
them I versus you and that has been let go of and softened then

165
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:53,000
everything something that we can like take Delight in or

166
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:00,280
notice see as the poet's using the the end see just to

167
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,200
notice so I would say part of the power of the poem is this

168
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:12,200
unexpectedness and maybe the sense of that it creates a sense of space in the

169
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:18,160
when you hear the poem or read the poem like oh yeah I don't have to say that I

170
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,240
don't like this or I don't like that so here it is I I'll read it one

171
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:30,960
more time I like Rex I like X junkies I like

172
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:39,280
flunks and X flunkies I like the way the career lless career I like flat beer I

173
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:47,880
like people who tell half stories and forget the rest I like people who make Doodles in important written tests I

174
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:55,000
like being late I like fate I like the way teeth great I like laceless shoes

175
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:02,520
cordless Blues I like the one bar Blues I like buttonless coats and leaky boats

176
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:10,119
I like rubbish tips and bitten lips I like yesterday's toast I like cold tea I

177
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:18,680
like reality I like ash trays I write and like crap plays I like curtains that

178
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:24,599
don't quite shut I like bread knives that don't quite cut I like rips and

179
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:30,960
blue jeans I like people who can't say what they mean I like spiders with no

180
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:38,760
legs pencils with no lead ants with no heads worms that are half dead I like

181
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:46,119
holes I like coffee cold I like creases and neat folds I like signs that just

182
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:52,119
don't know where they're going I like Angry poems I like the way you can't pin

183
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:58,240
down the sea see

184
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:06,039
I don't know I'm just I have a just a feeling of delight and I'd like to share this delight with

185
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:13,280
you and then maybe I will end our time together these five days of practice the

186
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,280
Poetry of practice with a another poem that I'd like to leave you with this is

187
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,720
a poem that also has some playfulness in it some Whimsy and but maybe some

188
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:32,880
encourag to help us practice with this unconditional noticing this

189
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,680
unconditional care this unconditional warmth to fellow beings fellow

190
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:44,160
situations to whatever life brings

191
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:52,000
us so this poem is called on International kindness

192
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,079
Day by Rosemary traumer

193
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:02,920
again I'll say it's called on International kindness Day by Rosemary

194
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,760
traumer and it goes like

195
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:15,280
this kindness went out and got itself a new engine a twin turbo premium unleaded

196
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,960
V6 cylinder engine something with real oomph something that provides a bit of

197
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:28,200
giddy up when the going gets tough turns out kindness likes

198
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:33,280
horsepower a lot of horsepower plus it's sprung for direct

199
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,079
fuel injection to maximize its power output everyone thinks kindness prefers

200
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:45,559
things quiet and calm but kindness is ready for action ready to Take On The

201
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:51,440
World ready to travel every back road every Highway every Main Street and get

202
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:58,160
this ever loving show on the road there's a whole lot of work to do

203
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:06,640
I love this kind of this idea right of kindness going out and getting a new engine and maybe that's what practice is

204
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:12,960
about maybe practice is about getting a new engine for

205
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:19,119
kindness kindness for ourselves and kindness for

206
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:25,079
others with some of this unconditionality sprinkled in

207
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:31,359
there maybe I'll read this poem one last a second time it's on International

208
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:38,160
kindness Day by Rosemary trummer kindness went out and got itself

211
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:58,040
tough turns out kindness likes horsepower a lot of hor power plus it

212
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:05,000
