1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:07,320
good morning good day good afternoon evening

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:14,360
um welcome back to the last of the series this week um so I'll begin with

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,840
um you know this is suta where the Buddha was teaching his son and one of

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:28,599
the uh aspects I want to I'll quote is um you develop meditation like

5
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:35,520
space just a space is not established anywhere in the same way when you're

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,600
developing meditation like space pleasant and unpleasant contacts

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,480
will not stay in charge of your mind one of the ways of thinking about

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:56,079
awareness is like a big open sky a big spacious sky and the objects that arise

9
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,280
in the mind are like birds or clouds floating by

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,360
rain falling thunder or lightning sometimes the sky is lit by

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,799
the sun sometimes by the moon or

12
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:21,640
stars so awareness can be thought of like the vast space in which all the objects of mind arise and pass

13
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:28,799
away appear and disappear the objects of mind as you know are the

14
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,200
sensations and sounds or thoughts and memories or

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:41,880
feelings emotions moods all our reactions to our

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,040
experience and they all appear and disappear in this vast space of

17
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,439
awareness everything we experience is constantly changing

18
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,200
it's constantly moving awareness isn't is undisturbed by

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,840
it all in in inside practice we give

20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,879
careful attention to the details of our changing experience but we can also step back

21
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,599
from the details and pay attention to the spacious field in which they

22
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:27,560
occur between every changing object there is space and

23
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,360
stillness so let's

24
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,560
sit take a relaxed and alert

25
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,560
posture and gently close your

26
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,599
eyes might begin with a few deep breaths

27
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,560
and with each exhale relaxing a little bit more

28
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:10,040
deeply relaxing into your cushion or chair into the earth that supports you

29
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,879
allowing the breath to return to [Music] normal breathing

30
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:51,920
in breathing out as we breathe we can become aware of

31
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:59,400
the air outside of our body it's the same air inside of our

32
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,400
body we're breathing in and breathing out there's no

33
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:13,640
separation between inside and outside the same air that the bre trees

34
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:21,160
create the same air we're breathing

35
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:28,320
inside outside flowing back and

36
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,400
forth connected by breathing

37
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,040
we can become aware of a wider sense of feeling the whole

38
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,960
body as if the whole body is

39
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,080
breathing breathing in and breathing out

40
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,000
allowing the body to relax to

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,080
soften to open letting go of any ways it's bracing

42
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,478
itself it's

43
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:39,440
tensing allowing the body to relax calming anything that can be

44
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,440
relaxed the face the

45
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:54,720
shoulders any tensions in the back allowing the belly to be

46
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,600
soft arms and the

47
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:21,478
legs breathing in and breathing out as if the whole body is breathing

48
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,840
as you are aware of breathing with your peripheral awareness

49
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,440
you can become aware of the spaciousness that's all around

50
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,960
allowing yourself to just know it just letting it be while you breathe

51
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,120
with it thoughts might arise in the

52
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:56,199
space sensations emotions we can allow them to come and

53
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:03,680
go just breathing in and breathing out

54
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,280
allowing any movements of the mind to relax to

55
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:18,680
soften to settle down on their own no need to reach out to

56
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:27,000
them no need to push them away in the wider field of

57
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
awareness any of these movements can arise and pass away

58
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,399
the spacious mind has room for everything

59
00:13:51,600 --> 00:14:00,480
whatever arises and passes can do so in this vast field of

60
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,639
awareness everything is flowing and changing

61
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,079
within a vast stillness

62
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:57,440
if the attention has drifted gently bring it back to the

63
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,360
present breathing in breathing out

64
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,000
resting in awareness

65
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:17,910
[Music]

66
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,039
so um I'll begin with um a cartoon I

67
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:49,240
saw um there's a school of fish swimming deep in the ocean and one of the fish

68
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,919
says "Are we there yet?" So in

69
00:30:54,919 --> 00:31:01,279
um mindfulness practice we take a lot of care to get to know to understand our

70
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:08,880
thinking mind but that understanding is for a purpose the idea is to have freedom with

71
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,960
our thoughts however they are whether the mind's busy or if the mind is

72
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:22,159
exquisitly silent the Buddha said the dharma is good in

73
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:28,039
the beginning in the middle and in the

74
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:35,720
end in other words um it's good even if we spend most of the last meditation

75
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,720
distracted that awareness that brings us back is a moment of

76
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:47,120
freedom that awareness that sees the painfulness of the angry mind is a

77
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:54,720
moment of freedom the quote I read yesterday refers to

78
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,000
this taste of freedom this taste of

79
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:08,399
non-clinging just as this great ocean has one taste the taste of salt so also

80
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:15,840
this teaching and practice has one taste the taste of

81
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:24,960
liberation when we're mindful not clinging we get this taste of freedom

82
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:30,200
regularly a moment of mindfulness is not a moment of

83
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:37,159
clinging even if we're mindful of clinging that mindfulness is not

84
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:43,760
clinging so we can practice with that taste and experience that freedom

85
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,919
throughout the day these little moments these little tastes of

86
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:57,039
freedom and we can also live with the promise of freedom both a taste and a promise can

87
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:03,799
guide our lives we can have freedom with a busy

88
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:10,600
mind with restless thoughts freedom is there to be

89
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:19,279
found just one moment of not clinging not grasping it's there right there not

90
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:26,080
resisting it not pushing the moment away but attending to it with care allowing

91
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:33,000
it to flow the busy mind is not a

92
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,080
failure it's not a mistake it's there from the conditions

93
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:44,039
in our lives it takes only a moment to stop fighting

94
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:50,640
it to stop feeding it to just watch it do its thing until

95
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,840
it settles on its own

96
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:05,200
one of the classic teachings um uh one of the images for meditation

97
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,679
in the in Buddhism um is the image of a muddy

98
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:17,520
pond someone comes along and stirs up the bottom of the pond and all the mud

99
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,599
what needs to be done to have a clear pond is to leave the pond alone to allow

100
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,079
all the sediments to settle out the pond will become clear again all

101
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:36,398
by itself when we resist our experience

102
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:44,358
it's like stirring up the pond um Zen master Suzuki Roshi

103
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:50,800
said "When you meditate don't be bothered by your

104
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,800
thoughts they're just thoughts

105
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,320
so as we reflect on this

106
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:18,960
path this eight-fold path that the Buddha walked before us we can recognize

107
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,160
the forwardleading nature of this path to freedom it's a path we're going

108
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:31,400
somewhere we may be inspired by the idea of being free of greed hatred and

109
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,520
delusion or maybe the idea of the full blooming of our

110
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,838
hearts a heart that loves like the sun without

111
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:49,520
limits the idea of being at peace but also as we've been meditating

112
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,240
together this week moment by moment opening to our

113
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:02,200
experience we might also connect and this is um the title of one of Amma's

114
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:10,920
books uh and we might also connect with being nobody and going nowhere

115
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,839
and both of those are essential the forwardleading nature of the path and

116
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:27,000
being fully in the present moment in that moment being nobody going nowhere

117
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:38,640
there's a difference between having an aspiration to freedom an aspiration to free the heart

118
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,320
from the defilements and striving to get

119
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:51,560
there the difference between striving and aspiring is

120
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:57,119
suffering duka striving comes from the delusion

121
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,760
that what really counts is what's coming up and at this moment is somewhat not

122
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:11,359
enough lacking a bit not quite right it's what's coming up that's

123
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:19,280
good uh when I was in school I was regularly bored so I would

124
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:26,640
deeply contemplate the huge clock on the wall watching the seconds tick by just

125
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,320
waiting for the bell to ring once this boring class is over then I'll

126
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,680
be happy so to find myself at times echoing

127
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,040
that sentiment and meditation was an unwelcome

128
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:50,400
surprise i spent many of my much of my time during the years of education

129
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:57,599
striving to get to my real life once I graduated but once I began to work I couldn't wait

130
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:04,640
till the weekend i thought that's where my real life is but then I um during the

131
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,000
weekend I take a long drive to visit a friend and I'd often find myself leaning

132
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,800
forward and then voice would show up are we there yet are we there

133
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:27,680
yet striving has a contraction a tightness aspiration has a lightness of

134
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,839
heart we can climb a mountain with the aspiration of getting

135
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:45,119
to the top with a brightness of heart maybe inspired by the panorama we'll see when

136
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,720
we get there and on the way each step we take

137
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,320
can also be an arrival sensing the beauty around us

138
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:03,440
feeling our bodies walking on the trail sometimes we run into boulders on

139
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,560
the path that we need to climb over the boulders aren't wrong for being

140
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:14,119
there sometimes the path seems

141
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:20,359
easy and we're just enjoying the experience the sun on

142
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:28,000
us the beautiful sky the warmth and sometimes it's rough and

143
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,720
grally and awkward and sometimes it's deep and and

144
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,280
challenging and sometimes it's just easy downhill

145
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,520
sometimes the body aches the feet get tired but as we continue on the path we

146
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:55,000
don't leave our tired feet behind we bring all of who we are up the

147
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,119
mountain aching feet and

148
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:08,520
all but we can also climb that same mountain with a tide or grim

149
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:14,040
determination to get to the top to accomplish

150
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:22,520
it another checkbox of what we've done in our lives either way our body might show up

151
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:29,119
there but it's a very different experience we've climbed a very

152
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:36,480
different mountain with being nobody and going nowhere we

153
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,480
can be fully here if we're nobody we don't need to be

154
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:49,760
different in any way nothing has to change nothing has to happen this is the

155
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,400
taste of

156
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:02,720
freedom aspiration to freedom inspires us to keep choosing

157
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:10,079
what's wholesome to keep choosing the path even when it's

158
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:19,680
hard aspiration gladdens the heart if we're complacent or discouraged

159
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,520
the aspiration can lift the heart

160
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,000
and if we find ourselves striving remembering that we're being

161
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,440
nobody and going nowhere it can bring us back to

162
