7

8
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:26,319
if you're sitting the spine reaches ever so gently

9
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,959
Towards the Sky

10
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,800
you give the rest of your body to

11
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,040
gravity the body kind of longing for the

12
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,840
Earth heaviness groundedness of our body

13
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,840
e

14
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:57,079
dropping down into your belly out of your head

15
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:08,720
it's like the center of gravity of your own [Music] body moves

16
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,159
down to the belly

17
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,120
it feels like our point of view is up in our

18
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,880
head that sort of headquarters

19
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:12,120
what's the point of view from the perspective of your belly

20
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,639
soft belly releasing tension

21
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,639
belly

22
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
relaxing

23
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639

24
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560

e e

27
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,479
if there are uh pockets

28
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:30,440
of hyperarousal little zones of your body

29
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:37,518
the emotional circuits of your body firing

30
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,360
off very

31
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:51,519
active just gently massage those

32
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,120
zones with your

33
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,440
awareness your breathing e

34
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,720
forever our bodies have been convincing

35
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,600
us that everything is

36
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,680
urgent something must happen

37
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,240
we're no longer willing to

38
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,240
listen if there's a true alarm we'll know

39
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:38,800
and in the meantime we treat all

40
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,480
phenoma it's false

41
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:01,639
alarms is unifying our body in a field of of

42
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Tranquility

43
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240

e e

52
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:52,759
it seems like problems find us the Loose Ends of uh our day or

53
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:01,120
week but uh sometimes there's not so much problems finding us but our

54
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:08,760
agitation finding a placeholder and so we withdraw the

55
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,760
projection

56
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:24,400
out and become uh radically accountable to what our body mind is doing Moment by

57
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,000
moment radically accountable

58
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,400
but

59
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:50,240
blameless we keep unifying our body into a kind of

60
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,200
field of

61
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840

e e

87
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:23,360
okay folks so

88
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:31,120
um new uh new biography I saw of uh just reviewed of Leonard

89
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:37,279
Cohen who uh I sat with a little bit at a at a Zen Center in

90
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:43,360
LA and uh so this is what uh this is how the

91
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:50,240
this biography begins uh Leonard Cohen's art

92
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:59,760
derives from a very specific visual ACU he sees men fall and with them women

93
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,840
Saints and Angels hence a Fascination for falling

94
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:12,720
bodies in a career devoted to a methodical and quasi Amorous exp exp

95
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,639
exploration of the laws of gravity his subject how and why we fall from what

96
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:25,679
Heights along what trajectories his stated goal to assert

97
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:32,279
with required rigor the unfathomable beauty of falling

98
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:37,440
bodies armed with the Visionary force that alone makes you

99
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,120
see the world exactly as it is he sharpened his tools along the way a

100
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:50,600
voice so deep it leaves us charred a tur and increasingly lethal writing style

101
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:56,279
and his unique combination of angst Jewish mysticism and Christian and

102
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:01,600
Buddhist flirtations along the way he fashioned a world that

103
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:10,159
is uniquely his own yet a lot like ours quite predictably the result is

104
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:17,679
ferocious songs that Comfort us with little waltes but are also spiritual weapons

105
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:25,320
that aim for the heart and never miss what do they say what we already

106
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:33,240
know the Invincible Gra gra ity of existence that we die that our heart

107
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:41,559
cooks and sizzles like shishkabob in our breasts that the apocalypse has begun

108
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:47,960
and the flood has already happened that God has summoned us for a

109
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,600
game of hide and seek that he clearly intends to

110
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,840
win in a word that we hang

111
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:04,638
dangerously between gravity and

112
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:16,039
Grace so why do we

113
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,000
practice we've all figured out by now that it's

114
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,039
not reliably fun can be

115
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:37,760
but it's definitely not always fun between gravity and

116
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:46,159
Grace the Dharma was never plan a you know no one

117
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:54,799
none of you not one of you when you were a child said when I grow up I'd like to hear

118
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:01,600
Matthew Bren silver talk about Dua not one of

119
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:09,040
you it takes uh time and

120
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,878
effort and while practice is not meant to be humiliating sometimes it is it's

121
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,320
just like you can't really sit with yourself look at your

122
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:28,800
own heart mind you look at that long enough and you'll be humbled at least sometimes

123
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,800
and at uh at moments it feels like we're we're

124
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:42,839
swimming against the stream of like a million years of evolutionary

125
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:49,440
conditioning and it's confusing practice is confusing the question can linger for

126
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:56,639
a really long time am I getting it that sense

127
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:05,079
of kind of defective person longing for something

128
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:12,960
remote where is it little homesick lost something how do

129
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:19,920
I find it that can linger for a long time and it's almost like the basic

130
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:27,880
worthiness the kind of inocence is so big we can't see its edges it covers

131
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:36,320
the entire field of vision and so we we can't even see our

132
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:45,800
innocence Cohen wrote uh about 25 years ago about his zen zen master zen

133
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:51,280
teacher um said I I never really understood what he said but every now

134
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:58,240
and then I find myself barking with the dogs or bending with the

135
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,880
irises or helping out in other little

136
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,760
ways no one can understand uh what the Dharma is at the

137
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,560
beginning how deep it runs how wide its

138
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:23,200
scope what it might

139
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,640
strengthen and what it might tear down in our so-called

140
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,960
lives you you really don't know what you're consenting

141
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:41,400
to gravity and the grace and it's a little bit like going

142
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:47,160
into the doctor and giving you know inform

143
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:54,440
consent to remove a tiny mole or something and then she's

144
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:01,520
like we're gonna operate for like

145
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:09,560
decades and so here we are here we are you know somehow

146
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:16,040
like together the blessings of the Dharma raining down through the

147
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:22,880
centuries and we're here together somehow on

148
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:29,119
YouTube so why do we practice we each have to uh we each have to answer that

149
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:36,400
question we'll have to ask and answer it many times we outgrow old intentions

150
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,240
maybe the question was immature maybe we

151
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:49,920
solved that we have outgrown it maybe the problem

152
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,480
dissolved and then it's like okay what now and no teacher can really answer

153
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:02,359
that question for you the the practice is

154
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:08,640
uh purely about intrinsic motivation and that isn't something

155
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,800
anyone else can give to you for

156
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,040
me you know why do I practice it's a little bit like

157
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:27,560
asking you know why do you love someone you could give answers you could cite

158
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:34,720
their characteristics you could say oh their kindness or their humor their whatever but that doesn't really capture

159
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:41,839
the Love Somehow love feels um beneath the level of conscious

160
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:48,160
awareness we cannot specify why we love someone something it's like that with

161
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:57,760
the Dharma there were some points when I really didn't know why why why seemed

162
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:05,559
besides the point in a sense I just knew I wasn't going to stop

163
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:13,520
practicing sometimes the Dharma is simply about having ruled out the alternatives to

164
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:20,520
wisdom and love yeah the the path it's hard but the

165
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:27,400
Alternatives unbearable and so auna said the right

166
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:35,599
the cup the cup you know the cup is already broken the flood is already

167
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:42,599
happened and I really don't know how people live without some practice some

168
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:49,920
relationship with the sacred and it's like you develop enough

169
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:57,760
sensitivity and Clarity around suffering and then you know you need a path

170
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:06,200
something doesn't have to be this but something is needed God summoned us for a game of

171
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:11,640
hide and seek that he clearly intends to

172
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:17,920
win and as a kid the the life in front

173
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,319
of me um even

174
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:29,920
when you know when I could imagine it even when in those fortunate moments I could

175
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:37,720
imagine it going pretty well it didn't look like a path to me really

176
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:47,200
didn't looked maybe like pleasure but no fulfillment no heart

177
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:53,520
satisfaction hanging dangerously between gravity and

178
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,240
Grace and it was like okay is it supposed to

179
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,920
be this hard am I doing something wrong even with all the good fortune in my

180
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:13,200
life is it actually supposed to always feel like

181
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,920
falling and something in life just felt cyclical

182
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:26,359
and they kind of so fatigued by an ambivalence that was so pervasive I sort

183
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:31,920
of lived just in the shadow of

184
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,920
ambivalence and I wanted my heart to point in Just One Direction give me

185
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:45,680
something that allows all the arrows of my being to point in One

186
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:52,760
Direction and of course uh I could sense

187
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,800
even when young kind of the

188
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,720
aging sickness death the Heavenly Messengers losing everything how utterly

189
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:10,400
unprepared my heart was the body Cohen says

190
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,760
ferociously insists on gravitational rights just before he died the body

191
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,520
ferociously insists on gravitational

192
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:29,480
rights the Dharma is not a perfect consolation for all of

193
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,720
that uh but nothing

194
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:44,359
else except wisdom and love seem to matter at all at all in in the

195
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:51,720
end not a perfect consolation but uh enough

196
00:42:52,640 --> 00:43:00,559
enough and so I was uh I began practice I maybe say

197
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:07,119
stayed with practice because I was Desperately Seeking a path where wisdom

198
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,520
and love could coexist with the Deep

199
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:17,400
honesty about the

200
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:24,680
fall and we open to

201
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:31,400
this and perhaps we find find ourselves helping out

202
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:41,720
in other little ways I offer this for your consideration
