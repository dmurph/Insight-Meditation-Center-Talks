17
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,460
warmly invited to click on that link and become a member of the Google Groups

18
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:06,299
where information and and links and poems and things like that are shared

19
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,340
it's a pretty low traffic and also you can be keep in contact with the Sangha

20
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,520
so at this time I change the settings so that accidental unmuting won't be

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,340
possible and also chat is now changed so that

22
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:30,360
um chats will only come to me as the host but I ask you to keep that channel quiet during the guided meditation and

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,360
the little darmet because it can be very distracting to receive chats while I'm teaching but I'll open it up afterwards

24
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,480
and last but not least I will turn on the recording for the sake of Audio

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:07,560
practice what a beautiful um a way to to spend our time to cultivate

29
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,260
kindness cultivate Goodwill and presence for this very life or this life that

30
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:21,079
seems to keep passing very very quickly impermanence impermanence

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,440
um in in full in full force full regalia impermanence arising and passing every

32
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,720
moment of our life so so I wanted to to bring a couple of

33
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,599
quotes for us to to play with um tonight and

34
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,379
and they um they have to do with the passage of time and really how we show up how we show up

35
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,540
for our lives how the way we we intend to show up

36
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,840
um for ourselves and for others so couple of [Music] um

37
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,019
quotes one is one is by Alan Saunders you have

38
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:11,939
probably heard this one life is what happens to us while we are making other plans life is what happens to us while

39
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:17,820
we are busy making other plans and

40
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,280
um another one from Vivian Green which is life isn't about waiting for the

41
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,380
storm to pass it's about learning to dance in the rain

42
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,900
and here is the third one um by Anonymous life is what happens

43
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:40,979
when you're busy worrying about the future or worrying about the future so so these are the things I want to bring

44
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:48,600
in with the invitation not for us to worry about the future and let life pass Us by but actually notice if we do have

45
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,380
that tendency if we happen to have that tendency to to be worrying about the future or we're

46
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:04,020
not really be present with our lives so that's one invitation to really ah to land to land in our seats and be

47
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:10,139
present for this beautiful amazing mysterious challenging

48
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:17,400
um thing called our lives can we be present for it and not waiting for the

49
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:26,120
storm to pass not waiting bracing ourselves for it to pass but can we learn to dance in the rain with kindness

50
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,460
with patience with generosity with with gratitude with spaciousness for

51
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:40,919
ourselves and for others it's changing shifting our relationship to the way we show up for our lives for

52
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:48,300
the sake of ourselves and others and this is of course a a theme that we explore at happy hour cultivating

53
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,340
kindness and compassion and gratitude in these practices of the heart regularly

54
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,979
and this is another way bringing more leaning into the presence being present

55
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:04,620
with kindness with spaciousness for what is sort of bracing for it to be over can

56
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:10,620
we celebrate the the fullness the busyness the the

57
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:16,620
being as being as they are even if they are not exactly what we would want them

58
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:25,080
to be but they're here already can we be present for them with with spaciousness and and the sense of Celebration even so

59
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,660
so okay I think I've said enough to set the stage so I would bring these uh

60
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,900
themes in as we meditate together so let's let's arrive let's land

61
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,780
in our bodies and start meditating so

62
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:50,840
so arriving arriving in this body In This Moment In Time

63
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:02,160
and we invite our feet our legs to rest on this Earth

64
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,340
sitting on the chair letting the bottom of both feet to rest

65
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,060

66
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,720

72

aching our seat

73
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,779
making our seat on the earth in this present moment

74
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,019
as if experience comes and goes

75
00:08:52,019 --> 00:09:00,959
as if there was a revolving door comings and goings and yet as if we were

76
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:07,920

78
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,480

107
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:20,040
perhaps you can imagine yourself if you like as an attendant

108
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:27,060

not attaching getting clingy

114
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,319
jamming up the door

115
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:13,380
not joining any Travelers moving to the Future

116
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:21,860
or the past but just staying right here at the revolving door of the present

117
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:33,480
if you find the mind is wandering not a problem no worries it's okay it happens this is what Minds

118
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,140
do gently inviting

119
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:45,260
awareness to come and rest with the breath

120
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,640
resting with the present moment

121
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,100
where it's most restful right here

122
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,100
resting in the presence with a smile greeting

123
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:12,780
all visitors that come and go In This Moment all phenomena passing

124
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,960
through

125
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,100
and if it gets overwhelming at any point it's so much passing through just stay

126
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:40,760
with the breath just resting with the breath

127
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:03,860
being present for our life In This Moment and this passing moment

128
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:12,620
resting with the breath with kindness and good will

129
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,480
for ourselves or whatever is arising

130
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:34,260
and if there is currently a storm in your life challenges

131
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:41,400
is that possible imagine yourself just a moment

132
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,460
you imagine yourself dancing in the rain

133
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:55,020
learning to dance in the ring sort of bracing yourself for the storm

134
00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:01,039
to pass is that possible if not it's okay don't push it

135
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:11,460
maybe the heart opens it just a second in some way

136
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:20,840
to see yourself embracing what's difficult what's challenging being remained on being soaked

137
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,580
being undaunted

138
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,620
by the dilute

139
00:24:54,179 --> 00:25:02,100
there be a connection even for just one second a sense of uplift

140
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:08,760
or join the midst of this rain

141
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,240
the star the deluge

142
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,580
getting soaked

143
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,700
here here

144
00:27:53,299 --> 00:28:01,039
In This Moment this passing moment spacious moment

145
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:28,919
then as we turn to bring this

146
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:36,600
practice to a close feeling into this metaphor

147
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:42,960
or one more time if there are challenges

148
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,559
rain storms can we connect with the freedom of

149
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:55,200
getting soaked dancing singing in this ring even for a moment

150
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,240
if it's available if not it's okay

151
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:14,000
letting that go connecting with the metaphor

152
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:22,460
of sitting resting with the breath and breath and not breath

153
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:30,799
at the revolving door of experience spaciously present

154
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:37,200
here not leaving our post

155
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,500
going after experience into the future or the past

156
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,760
spaciously just here

157
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:55,340
with kindness Goodwill ourselves

158
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,320
and everything and everyone that passes through

159
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:07,399
these Gates these doors of awareness

160
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:16,820
and as we cultivate plant seeds of presence and kindness

161
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:24,779
may we meet ourselves with good will

162
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:29,820
may we meet whatever Rises with Goodwill

163
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:36,919
even if they're challenges with the spaciousness

164
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,159
as much as possible may all beings

165
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:49,640
be happy may all beings be free including ourselves

166
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:57,079
[Music]

167
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,039
to everyone thanks for your practice

168
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:12,360
so as I mentioned at the end we're working with a couple of themes one was this

169
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,760
this metaphor of sitting by the revolving door of the present moment

170
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:24,779
now-ness can be very helpful um metaphor some time

171
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:30,240
and greeting greeting everything that passes through with a

172
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,659
smile all all events instead of having a a sense of

173
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:42,299
aversion or clinging one or the other with phenomena that arises that was one

174
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:48,120
and then the other was this can we for a moment have the sense of dancing in the rain

175
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,399
and again a few quotes that they shared at the beginning connected to the

176
00:32:53,399 --> 00:33:00,240
practice today one is by Alan Saunders life is what happens to us while we're making other plans so the invitation was

177
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,000
to be right here with with the revolving door of experience instead of

178
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,580
connecting and accompanying some experience into the past or future as a training as a training of course might

179
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:18,120
have happened 100 times during this practice that you did that but we do it as a planting of seeds as a training

180
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:24,720
and this other quote by Vivian Green life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass but about learning to dance in

181
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,230
the rain um and it's funny because a few days ago I was listening to this

182
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:37,380
[Music] uh AI generated playlist of of songs and

183
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:42,480
something that came up in this song which I hadn't listened to for for a long time and her for a long time was

184
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:49,080
the song dancing in the rain oh yeah oh yeah what an interesting Happy song and what the concept of this idea of

185
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:54,960
Singing in the Rain I guess that's what it's called Singing in the Rain like oh um I think the lyrics were something

186
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:01,320
like Singing in the Rain oh I'm happy again how happy I am I'm Singing in the Rain I was like oh how interesting right

187
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,840
imagining us embracing The Rains of our lives and just dancing and singing in

188
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,940
the rain so so so it can really our practice and and that the Buddha taught

189
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:18,118
with so many similes so many metaphors my goodness the the sutas are filled

190
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:24,300
with very helpful similes and these metaphors they're really open us up to

191
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:30,960
possibility instead of be within breath be with the out breath you know yes those instructions are very helpful and

192
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,599
prescriptive but and metaphors can be so helpful to open our hearts and Minds to

193
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:44,940
to the possibilities that we know but um I I don't don't relate to perhaps as red

194
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:50,638
leaf if there were prescriptive same with poems anyway so

195
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:58,220
so with that I'd like to invite us now to to take advantage of practicing with

196
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:06,240
the community with the happy air community in small groups and the invitation The Prompt for small group

197
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,900
practice tonight is this um was there something about working with either of these metaphors that you

198
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:18,359
found supportive you found opening um or was there something particularly

199
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:27,180
challenging and you're welcome to again share from your own experience what arose or you can say past just be part

200
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:32,760
of the group and hold silent kind presence for yourself and others

201
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,339
perfectly fine you don't have to speak if you do choose to participate in the

202
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:43,940
small groups let it be a sense of kindness to yourself kindness to others

203
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:49,920
just like me we're just like each other we're just practicing cultivating our

204
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:57,320
hearts and Minds as as well as possible in this limited time called human life

205
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:03,900
and and share from your own experience no questioning no not directing the

206
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:09,619
group but just sharing your own experience and let let Let's uh

207
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:15,119
do reverse alphabetical order it's first name first name reverse alphabetical

208
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,060
order is the order of the groups and be kind to yourselves be kind to one

209
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:26,460
another just the breakout groups are also called breakthrough groups because

210
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,859
we often discover so much about ourselves about each other they can be

211
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:38,579
supportive so I'm creating the rooms now and take care of yourselves take care of

212
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:45,119
each other here we go the rooms will close in about 10 seconds

213
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,020
we'll wait until everyone gets back

214
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:02,640
okay the rooms are closed everybody's back

215
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:10,400
welcome back everyone and uh we have some time now for Reflections questions

216
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,660
comments how was that practice for you what did you discover

217
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:21,540
um and also what you discovered in the in discussing it perhaps in the small

218
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:29,099
groups with one another and if you haven't spoken in the large group ever or for a while I would love to invite

219
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:35,520
you to pull forward and if you've spoken recently um or often pull back and make space for

220
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,960
for those uh who haven't spoken receipt would love to hear your reflections

221
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:59,040
Lisa hi Nikki thank you so much

222
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,160
um I found myself kind of teetering between being it was kind of really obvious what

223
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:11,760
was coming up for me and the it was not a lot of in the revolving door like it was

224
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,520
okay this kind of emotional tangle of things that I was being with but it's like I was teetering between

225
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,740
like noticing a little resistance to it and then like

226
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:28,680
going into it like being in it and then versus like having okay A

227
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:36,260
little this the like friendly kind space around it and so it was like well

228
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,660
and then when it was passing at the end I was like is it really going like I don't know am I sure are like okay is

229
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:48,720
this you know so it was like that Nuance but yeah I don't know is that just something that like happens or do you

230
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:56,160
have any instruction or guidance around like the being in the Thing versus kind of

231
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,880
like coming out into kind of a space around it and I guess I associate that with like the singing or dancing part

232
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:09,180
and then the rain maybe is like my direct emotional thing that's happening

233
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:15,240
to me that I could yeah yeah yeah yeah it's beautiful I so appreciate the way

234
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:21,839
you described it actually this is lovely that that you observed that at some point you know you're you're um you're

235
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:27,000
in the midst of you're entangled it was like you're in the revolving door you're hanging out with all the people all the

236
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,060
things are coming and going and like okay and and and then there were some spaciousness that happened like oh yeah

237
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:39,599
it's coming and going it's happening but there's some spaciousness of presence uh and and you associate that with the ease

238
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:45,540
of dancing in the rain being with the difficulties or whatever it is arising and passing so so actually you describe

239
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:51,960
that beautifully Lisa that that transition yourself um and and in terms of any guidance or

240
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:57,480
support um I think leaning into the breath a little bit kind of leaning into

241
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:04,140
the present moment can allow that spaciousness but also an and and observing what you just observed about

242
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:10,800
oh yeah I can be in the myth there's there's a difference between the mode of being entangled with it and there and

243
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:18,480
and slightly different when yeah it's still a rising the uh but there's just a little bit of space of observing it uh

244
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:27,660
arising and passing so so um I think you already have it so I'm just basically uh affirming the wisdom

245
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:35,099
you already have and the way you engaged with it wisely yourself it's quite lovely yeah thanks Lisa that

246
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:41,640
is so great um and I actually changed I forgot to to open up the chat so it's all the chat is

247
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:48,740
open either to me individual privately or to the whole group uh Pietro

248
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,880
hi Nikki hi hello everyone so thank you for the well for the meditation and the

249
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,000
theme time passage of time and uh yeah I was just reflecting the group how

250
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,900
much time I spend in planning and worrying so that's very humbling

251
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:15,240
but yet I also I also have sometimes this experience I think oh yeah we all

252
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:20,460
have that of just boredom it happened today a lot at work there was just

253
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:25,980
boredom coming up and um and it's kind of like you want

254
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:33,240
time to go faster in those case and it's really sad because as you were

255
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:39,660
reminding us time is so limited our time is so limited and yet they're at this time those times those days when you

256
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:47,099
actually want to go faster so and and and it's not pleasant to be in boredom so I was just wondering if you had any

257
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:53,940
any suggestions ideas how to how to be with boredom especially when you're at work and maybe it's not as easy to just

258
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:58,980
engage in a different activity yeah yeah beautiful thank you so much for bringing

259
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:04,260
this up this is so important kind of the other side of the coin you know there's

260
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:10,800
a range of Human Experience right it was we realize we're spending so much time and thinking and we're losing out in the

261
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,040
moment and then we're losing out at the moment because we want it to end right it's a different way of wanting it and

262
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:23,160
either we're in some difficulty we're bracing for this challenge to I know it's or if it's boring and so so the

263
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:29,220
mind is really eating basically in relating to it to the present moment the way of pushing it away wishing for a

264
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:36,240
future moment and then when the future moment comes like oh wait wait I just missed out on that wonderful so you're

265
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,579
bringing out another aspect of it great so so boredom

266
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:48,060
um boredom is is such an interesting experience it's it's

267
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:55,020
um not so much about what it is that's happening uh but it's the relationship

268
00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:00,359
of our minds to what is happening so I will venture to say there is nothing

269
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:06,540
that is inherently boring including sitting with your eyes closed doing

270
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:14,099
nothing right that's not because there's so much that it's that is happening that we can become curious about so if if we

271
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:19,680
already know as meditators that we can sit with our eyes quiet and nothing is happening and yet it's interesting like

272
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:26,819
so wow we can become curious the mind can become more Curious and subtle about

273
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:33,000
the subtle risings and passings and in the mind and the body and just really

274
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,200
studying turning the awareness to itself to be curious even even if this can be

275
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:47,040
interesting as we know so how can whatever thing it is that you're doing how can that be boring can we bring more

276
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:53,579
can we bring more curiosity not just to the to the act itself to whatever it is

277
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:59,280
to the function that you're doing to can can we so two things I'm going to recommend

278
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,800
one is to bring curiosity and interest to the ACT to do whatever it is deemed

279
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,260
being boring to the task can I learn more can I do this with I don't know

280
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:18,300
Panache can I do this with alacrity can I do this with interest can I do this with Joe can I do this with a spirit of

281
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:24,000
service like you the task itself you can can I do this Singing in the Rain you

282
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,060
know can I you know can there be a lot of different attitudes that you can bring in to just explore to keep

283
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:38,040
learning to keep learning about yourself about the task um Etc and yet another whole area is

284
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:45,240
become curious about the boredom itself be really curious what is happening what

285
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:51,960
are the words what is the message right now that this is boring I don't want to be doing this oh really okay well tell

286
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:59,040
me why what's boring about it let's explore this together boredom explore how boredom feels in the body in the

287
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,859
mind the moment you learn to become curious about boredom

288
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:13,020
you are never bored it's and it's fascinating it's it's such

289
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:18,300
a transition it rarely does come up for me that I'm bored and yet yet there's

290
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:24,480
some moments like I've noticed that the mind's like oh bored like oh really oh it's six foot what is this mind state

291
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,760
that says boring like what is this mind State I wanna I'm curious about this

292
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:36,000
mind State and it just uh anyway it's it's it can any moment in life becomes

293
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,599
fascinating does that make sense Pietro what I'm inviting you to explore yes yes yes be

294
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:49,560
curious with boredom be curious with boredom and then you're not bored anymore yes yeah yeah and also challenge

295
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:56,579
yourself with whatever task there is with the attitude and with different ways to learn and serve and be with I

296
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:02,940
mean this task is it to serve use it to serve others are there other human beings that are impacted like how can

297
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:09,660
you relate to this to this task to to find more meaning more interest in it

298
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:15,000
thank you thank you thank you so much such a great question really great

299
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,880
question so so thank you all this has been such

300
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:27,660
an interesting period of practice in one of your texts a chat to me singing in

301
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:33,839
the rain is an energizing song it sure is so may you may you bring that in as

302
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:41,460
an inspiration as an inspiration um yeah so thank you all and how to

303
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:46,920
think about serving when doing chores and cooking especially when I'm bored but that's exactly you're serving your
