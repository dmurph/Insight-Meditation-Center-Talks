1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,760
okay

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:14,000
so hello and welcome everyone welcome to happy hour

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:23,119
so for today's practice

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:33,760
i'd like to talk about the secret to happiness this is happy hour so i figured we'd

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:41,200
talk about the secret to happiness what the subtitle of this this practice will do might be the

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,840
secret to happiness on zoo

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:54,320
so so the practice of meta the practice of

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,280
meta wishing well having kindness good goodwill friendliness

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,720
for ourselves others people we know people we don't know people we like people we don't like

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,880
equal opportunity friendliness and goodwill as part of this cultivation

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,479
and it does make our heart happier it's it makes us happier so what i'd like to talk about

12
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:30,520
specifically the the nuance that i like to bring in today is you know with the pandemic

13
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,759
[Music] many of us are still experiencing zoom calls

14
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,320
oh they're not going to go away anytime soon it is a part of or the way we're going

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,360
to be working uh remotely or or perhaps also even if

16
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,880
you would go back to work with people who are not local with us so so teleconferencing video

17
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:03,040
chat etc video work will continue to be a part of the way both we work and maybe we

18
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,080
socialize in groups so

19
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,760
so so this practice um is

20
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,319
you know how we wish well for example you know before before the pandemic the variation of

21
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,840
this practice was stealth meta if you got if you were driving

22
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,959
you would wish meta for people on the road and you would be calmer happier you

23
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:40,000
wouldn't be upset as much especially if people cut cut in front of you especially wish them

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,120
well ah really in order to to bring soothing and calm

25
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,879
and ease to yourself and you would arrive at your destination feeling uh much better similarly if you rode

26
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,800
the subway or buses oh you would be you would be wishing well for everyone

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,319
around now with with what i'd like to bring in

28
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,440
and this is a zoom practice meeting well some people are on youtube

29
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,840
but many of us are here on zoom you can see me you can see each other so this will serve as a perfect practice

30
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,480
ground for for many of the work meetings so

31
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:31,120
um wishing well so the idea the invitation is that we will practice the wishing wishing well

32
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,599
for people who are on a meeting with us and we'll bring that bring them to mind or you can

33
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,799
start maybe if you wanted to um you're able to put

34
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,599
in gallery view so you can choose someone to wish well for kind of warm up your your your meta

35
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:58,720
right now but really what i'd like to focus on is a practice that we can take to our

36
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:06,319
other zoom meetings other other work meetings in this way so so why

37
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,480
well some meetings actually many meetings

38
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,799
might you might feel tired bored it might be something like i don't disa i don't agree with this person ah

39
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:26,320
they're going on and on you know these little quirks we develop with people we know and and work with and and actually

40
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,440
choosing choosing to find something that either you appreciate about them

41
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,360
you like about them or some way in which you are similar the common humanity oh

42
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,880
yes you you're both dedicated to this work you were doing you both appreciate

43
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,160
whatever project you're working on

44
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,360
and finding a way finding a way to find common humanity and for those of you who are retired perhaps

45
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:03,360
i invite you to engage in this practice creatively creatively

46
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,000
cultivating meta is all about creativity so find other ways maybe you are going for walks

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and seeing people in your neighborhood or going to the grocery store and and feeling annoyed by someone's like

48
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,080
okay they're taking forever during the whatever 10 or less items and they have 30 items

49
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,360
check out lane you know there are all these ways that that we find that that would get

50
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,560
irritated so stealth meta this is stealth meta and

51
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:40,320
one one thing i want to bring in before we get into it into the practice is um that

52
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:47,280
some people say well when i'm in a meeting or doing something or other it takes too much um it's too

53
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:55,759
distracting to perhaps do meta for someone well yes and no so one idea could be

54
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,960
before you go into the meeting you know spend a couple of minutes imagining people you'll be

55
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,840
seeing you'll be either in a meeting with or even visiting in person again be creative you don't have to take

56
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,479
it exactly the script that i will be talking about be creative see what works for your life situation

57
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,600
um be your inner own inner dharma guide

58
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,080
so can prime the heart either before and also what i have found is that if i don't do

59
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,880
this practice actually i get more tired and more waned my energy gets kind of waned in the

60
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,680
meeting and my attention starts to not be here completely whereas actually when i

61
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,720
engage by you know different people in the meeting perhaps are talking i i wish them well i

62
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,880
even if i deci especially if i disagree with them or there's something i'm like i wish you well may you people and then

63
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,560
i all of a sudden i realized oh wow i'm more attentive i have more energy i have more good will i'm

64
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,599
more present in this meeting i don't feel like oh when is this going to be or i just i want to be done with this me

65
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:08,400
so he changes the way i perce i i show up i i'm present at the meeting instead of

66
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,880
actually being distracting it's actually the opposite so i challenge you

67
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,400
gently to see that for yourself to see that for yourself how you could

68
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,680
actually become even more present and available your energy will

69
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,360
be arisen aroused or risen

70
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,800
anyway uh there'll be more energy present with this practice instead of it being a

71
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:44,800
distraction stuff so i have said plenty to frame the practice let's practice to

72
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,039
be together ah i'd like to invite you

73
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:59,840
to land to land in your body

74
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,440
to arrive to come here

75
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,840
right here right now

76
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:42,800
feeling your feet on the ground or if you're sitting on the floor feeling your whole underside

77
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,760
of your legs

78
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,839
on the cushion feeling your bottom on the chair or the

79
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,000
contact points relaxing

80
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:09,839
letting go of your body weight into the contact points

81
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:22,959
feeling the connection to the earth let's just hang out here

82
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:30,640
feeling connected to the earth sensing feeling

83
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,839
appreciating the contact points

84
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,480
inviting your breath

85
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:21,519
to move through the body the lower part of the body

86
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,200
the abdomen

87
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,959
the contact points enlivening

88
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,600
bringing more awareness

89
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,839
to these sensations

90
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,839
deeply rooted and connected to all the sensations

91
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:49,680
inviting the awareness to rest the lower abdomen sensing

92
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,839
the movement the sensations of the breath

93
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:41,279
fighting your awareness to move through the body with the breath

94
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,199
calming relaxing letting go [Music]

95
00:12:51,440 --> 00:13:07,839
of any tightness or holding anywhere

96
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
okay

97
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:41,839
now i would like to invite you

98
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:50,320
as you continue to feel embodied feeling your bottom on the cushion

99
00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:02,320
contact point your feet your legs the breath moving through your body

100
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,839
here here

101
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,439
imagine you're in a meeting

102
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:27,279
it could be a zoom meeting an in-person meeting

103
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,880
or perhaps somewhere where there are others present that

104
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:43,759
you're interacting with in some capacity could even be a grocery store or a walk

105
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:51,839
in the neighborhood see what situation works for you best

106
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:59,440
for the narrative i will use i will refer

107
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,839
to meetings but again see what works best for you

108
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:21,360
as you are embodied feeling your body sitting

109
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,720
lying down standing

110
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,400
perhaps bring to mind a recent scenario

111
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,799
a recent scenario

112
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:47,840
where you were with others

113
00:17:52,160 --> 00:18:01,840
in a meeting perhaps on soon

114
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:15,120
again feel free to adapt to what comes up for you

115
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:22,880
feeling yourself rooted in your body with your breath and just take some time imagining

116
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:31,039
yourself present this meeting fully present in your body

117
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:43,840
not leaving the body in order to be with others

118
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,840
staying with the body staying with the breath

119
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:53,840
feeling your presence why you are imagining being in this meeting

120
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:29,200
starting with appreciation meta for yourself

121
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:49,840
for your work your work as service

122
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:02,400
appreciating your own goodness

123
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:10,080
your own intentions for service from

124
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:17,840
offering your offering to the world

125
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,080
may i be safe

126
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,200
happy healthy

127
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,279
and have ease

128
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,840
staying connected to your body

129
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:55,360
may i be safe may i be happy

130
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:09,840
may i be healthy may i have ease

131
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:53,278
and now feeling a body to continue to feel embodied

132
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:04,400
the sensations of your feet your sit bones your breath

133
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:11,760
whatever calls to you in your body feeling your presence with others in

134
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:18,320
this meeting or in this situation you've conjured up something that has happened maybe

135
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,559
earlier today or recently

136
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,960
and imagining yourself in relationship

137
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:38,080
with these other beings and as they speak or as they relate to

138
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:47,279
you as they're going about doing what they do in this interaction wishing them well

139
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:55,600
one by one perhaps starting with the person who was easiest for you

140
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,960
person who's easiest have most

141
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:15,840
warmth ease care appreciation perhaps for them

142
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,039
may you be safe may you be happy

143
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,720
may you be healthy

144
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,919
may you have ease

145
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:45,279
either sharing these metaphases or whatever metaphases you like or perhaps without

146
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:51,120
words just wishing them well wishing them goodness

147
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,720
and happiness in your mind's eye

148
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:11,840
staying connected to your body

149
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,840
staying with this first person for a while

150
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:39,840
a few minutes

151
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:14,320
you're welcome to move to another person in this meeting

152
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,840
in this group saving the person who perhaps is most

153
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:26,240
challenging for last i'll tell you when we have a few minutes left

154
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:41,840
or if you want to move to them earlier you're welcome too

155
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,600
at any point if you feel that you need some of this goodness and care feel free

156
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,679
to direct better to yourself

157
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:25,760
maybe it was a challenging meeting it's okay to hold yourself with care

158
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:33,840
and mental

159
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:31,200
if you haven't yet moved the person who may be more challenging for you the meeting this is

160
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:39,840
a good time

161
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,920
perhaps considering something the two of you have in common

162
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:17,838
seeing their humanity something you appreciate about them

163
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:25,760
or you have appreciated in the past that that be the basis for the meta

164
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,839
for your connection with them

165
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:05,520
or maybe simply that you're both human you're both aging you're subject to aging

166
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:27,838
you have a body subject to pain and illness you're not so different

167
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:44,240
for the last couple of minutes let's practice

168
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,320
sharing your mental your good will your friendliness

169
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,480
with all the beings in this meeting and this circumstance and this situation all of

170
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:03,359
you may all of us meeting

171
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,400
talking working together being together

172
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,000
and this cause in the service in this way may all of us

173
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:23,839
be well

174
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,200
seeing your connection through your common cause

175
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:54,240
even if you're imagining being in the grocery store for this common cause of feeding yourself

176
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,440
may all of us and may all beings everywhere

177
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:15,920
be safe be happy be healthy

178
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:33,839
and have ease as much as possible may all beings be free

179
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,839
thanks everyone thank you for your practice

180
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:57,040
so changing the settings on chat so you can

181
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:04,480
chat publicly with your reflections if it's sent to everyone i'll read your name if it's just to me it'll be private

182
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,480
i won't read your name and you can also raise your hand your zoom

183
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:17,200
hand especially if you haven't spoken for a while if you're new love to hear your reflections what you

184
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:23,200
discovered and um yeah

185
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:31,440
i see forest please nikki hi for this topic it's actually

186
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,560
perfect timing for me because i recently returned to work and

187
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:44,640
meetings that i feel like are a waste of time have been one of the things i was just trying to figure out how i work with and

188
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,880
during the meditation it really shifted my attitude because i realized that the meeting was not just about the work

189
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:57,119
it was also this kind of human um about the humanity somehow not just

190
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,838
the work so i'll definitely be bringing that with me

191
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:10,000
i am touched that i am so touched forest thank you for your words and your reflections i am

192
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,230
delighted i'm yeah i got your missive your mental missive

193
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:21,280
[Laughter] thank you so much you may this be of support to you and

194
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,920
what you say is super fun i do want to highlight it that meetings aren't just about the work

195
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,119
being done there's so much about the relationship but the human relationships these are the people

196
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:39,119
we are serving with we haven't chosen them they're kind of like our family we don't

197
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:47,520
choose our family and yet they can serve as our teachers and there's so much so um

198
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,200
and as you were saying that in the meetings where it could in the previously it was a

199
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:00,319
waste of time now it's no longer a waste of time it's practice time it's practice time meta practice

200
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:09,039
it's lovely thank you first other reflections please

201
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:18,160
and one thing that i'll share as i'll wait for you to raise your hand or type is um i've i've done this practice

202
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:24,319
especially in meetings where i felt it's long or there's as i mentioned at the beginning

203
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:30,800
um just yeah you know some meetings they have spark and some meetings are heavier

204
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:37,520
and i've noticed that my energy gets completely transformed and shifted

205
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:45,760
in the meeting okay it's time to do that i start smiling i start smiling at my to myself i start

206
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:52,480
smiling at others when i'm looking at them wishing them well it just and and it shifts my energy and also

207
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,839
i've noticed it shifts other people's energy in the meeting when that happens

208
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:04,720
um so this is your secret happiness happiness secret

209
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:12,000
happiness secret and zoom meetings not such a secret please spread it

210
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,800
any other reflections or thoughts you'll notice anything that maybe was

211
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,560
challenging too is welcome

212
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:35,040
again hi this is megan um i was thinking of a

213
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,079
zoom meeting that i had by phone last week with people i have yet to meet

214
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:46,400
um i have a lot of people to meet i just moved here to california so welcome

215
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:54,560
welcome to california megan yeah but uh it's also kind of scary and um there's a lot of nerves and

216
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,400
just a lot of like self thing when it comes to starting over and being in all of these

217
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:06,319
groups and so it was really helpful to like to bring meta

218
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:13,280
to that um with all these people i haven't actually met in person yet and think about like little things i've heard that i just really appreciated

219
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,480
about them um so i'm gonna try it in real life we'll see how it goes

220
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,960
oh that's awesome that's great i love that and also the actionability of of you know things that

221
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,640
you've heard you appreciate the bottom oh yeah yeah here it is um letting that be the

222
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:39,520
basis and also you know as we know meta is is a um antidote for

223
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:46,319
fear anxiety and various flavors of it so especially in the new situation may may

224
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:52,720
it support you may it profoundly support you make it that's great thanks for your reflection

225
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,960
marie christine says in chat i would like your life's subscription to the happiness club

226
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:05,119
that's great you already have one [Laughter] i love it i love it mine christine was

227
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,839
great very sweet

228
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:17,839
another thing also again feel free to raise your hand um another thing i've i've also done in

229
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:23,440
the past is sometimes um you know if people have a virtual background that's one thing but if they

230
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:31,359
if in their environment sometimes in the background you can see something that oh yes they like art

231
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,839
or oh they have a child's painting you know drawing in the back oh maybe they're a parent maybe they're a

232
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:43,200
grandparent there's something there's a way that you can really connect

233
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:51,440
um with with them there's so many ways to be creative and create the connection so

234
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:58,880
so speaking of that we are in the zoo meeting dear ones let's take this as an opportunity

235
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:05,119
for meta for one another so in a moment we will be in small

236
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:11,119
groups small practice groups and let's start

237
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:18,640
um by let's start by 15 seconds of

238
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:26,240
meta silent meta for each other and um then you can share as little or

239
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,599
as as much as you like but maybe in the background have a sense of meta for yourself

240
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:39,359
in the small breakout groups with others really actively and see how it goes

241
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:47,760
so so i'll create the breakout room rooms now and they are

242
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,040
open and enjoy

243
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:02,000
welcome back everyone so we have a few minutes

244
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,240

245
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:14,880

yes parents i just want to say how important this this group practices

249
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:07,119
i was you know before the small group thing i was this feeling kind of turned inward and

250

254
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:43,920

255
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:49,200
connection in this way and the safe supportive um as safe as supportive as we can make

256

it and taking care of each other really yeah glad to hear it thank you terence

257
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:07,838
other reflections please

258
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:17,119
yes melanie hi hi yeah i was

259
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:22,880
feeling the same level of gratitude for their breakout rooms and um there's one person in particular that

260
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:28,800
i've happened to be in a breakout room with a number of times just like seems a bit coincidental but like

261
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:35,119
there were like a few maybe like three or four times like we've been in the same breakout room together and he isn't here right now but

262
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:41,200
um we did the exercise together once of um uh like what brings you joy i think or

263
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:47,359
there was something where we repeatedly asked each other the same question i think it was like what makes your heart sore i think that was

264
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:53,359
the actual question and he was talking about how he like loves going to st farts and like running and like swimming

265
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:59,359
naked in the beach he's actually like not on the call right now um but i was like oh like

266
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:05,280
you know like now i just think of such joy i'm like you know he's not here but like you know i feel like this image

267
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,480
of feeling so happy for him like maybe he made it to saint parts and that's why he's not dialing in

268
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,800
um and so i i think that was key to what you were saying of like just like getting to know little parts

269
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:23,200
of someone especially like what makes them really happy and then being able to think of those it makes it much easier for the meta to

270
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,960
flow for them beautiful thank you melody i love it

271
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:35,280
it just makes my heart sing also as you talk about this makes me so happy

272
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:42,880
it's lovely that's a lovely lovely note to end on thank you both for those reflections at

273
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:48,000
the end of both terence and melanie and everyone else we shared
