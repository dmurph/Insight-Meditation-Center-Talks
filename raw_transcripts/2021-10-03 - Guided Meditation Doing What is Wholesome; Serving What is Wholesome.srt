1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,399
so so then good morning everyone or good

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:12,240
day welcome and um

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:20,320
one of the things that uh i delight in and and somehow find myself

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,840
re-delighted maybe surprised almost when i sit down to meditate

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,279
is the regularity of meditation the continuity of it

6
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,680
the way that meditating regularly creates a kind of both the rhythm of meditation but also a

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,239
sense of continuity sometimes felt like a momentum some

8
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,480
sometimes felt like a homecoming sometimes feeling like

9
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:59,440
a a ongoing inspiration this ongoingness

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,119
so it's not just that this particular meditation but uh it's the stream of meditation

11
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,520
just being in a stream or a river of something flowing that

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,520
continuous day after day or month after month year of the year decade after decades for some of us

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,799
so i'm delighted to be here and be in this meditation posture of mine and

14
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:31,200
maybe some of you uh if you're able or you have been meditating on a regular basis maybe you

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,560
too will feel that the delight or the

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,560
inspiration or the of that momentum

17
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,439
to go along with the talk i'm going to give today

18
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,360
i'd like to suggest an exercise mindfulness exercise and if it's too

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,880
busy and goes against the makes you more agitated then peaceful

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:06,479
you're welcome to put it aside but the exercise is um when you um

21
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:13,840
find yourself when you're mindful of anything very lightly with a kind of light open

22
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,719
general touch without making it a lot of work or um anything

23
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,840
uh kind of ask yourself if i keep doing this

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,200
what is the consequence is this consequence beneficial for me or not

25
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,640
is it a healthy consequence or not um

26
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,000
maybe not so much in their final results but just like on the ongoing doing of it

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,720
does it feel like it's um you know a good thing to do and um

28
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,000
and whatever answer you have you get you know you don't don't think about it or to analyze it and if it's not obvious

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,920
just continue what you're doing but ask periodically it's particularly relevant if you get

30
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,319
pulled into the world of thoughts is if i continue in this realm of thinking

31
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:15,840
is this going to lead to a good result or in and of itself is this does it feel like it's a useful thing or healthy to

32
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,840
be involved this way or is it more beneficial for now more healthy

33
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,159
to come back into the meditation to shift the attention out of the world of thinking and

34
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,200
thoughts and concerns to hear to let something here

35
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,280
be known be settled be connected

36
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,840
and i know in my meditation often there's a after sitting for a few

37
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,599
minutes uh it's quite common to to kind of see and recognize a shift

38
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,439
where i've been thinking somewhat and then i say you know that's not sometimes my system

39
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,480
feels that's not the place to be and i'll settle back

40
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,879
and um settle in to be connected to something that's deeper or fuller or much more beneficial

41
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:16,560
even even i'm thinking about good things it's so much better to um

42
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:24,160
to come to this healing place settling place calming place of meditation for these minutes

43
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,199
so taking a assuming a

44
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,600
meditative posture and

45
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,240
lowering your gaze relaxing your gaze letting your eyeballs kind of rest in

46
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,560
their eyes and if it's comfortable you can close

47
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:59,520
your eyes and in a way that is calming

48
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:08,520
a calm way of doing it take a few long slow deep breaths

49
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,319
long slow deep breaths

50
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,120
and as you exhale calmly relax soften

51
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,039
gentle your body

52
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,319
and then calmly return to a ordinary

53
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,560
way of breathing breathing in and breathing out

54
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,759
and as you exhale relaxing parts of your body

55
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,039
may be a global relaxation the whole body

56
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,960
relaxing with the weight of the body into the surface that's holding your

57
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,120
body up from

58
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,000
your seat your cushion your bed whatever it might be

59
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,199
and maybe as you exhale relax in your belly

60
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:22,479
thereto may be allowing the weight of the belly as you relax the belly the weight can

61
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:30,319
gently settle down to a good foundation

62
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,599
for the rest of the torso

63
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,080
on the exhale relaxing the chest the heart center

64
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,720
and if there's tension or ache in that area

65
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:03,840
soften around it it's okay for it to be there for now just hold it gently softly

66
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,479
see if you can be relaxed about it being there

67
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,680
on the exhale relaxing the shoulders

68
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,759
releasing them to the pull of gravity

69
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:51,640
and on the exhale to soften the muscles of the face maybe letting the lips be slightly apart

70
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,600
the teeth may be slightly apart so that the jaw relaxes

71
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,959
and softening the forehead and around the eyes

72
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,880
and on the exhale relaxing

73
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,680
the mind whatever tension pressure heaviness there might

74
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,640
be associated with thinking

75
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:48,079
tension in the forehead in the brain

76
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,240
temple area maybe the jaw

77
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,240
whatever physical tension there's associated with thinking

78
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,720
as you exhale

79
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:15,319
relax releasing the mind from tension

80
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,320
and then settling yourself into your breathing

81
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,040
shifting away from thoughts and concerns

82
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,480
into an embodiment where you are

83
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,760
you're present attending

84
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,680
accompanying the body breathing

85
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:06,240
in whatever way you're using your attention whatever gets the focus of attention

86
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,600
does it feel healthy for you to do so the way you're doing it

87
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,839
is it in some way that feels

88
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,920
beneficial if it doesn't feel healthy or beneficial

89
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:30,880
how you're being it how you're being attentive or what your attention is going towards

90
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,560
see if you can shift it to something healthy to a useful way of

91
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:46,640
paying attention to a useful thing to focus on

92
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:53,360
and hopefully something like the body the body breathing

93
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:02,680
is a useful place to attend and if not then maybe sounds

94
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,959
here now

95
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,480
foreign

96
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:37,760
yes we come to the end of this sitting you might with your mind's eye

97
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:44,559
turn your gaze outward into your world of

98
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:53,200
communities you know communities you're part of

99
00:30:53,200 --> 00:31:00,159
out cross the lands and as you bring these to mind and

100
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,000
in a sense gazing out upon the world

101
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,360
in that gaze in that awareness is there any

102
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,960
anxiety or fear

103
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,640
that feels not healthy or beneficial

104
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:31,039
and can you shift that to gazing from a place of

105
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:36,320
feeling secure confident

106
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:46,720
as you gaze out upon the world is there any sense that the gaze is

107
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,799
influenced by aversion

108
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,360
irritation frustration

109
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:09,519
and if there is can you shift it to something that's healthier

110
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:17,360
shift it to a gaze that's informed by kindness compassion

111
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,799
care for others

112
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,600
and if they gaze out upon the world seems to be

113
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,679
filtered through desires ambitions

114
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,960
wanting something for oneself

115
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:02,320
can you shift it to something that maybe feels more healthy or wholesome

116
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:09,960
perhaps a gaze of generosity goodwill

117
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:22,320
and perhaps at the end of obsession of meditation you're a little bit better able to

118
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:29,279
notice the ways in which we are aware of

119
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:37,279
and to shift it from something that feels beneficial not beneficial to beneficial

120
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:43,440
not healthy to healthy unwholesome to wholesome

121
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,559
and in this way maybe we can dedicate the benefit of the

122
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:55,519
meditation out into the world for the welfare and happiness of all

123
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:02,640
beings anyway that we've benefited from today

124
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:11,200
from sitting and meditating together may it spread out from this meditation community out into the wider world

125
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,480
for the happiness the welfare of all beings

126
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,398
may all beings be happy may all beings

127
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:28,720
be safe may all beings be peaceful

128
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:35,079
and may all beings everywhere be free

129
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,920

130
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:46,079
thank you um sorry for forgetting to turn off the

131
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,119
microlight drink um

132
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:57,359
so after this talk uh when i will have a community meeting i'll open up the meeting and

133
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,560
when i have time after we finish but to talk about the opening of imc we'll

134
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,800
do a gradual opening and it'll start in a few weeks and the details of how that happens and

135
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:17,440
the kind of the process by which people can register to come and be here in person i'll talk about that meeting

136
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,280
and uh the link to the meeting is found at the very top of this chat

137
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,680
you might be able to either click on it or maybe you have to cut and paste it's also found on imc's website under

138
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,200
the section called what's new in the bottom right hand corner there's an announcement about this meeting

139
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,280
and there too you probably have to cut and paste the link i don't think it turns out to be clickable

140
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,720
and and then also on the imc calendar there's a listed the community meetings

141
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,079
listed there they're also the it's been posted but maybe not clickable so

142
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,160
you have to cut and paste and it's the password is meta

143

145
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,079
so

146
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,160
so um today i'm going to talk a little bit

147
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,760
about a discourse of the buddha that um

148
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:34,720
i find kind of inspiring in its simplicity it's very repetitive so in years past i

149
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:41,119
would have i just kind of glossed over it and didn't really read it carefully but and now lately i find it very

150
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:47,760
meaningful in its repetition and its simplicity and um and the context we're giving it

151
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:54,560
is uh kind of how how i'm feeling after a very full week of all kinds of

152
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,920
input from this world around me i did a retreat i taught a two-week

153
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,280
retweet that ended last sunday a wonderful experience of being absorbed

154
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,400
kind of in the world with dharma and in a sense kind of came out of it

155
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,079
into the wider world again to experience many things that are difficult and

156
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:22,960
wonderful in this world of ours and uh i mean the big one that uh had a big

157
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,000
impact on me was reading about and the

158
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,640
the covet 19 situation in the united states and in the wider world

159
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,800
and and also talking to people who work in hospitals and their experience there what's happening

160
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,720
there and around the hospital and reading you know reading about these things and

161
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:53,440
it's so tragic how many people are dying and sick and impacted from the illness

162
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,960
but the tremendous strain on the hospital systems and hospitals in various states overflowing and

163
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,279
people not being able to find hospitals they'll take them because they're all full

164
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,839
and and but i'm also struck by the

165
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:19,599
tremendous uh um fault lines of tension that exists in

166
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:25,280
this country are exacerbated through this uh the whole covet 19

167
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,280
crisis and the level of uh animosity and hate in all directions

168
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,560
um that is being spread and been

169
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,599
and acted on is uh kind of astounding for what is an illness

170
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:47,440
that illness in which many people are dying and

171
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,160
you know the beginning of the pandemic there was uh you know fair amount of last year a fair

172
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,599
amount of discussion about superheroes the medical

173
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,640
first responders and hospitals and nurses and doctors and staff

174
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,800
and who were not vaccinated and were kind of showing up to support and to help and try to

175
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,480
offer medical care to people who were sick and dying of coping so doing it at

176
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,760
their own risk of their own life and um and there's that still happening

177
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,960
and it's kind of frustrating for them that with the vaccine available that they still

178
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:33,040
you know they're probably vaccinated most of them but still it's dangerous for them and that they have to

179
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,800
experience so much death and you know some of these people in the

180
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,319
hospital doctors nurses chaplains staff are witnessing multiple deaths a

181
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:51,359
day and day after day day after day when they go to work but also that

182
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:57,440
there are some hospitals there are demonstrations outside the hospitals where people are angry at the medical staff

183
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,280
for treating kovid for the whole divide between the

184
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,560
the antibacts and the provacs people and antibacks people coming and

185
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,800
denying there's even covet and i've read about the nurses who will take off their

186
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,520
uniform and have no medical in you know badges or uniforms at all if they go into stores

187
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,960
and local stores because if they do people hate them they get get attacked

188
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:33,040
at least verbally and now it's like they don't feel safe i heard a story of people who are going

189
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,079
to work to try to help people from dying from covid

190
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:43,119
who had to go through a gauntlet of protesters who were yelling and hating at them

191
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:50,240
to do their medical care so it felt so painful to read and know and learn about these experiences

192
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,599
that are going on and so on so many fronts and i wanted to what do i say

193
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,440
how do i talk i felt like i had to talk say something about it in a dharma talk and

194
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,160
what do you what what do i say and then other experiences during the week that are very much on my heart that

195
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,599
also led me to what do i say here so i decided to talk about this

196
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,880
particular discourse discourse which i think many people would read and not

197
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,000
find it inspiring find it dead you know

198
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:31,359
soporifically repetitive and dull somehow but uh i don't think that was the case

199
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:38,880
when it was originally composed was composed in oral culture and the repetition was part of the song

200
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,000
the rhythm the there was a rhythm there was a tune there was a lyricism to it

201
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,119
and the chanting it in unison in the monastic communities and it was kind of like a

202
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:57,040
a song which repeats its lines over and over again and and it has a kind of rhythm of where it affects the heart and

203
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,480
washes through us and and makes it you know these really great dharma points are just washing through

204
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:10,240
and and they didn't have couldn't write back then either so if you wanted to have um

205
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:17,359
you know remember something you you didn't write it down and then check it later you had to really memorize it and

206
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:23,920
so to memorizing this rhythmic kind of way of repeating the same kind of thing with slight switches changes was

207
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:30,240
probably very effective in an oral culture maybe not effective in a written one

208
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:37,760
and and so this text is number 114 in the middle link

209
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:45,680
discourses and it's uh uh it's it's uh it's uh

210
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,560
the discourse on the word sevi taba means

211
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,000
there was a seva some of you know seva is a kind of a indic word

212
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,640
that uh it means to serve or to help someone there's an organization that

213
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:10,480
ramada started called seva that is doing humanitarian work in

214
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:17,200
in india and other places and and so it's just this word and the word

215
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,359
means to serve it also means or to attend to

216
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:30,800
it also means to practice and so i love this idea that the word means both that somehow we practice

217
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,200
in order to serve it's a way of serving um uh one translation the most common

218
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:44,240
translation uh translates what should be cultivated and but with cultivated that misses the

219
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:50,480
idea that um that there's a kind of little little bit of a devotional quality to it

220
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:58,160
of serving of helping what should we serve you know what do we give ourselves to in a nice way

221
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:04,960
and it is practices it's talking about so and this teaching is uh

222
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:12,560
is uh the buddha gives a very simple teaching and then um

223
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:19,200
without any explanation and then the buddhist disciple sorry puta follows up with an explanation

224
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:25,359
explanation what it means the buddha then approves of that and does it more simple teaching

225
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:31,599
sorry buddha explains and then the third round the same thing at the end of which the buddha says if

226
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,720
to summarize it if lay people

227
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,160
listen to this and apply this in their lives it'll be for their long-term

228
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,839
happiness and welfare and um and uh

229
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:53,280
it's interesting he specifies laypeople and uh in a sense it's a little bit like

230
00:45:53,280 --> 00:46:00,800
secular buddhism there's nothing about rebirth there's nothing about

231
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:07,119
all kinds of liberation anything that makes it more complicated or more kind

232
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:12,800
of religious for some people it's uh here are some things you can do that

233
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,160
that is beneficial for you how you can live your ordinary life if you pay attention to this

234
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,400
and um and nothing religiously really is asked of people it's kind of uh secular practices that

235
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:31,920
way uh however it also points to the heart of what of the buddha's message and something very central to how he orients

236
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,520
himself and how it buddha starts he's talks about what should be done and what

237
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:43,359
should not be done or what's what one should serve and what one

238
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,400
should not serve what what's your practice and what one should not practice

239
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:54,720
and uh and then he goes through a list of things so it's you know there's this dichotomy that's put up there

240
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,760
and in that you know we're always doing something whether we're thinking or

241
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:06,240
using our body for something or speaking in some way what criteria do we use

242
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:12,400
for what we do with our body what we do with our speech and also what we do with our mind and how we think

243
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:18,640
and don't just leave it a chance don't let it kind of go amok by itself

244
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:24,960
but have some presence of mind to notice what we're doing and then to make a choice between

245
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,000
different things what do we serve and

246
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:36,480
the um and so the buddha goes through makes this list he says

247
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,319
there is conduct of body that one should serve

248
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:49,280
and contact of the conduct of the body that one should not serve there is conduct of voice of speech that

249
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:55,440
one should serve and conduct that one should not serve there's conduct of mind

250
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:02,079
that one should serve and conduct of mine which should not serve then he goes on says there are

251
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:08,720
dispositions of mind that one should serve dispositions of mind that one should not serve

252
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,319
there are um perceptions here we are kind of the

253
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:20,880
conceptions of the world conceptions of things that we should serve and conceptions that we should not serve

254
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:27,680
there are views opinions stories of the world and ourselves that we should serve and ones

255
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:34,160
we should not serve and then there are this is an interesting one for many

256
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,200
people people struggle with buddhist ideas there are identities that we should

257
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:45,520
serve and identities we should not serve and um this kind of way of thinking is

258
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:50,640
kind of central to the buddhist teaching which means that

259
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:56,720
it's avoiding of categorical teachings about what one should do

260
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:02,160
categorical teachings about what kind of views perceptions conceptions

261
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:07,839
dispositions and even identi identities that one should have or

262
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,880
shouldn't have and some buddhists have this categorical idea that you should have no identities

263
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:20,400
you should let go of all identities when you're practicing but here the buddha doesn't want to reject everything in some category or

264
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,160
accept everything in some category and he's always asking the question

265
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,920
looking at well there's some that you should some way you should do it in some way you shouldn't do it

266
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:38,240
and and uh and uh so that's all the buddha says

267
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:44,480
and then his disciple sartuta says well let me explain further buddha says sure

268
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:51,359
and sariputta says what when if what you're doing is unwholesome

269
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:56,800
uh don't do it if what you're serving is wholesome keep doing it

270
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:02,079
if what your uh your disposition is unwholesome

271
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:08,559
then um don't do it if it's wholesome do it if the identity

272
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,920
you're holding on to your living with is unwholesome and he explains it as

273
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:19,920
unwholesome leading to affliction it's unwholesome and it's harming you

274
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,920
don't do it but if it's wholesome leading to non-affliction then it's fine

275
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:33,359
to do it so there's always for the so sorry put this evaluation for what to do and not to do

276
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:38,400
is based on this idea of wholesomeness and unwholesomeness which

277
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:45,119
sometimes is translated as skillfulness and not skillfulness and which is it points to the it's consequential it's

278
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:50,400
considering in doing this what are the consequences um

279
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:56,000
and uh if it's skillful consequence beneficial consequences that are

280
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,880
useful for you then do it and and that if not then don't do it

281
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:09,359
and so here there's an evaluation process that each person can do for themselves these are not categorical

282
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:14,960
teachings of anything about how to behave about

283
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:21,520
ethics necessarily a little more nuanced than that but

284
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:26,720
or about views you know and some people will not like this text because it's so

285
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:32,960
dualistic they'll say what should be done and what shouldn't be done there's two things that are standing in opposition it's a

286
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:38,000
binary and like there's doesn't leave any other room for something and

287
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,400
and but that's a view and so the you know what about non-dualism

288
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,440
and the buddha would say there is a a way

289
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,800
to serve non-dualism that's one should do and a way of serving non-dualism one

290
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,839
wants you not to and how if it's wholesome to do it do it if it's

291
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:06,319
not wholesome don't do it and so having this kind of uh guide this

292
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:11,920
perspective each person becomes their own teacher their own guide their own

293
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,599
person finding our way forward and because the word for skillful also can mean

294
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:23,920
very close to the english word for ethical it's how we become our own ethical

295
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:29,119
guide and it's being what's wholesome and unwholesome

296
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:34,960
and this is so crucial to the buddhist teachings that we would be have our own ability

297
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,400
to recognize this quality of all the things that

298
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:47,599
we're going to do in body speech and mind and to track it and so when it's unwholesome

299
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:54,160
uh it feels painful it has an ouch in it there's an ache there's a contraction there's

300
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:00,640
tension there's stress there's a closing down there's the unwholesome uh

301
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:06,480
uh undermines the person who has it so things like anger

302
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:14,559
hostility delusion um greed are the primary representations

303
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:19,920
of what's unwholesome that undermine the person who does it the

304
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:26,800
ancient language they talk about these things greed hatred and delusion burn the person who has them

305
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:32,880
so they might be outwardly directed wanting something or being hostile to someone else

306
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:38,720
but we're harming ourselves when we do it so

307
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:45,599
it isn't always so like major like the harm but there's a feeling of of tension stress even sometimes

308
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:51,520
something gets lost some a self-alienation when things are done wholesomely there's

309
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:58,240
a whole other way of feeling it it feels um it doesn't feel uh

310
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:03,680
deflating or diminishing or or doesn't have an ouch it has more of an ah

311
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:09,680
it has more of a feeling of of uh yes to it there's a feeling of opening of

312
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,800
relaxing of a delight or warmth

313
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:21,359
a feeling of wholesomeness not everyone associates in english the word wholesomeness is something that

314
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:26,400
feels so good but the when i was a kid the advertisements for

315
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:34,640
bread talked about wholesome bread that's my big association with the word and um these adverti commercials on tv

316
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,920
and and i think the idea was that it was nutritious but when more than nutritious

317
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:45,040
is kind of felt you know comfortable like maybe some

318
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:51,680
food that we grew up with at home that uh a parent made that just felt like more than just tasty it was felt like

319
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:58,240
the parent's love came with it was so nourishing in a psychological way it's kind of what i associate wholesome

320
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:03,440
with so we do things that have this beneficial effect

321
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,799
and for some people this is a new idea that we could be tracking ourselves

322
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:14,079
carefully with mindfulness and make simple choices

323
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:22,799
away from what is unwholesome to what is wholesome um away from what has kind of

324
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:30,319
uh not has an ouch and towards what has an ah nourishing for us

325
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:36,240
away from what is de-nourishing unnourishing us and that and to be sensitive to one of the

326
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,599
purposes of mindfulness is develop a high intensity to that very difference

327
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:48,400
so that we can choose to be nourished and so it isn't just simply being mindful in the present moment and just

328
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:56,319
that's enough of it but it's doing being mindful in the present moment so we can make these simple choices as they're obvious

329
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:03,440
of how to do something and it could be as simple as how we make a meal

330
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:10,960
if we do it uh tense in a hurry resentful if we do it um afraid about you know

331
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:17,280
will they like my food or not that's a very that's kind of not that's has a little bit of an ouch to it

332
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,400
but if we do it with an inspiration and joy and love and generosity as part of

333
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,839
it just delighted that we have people we can feed that has a very different

334
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:32,880
feeling for it done from love and um

335
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,838
the um the um

336
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:43,520
uh so to kind of track this to know it and then to kind of begin to know

337
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:48,559
kind of smell the direction almost second nature that's the way to go

338
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:53,839
to what's wholesome and and this is the way

339
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:59,760
that hopefully we can find our way in a fractured society of society that

340
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:06,000
has a lot of tension in it and a lot of hatred in it and a lot of greed in it

341
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,559
that we don't want to contribute to that we want to contribute not the not to the

342
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:17,599
unwholesome but to the wholesome unwholesomeness produces more

343
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:23,839
unwholesomeness is a teaching of the buddha wholesomeness produces more wholesomeness

344
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:32,079
for oneself and also into the world so unfailingly dedicatingly committedly

345
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:38,559
living a life that's committed to the wholesome the ah the beneficial that which is

346
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:45,119
nourishing that's which is inspiring that which is for the greater welfare and happiness of all

347
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:51,280
beings we don't always know what that means like in terms of actual things in the

348
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,640
world should we vote for different kind of taxes or not what kind of tax system should we have

349
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:03,520
what kind of electoral system should we have and so all these big questions that are difficult to you know agree on let alone

350
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:09,599
really have answers for but be very careful not to lose sight of the

351
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:15,040
wholesome in discussing these don't sacrifice the wholesome

352
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:20,799
because of views and stories and opinions remember what the buddha said there are

353
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:26,079
some views that one should serve and some views one should not

354
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:32,559
serve and uh and um those views that

355
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:38,079
are wholesome and have wholesome consequences those should be served

356
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:43,119
but those which are unwholesome not to be served

357
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:50,480
and it isn't just the views but it's how we hold views how we use views how we speak of our

358
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:56,079
views there's a way of speaking about them and the way of not speaking about them

359
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:02,960
i what i felt most since felt inspired to talk about

360
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:09,119
in the wake of so many challenges that exist in our society and may it be that we are

361
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:14,400
a wholesome contribute to the wholesomeness of our society

362
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:21,680
the nourishment of our society so that what is really good and beneficial for the welfare and happiness

363
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:29,200
of every single person in our society including the people who are so often forgotten and marginalized

364
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:35,599
or that we don't include in our hearts let us include everyone in our hearts even the people we disagree with

365
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:44,240
so that our attitude towards them is wholesome even if we disagree with them
