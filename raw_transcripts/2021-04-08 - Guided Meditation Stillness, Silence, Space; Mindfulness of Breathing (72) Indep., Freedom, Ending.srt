1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:09,680
so a warm very warm hello to everyone and

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,760
it's a wonderful thing to gather together this way for meditation and as an

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:25,920
introduction to this meditation and also maybe as a you know coming to

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,840
the end of this long series on mindfulness of breathing

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,320
the um there are sometimes things in our life that happen that

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,440
really get our attention like wow that and our preoccupations concerns we

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,520
normally have just immediately fall away because this like well now you know we're really here with this and

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,719
um and there are some wonderful places we can go

9
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,920
in the world where no matter what we're doing or thinking it really

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,799
gets our um

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,000
you know our attention and for me it was uh going to a small chapel

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,240
in france when i was 18. and it was a thousand-year-old chapel on top of a hill

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,520
and i entered into it and it was the silence and the stillness that was there

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:34,960
that was so powerful that something happened inside of me that uh felt very intimate and warm and

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,960
connected and still silent and uh it was a quality quality that

16
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,320
you know it was kind of like wow and so there in terms of this path of

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,520
meditation and the maturity of it coming into full maturity of its potential

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,960
there are things that then get our attention and one of those things can be silence

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:11,520
and a profoundly peaceful and open and sweet silence

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,480
it can be a phenomenally profound and protective

21
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,280
safe feeling of stillness that is not stillness of being frozen

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,800
but stillness of a early morning dawn someplace maybe

23
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:38,640
outdoors and everything is still before before the animals the birds wake up

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,760
before the wind picks up sometimes it's spaciousness

25
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,120
that gets our attention that things are vastly

26
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,239
just seems like there's just lots of space around everything

27
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:01,280
and uh and the spaciousness is so satisfying so expansive so

28
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:09,280
almost liberating maybe that it gets our attention and these qualities of silence and

29
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:17,040
stillness and spaciousness in a certain way they're always here

30
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,480
silence is always here but the silence gets filled with noise

31
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:30,000
and we don't often hear it stillness is always here in some kind of way

32
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:38,000
but it gets filled with activity and spaciousness is always here

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,760
but are there's ways in which it just seems like things have gotten claustrophobic

34
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,080
and in the mind it can be this way silence stillness spaciousness that's so

35
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,640
nourishing so wonderful that it gets our attention and when in meditation

36
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:04,080
the practice deepens far enough to really feel these qualities in the heart and the mind and in awareness

37
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,840
it's kind of hard to put words on where it is or how it is some people will feel like it's just

38
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,079
everywhere and um and it when it's strong enough

39
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,680
and clear enough then uh there's a way in which then

40
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,800
afterwards we realize that those qualities are ever present

41
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,840
in spite of the noise there is silence here

42
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,479
beautiful silence in spite of the activities and busyness

43
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:45,440
there is stillness and in spite of the claustrophobic and

44
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,440
the things you know being crowded or a lot of things happening

45
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:59,040
there is spaciousness and when this feeling for

46
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:06,240
orientation towards the silence or the stillness or the spaciousness that's here

47
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,680
becoming becomes easy i don't know easy is the right word

48
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,560
exactly it becomes available to sense to feel to taste

49
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,960
to hear to feel in meditation

50
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,320
that can become a basis for the meditation a support for it or

51
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:39,840
orientation for it or or nourishment for it or a context for our meditation

52
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,720
so

53
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,639
entering into a posture that allows you to be still

54
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,160
some modicum of stillness with your body

55
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,960
sitting alert or present or

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,080
and allowing your body to settle into a

57
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,039
stillness maybe taking a few long slow deep breaths

58
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,479
and relaxing

59
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:49,840
into the stillness of the body

60
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,280
as you exhale to relax parts of your body

61
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:11,840
allowing the relaxation the relaxing muscles to relax out into the spaciousness

62
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,759
that's here as if there's lots of space

63
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,360
to receive the releasing of muscular

64
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
tension

65
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,800
you're relaxing the belly

66
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,639
the shoulders the face

67
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:01,919
and then relaxing the thinking mind or any physical tension or contraction

68
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,360
associated with thinking agitation

69
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,280
or softening quieting your thinking

70
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,879
so that you're also aware

71
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:26,080
of a quietness within or even a silence

72
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,439
between your thoughts

73
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:42,640
around your thoughts silence underneath your thoughts beneath

74
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
them

75
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,800
and breathing in a normal way

76
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,480
perhaps you can feel the space just beyond the edges

77
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:20,839
of the sensations breathing the space beyond the edges of your body

78
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
breathing

79
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,760
if you're aware of your torso moving as you breathe the space around that receives the

80
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:51,839
expanding chest expanding belly

81
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,360
and as you're sitting here aware within

82
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,600
of any stillness that's here

83
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:49,120
next to whatever movement and movements there might be in their body

84
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:56,240
in your mind next to it besides it underneath it

85
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,959
inside of it is there any place of stillness

86
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,399
and perhaps the breathing movements of breathing

87
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,120
sensations occur

88
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,079
within the stillness

89
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,839
with the stillness

90
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,639
beyond the edges of your body is space

91
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,560
with no clear feeling for the line between

92
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:10,000
the edge of your body and the space around it

93
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,279
their spaciousness space also within the body

94
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:25,839
breathe with the space in a spacious environment

95
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:51,279
in silence trust the silence of silent mind

96
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,760
a quiet place within

97
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:06,959
breathing with the sweetness

98
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:21,839
of quietness and silence within

99
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:49,199
and very gently maybe tenderly

100
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:55,360
can you also allow your awareness

101
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:06,480
your mindfulness your knowing your very way of being

102
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:16,560
have qualities of stillness

103
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,920
not moving towards or away from anything

104
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:34,560
awareness even sense of being has qualities of

105
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
silence

106
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:04,079
quietness maybe awareness which is not based on

107
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:19,199
thinking maybe because it's larger than thinking

108
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:27,839
more spacious than thinking can ever be

109
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,120
and allowing awareness itself for your very sense of beingness

110
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:44,800
to also have qualities of spaciousness openness

111
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:55,839
that may be peaceful

112
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,519
and it isn't that everything becomes silent and still and spacious but

113
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,480
rather recognize that which is silent

114
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:23,199
still impatient spacious

115
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:30,880
and as you exhale relax into that place

116
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,199
breathe with it

117
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:44,160
for these minutes trust the simplicity

118
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,839
of not being involved in what moves

119
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,240
what has noise in it and static

120
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,959
and which is contracted in spatially limited

121
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:19,839
just open here

122
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,919
you

123
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,519
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

124
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:50,320
maybe in the way that silence is ever present between

125
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,879
and behind underneath the noise that fills it

126
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,799
where stillness is ever present

127
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:11,200
spaciousness as well maybe in the same way

128
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:19,679
love is ever present in all it in any of its forms

129
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,840
simple caringness

130
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,240
kindness tenderness

131
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,398
friendliness compassion

132
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:48,960
appreciation and perhaps if we are quiet enough for

133
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:56,480
sensitive enough we don't tr drown out

134
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,840
the ever-present love that's in our hearts here

135
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,600
and maybe it's a love or a tenderness or a kindness or

136
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,278
maybe if it could also take the form of respect and devotion

137
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,440
which is which exists or which

138
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,120
touches on our relationship to other

139
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
people

140
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:56,840
it exists in the mutuality of our lived lives

141
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840
together

142
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:16,158
and may it be that as the meditation gets quieter and stiller and more spacious

143
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:29,200
that these beautiful heart qualities nourish ourselves

144
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,200
and we recognize it that the nourishment comes also

145
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,200
as we shine it on others

146
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:59,200
may it be that whatever known or unknown

147
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:08,320
kindness that lives within us love that lives within us

148
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,278
be shared with the people in our lives

149
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:23,840
people on this world in ways that

150
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,760
is for the benefit and welfare of all beings

151
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,279
may all beings be happy

152
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,559
may all beings be safe

153
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,720
may all beings be peaceful

154
00:30:49,039 --> 00:31:05,840
and may all beings be free

155
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:29,760
so over these now over 70 talks

156
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,120
and guided meditations

157
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:46,000
i've been we've kind of gone through a particular discourse of the buddha

158
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,440
called the discourse on mindfulness of breathing mindfulness of breathing in and breathing out

159
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:02,480
and the heart of it is these very simple

160
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:11,360
almost like cliff notes maybe instructions on mindfulness of breathing

161
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,679
and the text goes on and there's more teaching the buddha gives that builds on these six or extends

162
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,799
these 16 steps mindfulness of breathing that also represent the

163
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,320
development and the growth the onward leading nature of this practice

164
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,559
that as we do this practice something gets born inside something begins to unfold or

165
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:41,039
express itself and a variety of things and and some of those

166
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:47,840
things are called the seven factors of awakening and the way it's presented in the text

167
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,519
it isn't so much that we practice the seven factors of awakening as it is

168
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,360
we recognize them in other places the buddha is quite explicit that in some of these factors

169
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,840
of awakening the very recognition of them is the nourishment the food that allows them to

170
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:11,919
keep growing so this this organic growth of something that happens as we

171
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:18,800
really have starting to learn how to give ourselves over and trust this process of being aware of our

172
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:26,638
breathing being aware being present not caught up in our thoughts and distractions and preoccupations

173
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,598
learning to be with ourselves in a caring way

174
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,240
and and so these seven factors awakening develop and they're called factors of awakening

175
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,679
for two reasons one reason is that they are

176
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:52,000
they set lay down the foundation or lay down the conditions upon which awakening can happen

177
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:58,400
and in the word buddha means the one who is awake it comes from word awake

178
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:06,240
and buddhism is in a sense could be translated into english as awake-ism and that it's the it's the

179
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,640
ism that has to do with liberation with freedom of mind of heart in such a way that

180
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,320
something wakes up some kind of awareness

181
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:25,280
when a person has a first taste first glimmer of this what this awakening is this liberation is

182
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:32,160
so much so that it gets their attention it really oh this is central this is

183
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,680
really what this practice is about or this is how this is the cen this this i want to make

184
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,800
this the center of my my life nothing else is as important

185
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:50,400
even the tremendously valuable love and compassion i have for others nothing compares to freedom

186
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,720
a freedom that allows the love and compassion to be clean and and supportive for everyone

187
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,160
including oneself so that we have first taste of that

188
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:09,040
that's called it's described sometimes in english as entering the stream literally the language in the pali is

189
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,400
entering the current of river and if you can stay in the

190
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,680
current it'll carry you all the way to liberation

191
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,280
and so learning to recognize that current uh learning to stay in it and be to be

192
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,359
carried by it then becomes part of the practice after the first glimmer

193
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:36,640
and um and so the text this this course on seven factors awakening

194
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,680
uh ends with a little section that's there's a lot of ellipsis so it's not always does not really

195
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,440
spelled out all the way it's very short and i think it's really easy for people reading a text to just

196
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,480
skip over it and not see it but what it says is it picks up at first

197
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,760
the it talks about the seven factors of awakening how they

198
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:05,359
rise out of the practice of mindfulness and then it goes on to talk about how

199
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,480
those seven factors awakening come into play and how they develop and keep growing and

200
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:17,520
and support us after awakening and that is now they are based

201
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,520
on something they are based on and i'm going to give you my kind of

202
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,280
adaptation of the pali words because the pali words

203
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:36,160
if they're translated literally into english i think doesn't mean as much for an english-speaking audience but the

204
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:42,320
kind of the the value that the um the fullness of these words are closer to maybe what in

205
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,760
english in the best senses of the term terms

206
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:54,240
would be now they're based on a sense of independence someone who's entered the stream enter

207
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,640
the current is said to be independent in the dharma now they know what the dharma is for themselves

208
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,680
they know and they don't need more books or more teachers or anything and they just know

209
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,440
and they know what the practice is about so they're in there's an independence

210
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,960
they're based on independence and it's based on freedom a sense of

211
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,280
real freedom that we're no longer in bondage or entangled in things and so there's a

212
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,599
sense of feeling of freedom and there's a a sense of

213
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:37,760
that all the suffering all the attachment and clinging something

214
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,480
conceits we have there's a there's a stopping there's a phenomenal

215
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,720
ending that's happened it's always here

216
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:56,720
and um and these three qualities independence freedom and kind of the

217
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,160
ending of is um are usually in english translated

218
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,560
as and we've seen them uh no no i haven't seen all of them but one of them is translating english as

219
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:14,079
seclusion the other as dispassion

220
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:20,000
or the absence of dispassion or the fading away of

221
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,880
clinging and the third is cessation which is and those last two the fading away

222
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,560
dispassion and the cessation that's in the anapanasata

223
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,320
step 14 and 15. but now these qualities are kind of

224
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,839
available to a person they've experienced a degree of independence a degree of

225
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:50,480
freedom a degree of the stopping cessation that is memorable now it's ever present

226
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,680
in some kind of way it's not that it's always aware of it but it's just like right there sitting on

227
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:02,079
your shoulder or close by just like in the guided meditation i talked about silence and stillness and

228
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:08,079
spaciousness kind of always here in some kind of fashion that once we have a clear

229
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:15,280
really clear experience and powerful experience of those uh maybe there's always some sense that

230
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:22,240
these are ever present as well when love is associated with this then

231
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:29,920
some people say that yes love is always present and um or when all these together maybe

232
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:37,119
uh give a sense of real peace peace is always present and um

233
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:44,319
and so so with with awakening something quality of that awakening uh remains

234
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:50,560
available or is recognizable and then it becomes a basis for doing

235
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:57,040
the practice further and so now we know what the practice is about and now the idea is

236
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:04,560
now we want to practice in harmony with that we want to practice in the with in that

237
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,680
spirit or in those attitude of those so that um

238
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:16,160
uh if if part of it is uh this independence seclusion

239
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:23,760
that we want to do it in a way that when we practice the awareness itself has a feeling of being independent from

240
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,599
what it knows independent of what we're aware of we're not entangled or caught in it

241
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:36,400
we want to recognize how to be free where the freedom is in

242
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,599
awareness there's no freedom in clinging and wanting more and expecting and

243
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:47,440
or no freedom in reacting so this is terrible i'm doing i'm a bad meditator or i this shouldn't

244
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,839
be here this is embarrassing of course there's all these ways we're still not totally free

245
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,920
and there's all kinds of things that arise and bubble up and the mind gets busy and distracted and

246
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,960
difficult states of mind might arise but it's possible that at some point that in

247
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:13,359
spite of those we don't get tricked by them we don't get pulled into them we stay independent of

248
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:21,680
them and we stay free of them so we're not caught and entangled they still arise

249
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:29,359
but because we're independent and free of them there's a disinclination of identifying with them

250
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:35,599
i was saying this is who i am this is who i and then there's this last quality of

251
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:42,480
something has ceased something has stopped and one of the things that stopped is

252
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:50,319
uh is um the preoccupation beliefs um attachments

253
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:57,280
to ideas of self ideas that tend to bring conceit and self concern and this

254
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:05,280
stopping of of self-preoccupation self-concern being self-consciousness not totally

255
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,440
but to have some flavor the feeling of that a taste of that and letting that be part of the

256
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,920
mindfulness as well where the mindfulness is not entangled or caught up in being self-conscious or

257
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:24,800
self-critical there's a clear sense that awareness itself is free of this self-concern or

258
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:32,000
self-preoccupation or self-identity kind of things that we're doing and so mindfulness then becomes a very

259
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,520
different quality it becomes mindfulness becomes more an expression

260
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:45,200
of the dharma moving through us then it is so much something that we are identified as the doer

261
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,720
or the agent of we're more the to the degree to which we're an agent we're more the enabler of

262
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,920
it we get out of the way of it we allow awareness to be there

263
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,800
and we notice uh in this field of freedom and independence and and something has

264
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,240
stopped there's space for everything and that's why i like to think that

265
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,760
liberation in buddhism is we give liberation to everything else

266
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:20,000
everything is becomes liberated from our entanglement and concern rather than i am liberated it doesn't really make

267
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,079
sense anymore to say i am liberated i'm free and

268
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:33,040
and so over and over again we've seen the suttos in the teachings of the buddha that the ultimate goal is described in

269
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,640
terms of kind of of negation a liberation is kind of a negation

270
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,318
of being entangled being in bondage we're free now

271
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:53,599
seclusion or independence is a kind of liberation from being dependent in an unhealthy way perhaps

272
00:44:53,599 --> 00:45:01,440
and or being claustrophobic in the middle of all kinds of concerns and cessation or ending of

273
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:09,599
something is is an ending of something of suffering of clinging

274
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:16,720
so there's a strong tendency for the buddha to repeatedly give the the ultimate goal of

275
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:21,920
what practice really is taking us as defining it as an absence not as the

276
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,400
presence of something if he talks about the presence of something that most he seems to do

277
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:36,079
is to talk about it as in terms of peace and what's i think beautiful about this

278
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,200
is that even the experience of liberation you know that they can feel palpable

279
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,400
feeling of freedom and independence and and absence of suffering

280
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,920
is when we're free

281
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:58,960
there's no inclination to make it into something to make it something we hold on to

282
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:05,680
make it to say that it is something the presence of something because then that's already even even

283
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:13,160
asserting presence of something is a way of kind of a little bit grasping and clinging this is this

284
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:19,599
uncompromising attitude of just trust letting go being free

285
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:26,319
being this you know the mind not clinging to anything and in doing that there's this beautiful

286
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:34,079
way in which there's maybe a nourishing stillness silence spaciousness

287
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:41,599
maybe that's interpenetrated with love and compassion and care and wisdom

288
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:47,280
it's not being frozen it's not being disconnected but it's not exactly the same as being

289
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,800
connected either it's being free so the

290
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,400
the practice of anapanasati ends this way it ends with this

291
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:05,520
reference point of practicing based on the qualities of awakening itself

292
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:11,440
and that's about in some ways is available for everyone well before become liberated and in fact

293
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,680
that's often what dharma teachers are trying to do is to say practice with non-reactively

294
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:24,240
non-reactive awareness practice non-judgmental awareness practice open

295
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:30,480
awareness or um and that you know what they're doing is really trying to get these qualities of

296
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,920
awakening already there and so with they we grow into it and it grows and

297
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:42,319
develops and comes to fulfillment and finally

298
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:52,720
don't worry so much about this path of practice the only thing to

299
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,839
be concerned about and happy about exactly where you are

300
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:04,400
in your practice that's the place where practice in the dharma unfolds be

301
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,920
content and and happy and discover awareness

302
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,559
of where you're at not where you think you should be so thank you and we'll have one more

303
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,838
talk tomorrow on this topic and

304
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:27,839
and maybe for this next day you can look around and see if you've been

305
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:36,000
overlooking things like silence stillness spaciousness or independence freedom

306
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:47,599
cessation endings see if you can be nourished by that and supported by it thank you
