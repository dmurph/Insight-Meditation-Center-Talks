1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,600
so hello and welcome and uh to our Friday

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,639
meditation and uh we'll follow this with uh the short Dharma talk and then a

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,240
community meeting for those of you who would like to be part of it and we'll switch over to

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,480
zoom and uh the zoom uh link will be posted here at some point maybe at the

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,560
end at 7:45 I'll make sure it gets posted so you can uh get over there and

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,960
um I'll say more about it later but

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,600
welcome and uh one of the very rich and

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:50,680
important uh kind of interactions or richness of

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:57,480
the P practice is the uh mutuality the

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:05,158
association the inseparability of the experience we

11
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:14,159
have and the knowing of the experience and uh and or the seeing of

12
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,759
the experience and these two don't really exist so

13
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,960
separate and together uh see seeing them

14
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:33,399
working together is one means to become free from it all not get entangled not

15
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:39,560
get reactive to what's being experienced to what's being

16
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:47,079
known sometimes we emphasize knowing seeing sometimes we emphasize

17
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:54,680
experiencing sensing feeling the What's Happening Here and Now and so for this meditation you might

18
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,719
want to consider that the purpose of knowing

19
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,280
is to help us experience more clearly to feel what's happening more

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:13,040
clearly and the purpose of experiencing something clearly is to know it better

21
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,480
until at some point these two don't really become two different things uh it becomes very very

22
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,560
simple and you can almost hyphenate knowing experiencing or

23
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,640
experiencing knowing and um but but the important

24
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:39,000
point is that uh we're here to really be present in our present moment

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,440
experience and one of the ways to become wise in meditation is to become wise

26
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,560
about how we get separated from present moment experience either because we get

27
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,480
distracted caught up in thoughts or because we're making commentary and

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:04,680
stories around what's happening and excessive thinking about what's happening is a pulling away a

29
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,799
separation sometimes so much so that we lose touch with what's happening because the stories or judgments we make about

30
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,959
about it so

31
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,080
um purpose of experiencing in the present moment is to know the purpose to

32
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,480
know what's happening at present moment is to experience it and perhaps in some

33
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,599
relaxed easy way way this will help you stay present today it just kind of kind

34
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:40,920
of flow back and forth between experiencing what's here and now and in

35
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,439
the simplest way doesn't have to be 100% accurate um knowing what's Happening

36
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,920
Here and Now and just kind of flow back and forth stay there maybe in the gentle

37
00:03:51,920 --> 00:04:00,319
relaxing Rhythm so assuming a meditation posture

38
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:08,560
and gently closing your eyes and with your eyes

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,919
closed in your meditation posture globally experience what it's

40
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:26,720
like to be in this body in this posture globally recognize how it

41
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,440
is and in knowing allow yourself to experience what is

42
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:41,360
knowing more fully experience it through the

43
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,479
body almost like you're letting the body have its own experience of

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,600
itself and then to

45
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,440
know see that experience where the

46
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:16,560
knowing is not entangled is not reactive The Knowing is has a radical

47
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,840
Simplicity to it almost as if the knowing

48
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,440
itself is free of what it knows

49
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,360
some people like the idea of it's like looking in a mirror and you know what's in the

50
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,120
mirror but the image of the mirror is not something that

51
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,719
you do anything more than to

52
00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:00,120
know and then within the experience of the body

53
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:07,000
there's the experience of breathing and to experience the body how

54
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,080
the body experiences breathing feel and sense the body

55
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:25,120
breathing how breathing in is experienced differently than breathing out

56
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,599
sometimes that experience of the body experience of breathing comes along

57
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:43,319
with experiencing how we are more broadly

58
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:51,000
emotionally and that's fine let let the breathing let the body hold it

59
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,680
all breathe with it all let the breathing be part of the broader

60
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,520
experience of being alive

61
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:09,919
and then as you feel and sense the body your being

62
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:16,560
breathe know the breathing know it

63
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:25,319
simply lightly almost as if every moment of

64
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,319
knowing evaporates

65
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:40,960
as the knowing is

66
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,639
complete knowing and experiencing

67
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:10,918
seeing and feeling both part of present moment

68
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:20,000
experience trust the

69
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,400
knowing trust the experiencing you don't have to trust the

70
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:33,599
experience or what you know but you can trust the act of

71
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,560
experiencing the act of knowing when it's

72
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,719
simple nonreactive non-entangled

73
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,200
in the flow of Here and

74
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Now

75
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

76
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

77
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
for

78
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
for

79
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

80
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

81
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
e for

82
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
for for

83
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

84
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

85
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

86
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

87
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

88
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,799
e e

89
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:50,440
sometimes experience IND directly is the way to be in the

90
00:18:50,440 --> 00:19:00,360
present it's an anchor provide stability here now

91
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:07,080
sometimes knowing the experience is what is the anchor to Here

92
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,360
and

93
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Now

94
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

95
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

96
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

97
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

98
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

99
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

100
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

101
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,480
for e

102
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,760
and then as we come to the end of this

103
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:30,080
sitting one way of having a sense of or to feel or

104
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:37,880
to be inspired around the possibility of

105
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,480
Freedom through this

106
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,360
practice is to let your eyes whether they're closed or

107
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:56,080
open have a soft gaze where the eyes eyeballs kind of

108
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:03,159
float in the eye sockets not staring at anything fixated on

109
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:06,799
anything gently

110
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:13,279
floating

111
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,480
gently moving floating this way and

112
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,960
that just loose and Light

113
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:37,720
a gaze that is free of fear free of

114
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:45,880
Desire free of confusion just gently looking kind of like maybe just

115
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:52,000
looking at a mountain far in the distance appreciating it but not staring

116
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,039
and maybe gently kind of the eyes roam over the edges of the mountain the

117
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:08,559
details or looking at a tree gently swaying in the wind and the

118
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:16,240
eyes are relaxed and it is soft sometimes this kind of looking is

119
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,320
very relaxing for the whole body for the

120
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,799
mind that's why looking at the waves on the beach or the water flowing in a

121
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:35,480
river or even sometimes sitting around a campfire watching the

122
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:44,159
fire and imagine that you go into your life your

123
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,960
day to be with the things of the day the people of the

124
00:26:49,960 --> 00:27:00,240
day with this kind of seeing with a soft gaze relaxed gaze

125
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:09,320
maybe a sparkling gaze just from the Delight of being at ease and

126
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:18,120
relaxed it just feels good to see the others to see the world this

127
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:33,240
way and if the Gaze is not relaxed soft floating in the eye

128
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:42,519
sockets why is that what have you been caught by what emotions what concerns

129
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:49,760
what attitudes desires have kicked

130
00:27:51,080 --> 00:28:00,120
in that fixates the eyes so you stare at what's happening

131
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,200
and imagine that you can come back to a soft relaxed

132
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,200
gaze that gaze which represents not being caught by what's

133
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,799
happening but present to see

134
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:31,240
it and in this way we are we allowing others to be

135
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:39,200
free of how we do get caught how we react and it's a gift to

136
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,360
others maybe it supports them to relax and be at ease as

137
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:53,039
well may it be that this practice we do helps set others at ease helps others

138
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,519
feel safe helps others

139
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:06,640
feel seen without imposed on May it give people space and room to

140
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,880
be who they are free of our expectations and

141
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:20,720
needs may this practice that we do help us to help others in this

142
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,200
difficult world may all beings be

143
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:35,080
happy may all beings be safe may all beings be

144
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:40,960
peaceful may all beings be free

145
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:55,730
[Music]

146
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,000
thank you

147
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:55,360
so hello everyone and welcome to this last talk on the five qualities of the

148
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:02,279
Dharma and uh one of the things that Delights me is how I think

149
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:07,559
each day as I think about teaching about one of the

150
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:14,360
qualities it becomes my favorite of the qualities and um and so today the

151
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:20,320
quality of the Dharma is that it's characteristic of the Dharma the teachings of the Buddha is that they are

152
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,919
to be personally experienced by the wise now these five characteristics

153
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,399
reinforce themselves overlap May sometimes saying almost the same thing

154
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:36,559
and I like this because it's really emphasizing that this is something to be

155
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:43,200
personally experienced um the Buddha is only pointing to

156
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,720
something and that we have to see no experience for ourselves and there and that what we

157
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:55,360
pointing to is uh visible Here and Now something to

158
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:03,960
be seen and uh which is again we see in the present moment it's immediate it's it's

159
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:12,600
that kind of relationship to the present moment it's it's immediately here and it's

160
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:18,840
um uh it's invite the teachings are inviting us to take a good look for

161
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:26,200
ourselves because it is something to know for ourselves come and look come and see it's uh onward leading there's

162
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,240
something about the way that uh the teachings the practice the seeing that

163
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:38,240
we do uh doesn't it's not static doesn't leave us unchanged it set in motion a

164
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:45,279
maturation a movement an opening a healing growing and different times different

165
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:52,120
ones of those words relevant to be personally experienced by the wise and I kind of find find

166
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:58,960
delightful it's that it says to be experienced by the wise because uh

167
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:07,320
this is uh directed to all of us to all of you that you're being related to as a

168
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:16,320
wise person and um respected for that and um and I think that uh part of

169
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,720
that wisdom is that uh you are having the wisdom to understand that this is

170
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,960
something for you to go through yourself something for you to discover for

171
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,559
yourself and to know for yourself to be rooted in for yourself to no one else

172
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:39,360
can um can uh free you except for your

173
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:46,799
own practice and your own experience and that that's where the most profound and important freedom is found is here in

174
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,519
our own experience that we have to be present for and

175
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:58,919
um and so uh along that way there's a lot of small freedoms that that that we

176
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:04,159
discover and this freedom of staying close to our experience staying close to

177
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:13,200
what we can directly know frees us from all the fantasies all the memories all

178
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:19,398
the associations all the fears all the projections into the future ideas we

179
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:25,320
have that it very easily take us away into an abstract World help us to

180
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:32,440
separate and disconnect from something and the more disconnected we are from our direct experience the less our

181
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:41,638
direct experience of being a human being the direct feeling sensing seeing knowing can uh has room to unfold to

182
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:49,079
grow plus it has space to expand so uh we start becoming Freer of

183
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:54,398
all those abstractions Freer from all those being caught in thoughts and ideas

184
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:02,200
and memories and Fantasies and that's a phenomenal freedom on the way to full

185
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:11,359
Freedom so uh to be personally experienced by the wise and um the um the word for

186
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:19,200
experience uh in ply can also mean to know it could also mean to feel or to

187
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,400
sense and these different while we have different words in English that can be

188
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:32,040
know feel experience sense um there's no sharp strong separation of

189
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:38,880
that uh as the practice goes deeper and deeper as the mind gets more concentrated and still and more fully in

190
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:46,720
the moment here with the experience it's a begins to become a rich and very simple world where knowing and

191
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,200
experience is not that separate knowing and sensing is not so separate and uh

192
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,920
and and and freedom and knowing the Freedom

193
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,560
sensing and knowing Freedom sensing start becoming intimately Associated

194
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:11,480
intimately part of the same thing so these five qualities of the

195
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:17,640
Dharma the five qualities of the teaching when Dharma means teaching so

196
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:23,079
it's a litmus test for if you hear Dharma teachings that uh are these the

197
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:30,040
teachings of the Buddha the essential teachings of the Dharma are they something you for you to see yourself

198
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:38,400
are they something that's visible Here and Now is it immediate something you can experience right here so and right

199
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,520
now right immediate and is it something that uh is inviting you to take a look

200
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:52,640
for yourself or is Teachers kind of imposing their beliefs on you and um and is it onward leading does

201
00:36:52,640 --> 00:37:00,319
it lead to something useful does it lead to what's wholesome does it lead to what's beneficial for you does a lead to

202
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:06,560
Freedom so that's when Dharma means teaching sometimes Dharma also means the

203
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:13,000
the natural law or the natural processes that get set in motion as we practice

204
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:22,200
mindfulness as we do this meditation practice as we kind of engage in Buddhist practice and um and there also

205
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:29,079
uh we're starting to notice what's happening within us and uh how is this unfolding thing and what do we it's

206
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:35,480
right here in our experience that we discover the Dharma here that the Dharma

207
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:43,079
unfolds in our experience our felt experience our knowing our sensing are

208
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:48,760
really staying present here so one of the great gifts that this

209
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:55,720
mindfulness practice has brought me and I think other people as well is a

210
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:04,400
phenomenal Trust the great trust in the efficacy the value The Joy the the

211
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:13,480
richness of uh the mindfulness practice itself uh that I trust deeply being

212
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:21,119
mindful I trust deeply knowing what's happening in the experience I trust deeply

213
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:29,040
experiencing what what's I'm experiencing and um so the is here is

214
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,160
not the experience itself the event itself that's happening but rather

215
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:41,040
whether it's in myself or in the world but rather that I not necessarily trust

216
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:49,280
what I trust is uh bringing a clear attention to that to know it clearly to

217
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:57,040
feel it to sense it to be mindful of it that uh that I trust and so many

218
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,520
situations in my my life I have not known what to do and I've been confused

219
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,720
even by it sometimes but I've learned that I don't have to know what to do I

220
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:15,040
just have to show up I have to be present and see and sometimes in a complicated social situation it can be

221
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:22,040
helpful in a wise way careful way to name out loud um the what we're

222
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:27,079
experiencing what what what we're knowing kind of mindfulness out loud and

223
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:32,160
hopefully we've learned how not to uh how to make keep it really simple

224
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,000
and just the events without any judgments or criticism or um or

225
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:45,119
something that's more than just kind of the Simplicity of the moment but to name it and I've been in Social situation

226
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,440
which You're simply naming wow uh you know this is a tense uh conversation

227
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,720
we're having or uh this is um I'm feeling uncomfortable that that that

228
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:03,160
begins to shift the Dynamics and other people then shift and change and we're not locked into the conflict or the

229
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:09,359
tension that we have so this the point being trusting

230
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,880
not the experience but trusting the mindfulness of it the knowing of it the

231
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,079
clear present moment knowing it allows something different to unfold and when I

232
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,880
haven't known what to do I the situation unfolds and almost inevitably uh the

233
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:36,599
things move in a Direction that's beneficial and eventually sometimes have um have um revealed what is to be

234
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:42,119
known so I hope that these um five qualities characteristics of the Dharma

235
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:48,599
have been inspiring for you interesting for you useful for you and now in a few

236
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:55,880

for for

252
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,359
is

253
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:15,599
okay let's see can you hear me on uh on Zoom fantastic and I trust that those of

254
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:22,720
you who might have stayed on YouTube can hear me as well and um so this is very

255
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:29,280
nice to be together and it's been a long time since we've done one of these oh wait a minute I think that uh I should

256
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,599
be on a different oh what happened somehow the mic the audio went

257
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:40,440
off but also I should be on a different um

258
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:49,838
oh let me see wait one moment while I adjust the

259
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:28,920
okay

260
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:44,760
okay there I think face

261
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,599
so I think that

262
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,640
um I see what's Happ happening okay so I think that now I'm on the camera on the

263
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,800
wall so I can look at you more directly rather than looking down at

264
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:12,160
my so has to be on so I think that

265
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,680
technology is now set up can you hear me okay again

266
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:24,720
wonderful and uh so um so

267
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:30,640
hello and uh so it's been a while since we've had one

268
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:38,880
of these meetings and maybe some of you have questions you'd like to ask there's a lot of you that are here and uh maybe

269
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:45,359
we could do a few minutes of questions it helps me warm up a little bit um not quite sure what to

270
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:51,680
say and uh and then uh maybe we'll do a little uh breakout group so you can meet

271
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:57,640
each other a little bit and have a little discussion and come back and have some more discussion as a whole

272
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:06,000
group and uh so it' be best if you raise your Zoom hand if you know how to do that it's uh and um and if you don't

273
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,640
know how to do it uh there's a um uh place down below where I think it's uh

274
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:18,800
under uh my my computer it's uh under react so this is where you're allowed to

275
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,720
react As You Wish almost by raising your hand down there there's a there's

276
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,760
um so uh

277
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,720
Barb so Barbara you're muted are you able to unmute

278
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000

281
00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:12,680

282
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:20,280
though you're not managing to unmute oh oh hang on a can you wait a minute uh

283
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:28,720
because uh my uh technology thing is still not just right I have to um

284
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,359
I have to

285
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:50,720
uh there so because I'm I'm leaving this on

286
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:57,280
YouTube for the people who want to participate from YouTube I um

287
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:04,160
I I was hearing myself speak twice and so that uh didn't work so now I I muted

288
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:12,280
the YouTube channel so now Barbara I'm sorry so oh now you're muted again let's

289
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,599
see there you hear me now yes okay I'm

290
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:24,599
not getting the visual but let me just quickly do my question and I can hear you so that'll be good enough um the

291
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:33,079
first two characteristics of here and now and then immediate um

292
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:40,400
the um immedi see I understand as having something to do with um you know

293
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:47,720
relevancy in the past and relevant now and I also see it as immediate here and

294
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:54,920
now but I'm not really clear about how those two were different um so if you

295
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:00,160
just talk about that a little that might be helpful for me thank you yeah the the

296
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:07,160
PO for uh the first is di which means to view to be SE to be

297
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:14,359
seen and uh and and it also kind of means uh in in context it also can mean

298
00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:19,520
here and now in our live direct experience here and now but literally

299
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,920
means to see and so there's a common custom to translate it as to be visible

300
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:30,400
here and now but the now part is not needed because that that's coming

301
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,799
next and so it's visible here maybe is a better translation and then the next one

302
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:42,240
immediate is the now thank

303
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:46,359
you so then uh

304
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:57,280
Padma let's see uhuh thank you um my question is

305
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:04,079
um in any of the practice uh the ways of practicing you

306
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:09,880
know this morning you just talked about knowing and experiencing or you know of course

307
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:16,799
watching the mind or you know the breathing feel the body all those things

308
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:21,839
yes they do work for me but I still feel there is mind involved knowing an

309
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:27,160
experience for example right I wonder what you have to say about that I feel

310
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:32,200
like in in in in all the meditations there is still mind involved oh

311
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:38,079
absolutely yeah the mind is involved all of who we are is involved and uh and the

312
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:46,359
mind shouldn't be disrespected or it shouldn't be overvalued either but it has an important role and for the for

313
00:52:46,359 --> 00:52:51,400
vasna classic Vasa practice as mindfulness gets stronger and stronger

314
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:56,880
uh we start seeing more and more distinctions and the are are ordinary

315
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:04,040
life for many people everything's just a big buzz of chaos so just everything's kind of jumbled together in one big

316
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:09,079
experience as um mindfulness gets stronger and stronger and we get more

317
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:15,839
and more settled uh each individual physical and psychological mental

318
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:22,280
emotional event that occurs uh is seen distinctly rather than a bundle alog

319
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,520
together and so one of the things that we start seeing for example is that or

320
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:33,799
uh is that um uh you might feel a warm on your

321
00:53:33,799 --> 00:53:42,319
skin and but that distinct from that sensation is the mind has a a cognition

322
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:48,079
warmth warmth on skin and that is seen is very distinct from each

323
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:53,720
other uh rather than one and the same thing and how that's valuable is that

324
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:59,200
sometimes we don't distinguish between uh our our preferences our desires and

325
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:05,880
the experience so if I see it all as a bundle then uh having a warm skin uh

326
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:14,760
maybe I don't like it today because it's going to be hot day and so the not liking and the warmth are kind of wetted

327
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:20,480
together and so you know then in order to satisfy my preference I have to get

328
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,559
rid of the warmth but if you can see that uh that

329
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:30,839
the that the warmth and the preference the warmth and desire are two very

330
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:37,720
distinct events then you don't have to get rid of the warmth you have to kind of become Freer of the desire and the

331
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:42,760
desire is more the the mental activity so we start seeing the we start seeing

332
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:50,920
more and more distinctions uh uh and uh that's part of where the freedom comes in the Dharma is

333
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:56,440
uh seeing each individual event distinct from itself rather than somehow blend it

334
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:01,480
together with everything else does that make

335
00:55:02,839 --> 00:55:08,880
sense now you're muted again I think let's

336
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:14,559
see yeah I don't somehow I don't hear you yeah yeah yeah okay um yes it does

337
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:20,079
make sense um but I still get confused with the you know awareness and the

338
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:27,839
nonself um but I won't take too much time yeah yeah but that's easy to get confused with but uh the non we don't

339
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:34,640
say non-self in in our tradition we say not self and there's a very important distinction between there's no self

340
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:41,400
versus The Experience we're having is not self in our tradition we're not making a universal claim that there is

341
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,480
no self we're just as seeing for ourselves that every individual as we

342
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:52,000
see the distinct these very distinct experiences we tease things apart and see things

343
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,880
individually then um then uh we see that oh this is not

344
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:04,359
self this is not self this is not self it's always something very particular um and we don't get involved

345
00:56:04,359 --> 00:56:09,640
in the abstractions of what a self is just a particular and it's as clear as

346
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:16,200
if you uh cut your fingernail and the fingernail clipping is on the counter

347
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:23,440
and you don't say you'll say well that's not me you know that you know it's was me it was part of me but it's not me now

348
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:30,559
you don't identify that's that's the self so it's that clear

349
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:36,720
thank so is

350
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,680
AA hi there everybody um thank you Gil can you hear me okay

351
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:57,000
yes okay good um I I guess maybe my issue is s no self

352
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:05,119
I found myself in a meeting the other day um and feeling all these this

353
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:11,119
hostility coming up towards other participants and and then I had a lot of

354
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:19,720
Shame coming up fulfilling the hostility and I was with with

355
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:25,559
it but I felt like I was like immobilized I was not able to

356
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:30,799
participate in a really helpful um healthy

357
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:37,760
way because of these entanglements with a

358
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,240
personality thoughts and and struggles

359
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:49,680
and I even though I I want to be present and feeling it it was not very helpful

360
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:58,000
to just feel angry and hostile and wanting to like critical of other

361
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,039
people and I I'm kind of don't know what to do with

362
00:58:04,039 --> 00:58:10,520
that I think uh what I'd recommend you do with it is Be Inspired that you saw

363
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:16,400
it so clearly you see the issue so clearly and rather than feel like you

364
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:21,920
have to learn a skill or learn a technique or a secret for how to do better in the next

365
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:28,480
meeting I uh let it inspire you to develop your mind fness practice uh on

366
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:35,760
the on your you know as you in meditation in daily life and um and start start with small areas small

367
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:41,200
places where you're reacted to things and see see it in Easy places where you

368
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:49,400
can step back and just know it maybe without shame or have shame and not have it interfere and just begin slowly

369
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:56,599
building your uh your your strength of your practice and the day will come when

370
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:03,160
it your practice is going to be strong enough that you're at a meeting like this and you won't be tripped

371
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:10,760
up but you have to do you have to do the groundwork which is regular ongoing practice and you you'll find a way

372
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:16,039
you'll definitely you're you're in a good good position to develop yourself

373
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:22,280
grow in the Dharma in such a way that you'll find your freedom in these kinds of

374
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:27,440
meetings so this is not helping you with the meetings but it's it's uh offering

375
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:33,559
you a wise longer term uh

376
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:41,240
solution would I would it be a benefit to look deeper into the shame and

377
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:46,480
hostility absolutely it's useful to do that and sometimes you can do it on your

378
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:53,280
own sometimes you can journal sometimes you can go to therapy to look at it so that could be very useful but I would

379
00:59:53,280 --> 01:00:00,520
still like to emphasize for you um to uh um you know give your give

380
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:07,319
yourself over to the to doing the practice to build the practice to strengthen yourself through the practice

381
01:00:07,319 --> 01:00:12,799
and uh and that's a whole different route that's very important as well create the very strong practice

382
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:22,440
Foundation by developing your mindfulness so meditate every day maybe a couple of times a day maybe um you uh

383
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:28,119
find ways to develop stronger mindfulness in DayDay life maybe times you're alone at first when you're doing

384
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:34,319
Simple household chores or or going for a walk or driving and rather than uh

385
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:40,039
being distracted from yourself or caught up in things learn how in small ways to

386
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:46,200
let go of being caught let go of being caught and be present inste instead and slowly you'll

387
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:51,480
develop the strength that will be phenomenally helpful and and uh and it

388
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:56,760
might not help 100% depending on the strengths of the shame and the issues around it

389
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:03,440
um but if you do do therapy for example therap generally the par therapists I know they love it when people have

390
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:08,880
developed mindfulness practice they say it's so much easier to work with

391
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:16,599
them thank you thank you uh Jade maybe we'll take Jade and then uh Barb and

392
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:21,359
then we'll uh we'll do a break breakout

393
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,920
group so

394
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:35,480
hi hi thank you nice to meet you um long

395
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:42,160
time listener first time caller uh this might piggyback well on the previous

396
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:47,640
meditators um experience but I've been doing a Eightfold Path program and I

397
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:55,119
feel like I I really marinate in the teachings around the hindrances and I really struggle in um

398
01:01:55,119 --> 01:02:00,520
friendship and less in the spiritual sa but more in

399
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:08,400
Social world and knowing that um as adults we need friends and that coming

400
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:14,279
out of uh the many years of more isolation I find myself struggling and

401
01:02:14,279 --> 01:02:20,079
bouncing around the hindrances quite a bit so I was wondering if you had any

402
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:25,279
advice um in relationship to the hindrances and adult friendships making

403
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:33,720
them transforming with them into them out of them and um being at ease in that World

404
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:40,400
um from these teachings yeah I do have a little book called unhindered which talks about the

405
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:47,440
hindrances and the pra practicing with them and it might be interesting if you haven't seen it to look at that and

406
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:55,000
um and maybe uh practicing with hindrances with friends might be uh too

407
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:00,200
difficult to do live in lifetime when it's you're actually with friends but

408
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:09,079
maybe there's ways of uh reflection and remembering and and um and uh and uh

409
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:15,119
kind of um understanding uh inter interactions with

410
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:22,039
friends afterwards that you can slowly begin to learn about yourself and how you react

411
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:28,880
and when you react the most and what are the conditions for you to maybe not be so wise in in friendships

412
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:34,359
and what are the conditions that support you to be wise and how can you put those conditions in place before you're with

413
01:03:34,359 --> 01:03:39,599
friends so there's a way of kind of maybe outside of the the interactions

414
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:44,960
begin reflecting and thinking about uh what you can learn about yourself through

415
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:51,279
those the other is to um maybe begin uh it's important very important for human

416
01:03:51,279 --> 01:03:56,680
beings to have other human contact uh and uh maybe friendships is

417
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:03,279
too high a bar sometimes and volunteering somewhere where you don't have to be friends with people but

418
01:04:03,279 --> 01:04:08,799
you're volun volunteering with other good natured good willed people and uh

419
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:15,359
and having much lighter interactions with people and allows you to experiment a little bit uh how do you talk how do

420
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:21,920
you ask about ask people about themselves how do you uh you know uh

421
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:28,240
offer friendly words to people who are not going to be your friends but just to kind of what do you learn about how to

422
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:35,160
be together with people and what do you learn about your fears or your worries your concerns uh in situations that feel

423
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:41,319
much safer and uh not there's not so much at stake um so volunteering for

424
01:04:41,319 --> 01:04:48,279
example and uh and volunteering might provide you with enough uh social contact that you're beginning to

425
01:04:48,279 --> 01:04:53,319
exercise that part of your being so those are some of the and then there

426
01:04:53,319 --> 01:04:59,400
some of things in your question specifically about the Hind ances and friendships um again I think that

427
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:06,799
relates back to I said to maybe reflect after the the the uh uh a friend

428
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:13,240
encounter about your for yourself which hindrances came into play for you and what can you learn about yourself and

429
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:19,920
what can how can you be better prepared in the future and how can you maybe uh next time work with the hindrance as it

430
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:25,359
arises um how can you be on the lookout for them more and even as we get more

431
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:33,880
and more skilled about the hindrances we can um see them coming and we can some do a

432
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:39,520
course correction before they actually arise and so this is phenomenally

433
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:45,200
important the hindrances in some ways um it's one way of understanding uh

434
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:52,799
Buddhist practice it's primarily a practice of understanding the hindrances so if you feel like it's a

435
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:57,880
you know unfortunate that you have to work with the hindrances you don't have to think that way it's actually at the

436
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:04,440
heart of what we're working with

437
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:09,359
okay do that uh answer well enough for

438
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:18,160
now so maybe you're still muted so we'll go on to uh

439
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:24,880
Barb and then we'll do a breakout group and then I see another person raised her hand Mima so we can maybe do that after

440
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:31,760
the breakout group so Barb yeah good morning Gil thank you um

441
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:37,480
I'm pretty new to this group and my question comes from or an observation

442
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:43,359
maybe it's a question um belonging to another group for a long time and having

443
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:51,599
that leader be very charismatic and he has recently passed and the group

444
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:56,760
um how do they explain it there there's um

445
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:02,160
I think there's a lack in the group of people recognizing their own leadership

446
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:10,559
or their own value it's Val it has to do with value in their own wisdom and so I liked this morning how

447
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:17,359
you brought up it's getting to know it's the experience it's our experience for ourselves right that was one of the

448
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:23,880
teachings that I heard anyway this morning so if you can just say maybe a little bit more I don't know it's kind

449
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:30,240
of a question but I love like that aspect because it's hard because there's a part of me for instance that is just

450
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:38,319
meeting you for the first time this morning and then it's like okay and he's a teacher and then and you're

451
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:46,200
human anyway do you understand my question yes yes great great making any sense sense that makes sense to me I've

452
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:53,680
I've known a number of spiritual groups where people where that with the leader died or left or something and

453
01:07:53,680 --> 01:08:00,240
only then did people start to grow up only then they were ready to kind of own their own experience and look at

454
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:06,119
themselves deeply and be honest with themselves in the way they hadn't been before and so maybe if you're still

455
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:12,000
involved with that group uh maybe uh you can support yourself and others to begin

456
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,719
uh speaking up uh more honestly about and beginning to own your own experience

457
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:23,758
beginning to tap into your own wisdom rather than looking outside for it to someone else who's going to provide it

458
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:31,238
and maybe you're the leader you had did you a good service to prepare the ground for it and now you're ready the group is

459
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:37,758
ready to take take it to a whole different level where they're um you know ready to speak about their

460
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:44,040
experience and and learn from themselves so so and I and I feel on the

461
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:51,040
I've actually stepped away from this group probably five years ago so I'm kind of on the outskirts it well that

462
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:56,480
it's um it's a Val it's something about valuing too they're valuing doing our

463
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:04,040
the teacher within each of us yes does that make sense it makes a lot of sense and so what I uh so what I like to

464
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:10,000
comment hopefully it's okay that um that uh the fact that you are speaking up in

465
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:17,719
such a clear way here with your wish with what your your circumstances are and what you bring with you here um this

466
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:25,400
is a really good sign you're doing what's needs to happen Okay and maybe bringing that

467
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:30,798
stupid group yeah yeah okay and it's my

468
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:38,278
world great thank you Gil thank you so um let's do a breakout groups and uh I

469
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:44,600
think we can do groups of four and we'll do about 12 minutes and uh and the idea is just

470
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,798
introduce you introduce yourselves to each other and say maybe maybe some very

471
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:55,840
simple words about you know the value you've had from this uh being part of this YouTube

472
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:02,199
uh Community or teachings uh or something about some very something very simple about this

473
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:07,600
week's theme the idea is be very careful you don't spend a lot of time explaining

474
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,960
and talking uh think of it as a listening exercise primarily where

475
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:18,480
you're really going to because it's such a short time you don't want we don't want one person um going on and filling

476
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:24,360
the time for too long it's better if everyone is kind of brief in their comments and then you can come back to

477
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:31,840
you again and again and the value of brief is that and com coming back is that you will probably

478
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:38,800
change uh as you go along you'll learn new things you'll be ready to say something new that you never said before

479
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:47,040
um if you are brief and then wait for your turn again and see what comes out and see what comes out um but you know

480
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:53,159
it's supposed to be relaxed and more friendly and just a chance to say hello to each other mostly and so so please be

481
01:10:53,159 --> 01:10:58,480
relaxed and and friendly and so but it helps if some of you are if

482
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:06,440
you're not not going to be in the breakout group if you could uh check out of the zoom Now log out and you're

483
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:13,440
welcome to come and Jo come back in 10 minutes and uh I'll be here to receive you and um and that what that means is

484
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:19,120
that when we make the groups that um we don't end up with someone with alone in

485
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:27,880
a group because the other three people decided not to be there so if you could uh kind of log out out and then um and

486
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:33,760
then uh um we'll see when the numbers

487
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:41,719
stabilize and uh is it Julie or Nina which one of you are making the

488
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:47,960
groups I can make them great so so um so

489
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:54,400
if you could uh if you can not put me in a group I think that's maybe automatic I I

490
01:11:54,400 --> 01:12:01,280
don't know if it's set up for that but um uh and then um and then if

491
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:06,840
um and then set it for 12 minutes and when you're ready I think we

492
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:12,440
can probably do it now when if you're ready when you're

493
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:20,120
ready and then if Nina and Julie if if you guys don't end up in a group you're

494
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:27,560
welcome to go and and join one and um and I'll stay here in monitor

495
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:31,199
the the the the

496
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:49,480
site so okay so I think most of the groups

497
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:55,679
have been made so uh Julie do you want to join a group

498
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:01,199
um yeah I can yeah I'll join I I can just press join to anyone you can join

499
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:07,400
anyone especially if there's one that has three or something but uh whatever one you like you have you have a choice

500
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:12,639
and uh and Nina are you there would you like to join the group

501
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:19,880
or um I'm currently still trying to figure out how to time like start a timer oh then it then it's then it's

502
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:25,480
probably too late to do it now that happens before so uh so don't worry

503
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:32,080
about it uh it it probably it'll go on forever now is my guess and uh so let's

504
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:40,159
just let's uh uh I'll look at the clock and I'll close the rooms um I said I see

505
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:47,639
uh I think I can do that let me see um let's let so breakout

506
01:13:47,639 --> 01:13:53,159
rooms um the're groups of four in progress usually it says uh how long

507
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:59,040
they're supposed to be and and what you're supposed to do let me tell you can I want to tell you what to do you

508
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:06,600
normally oh yeah go ahead okay so when you make the groups you create them and then it shows

509
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:12,360
you that you know who's in which group and then but uh before you open it and

510
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:18,800
there's that uh settings uh wheel at the bottom left and you click on that and that will

511
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:26,199
show you how to set the timer and and then after you set the timer then you open the room

512
01:14:26,199 --> 01:14:31,600
okay because they're all gray out right now yeah yeah so it's fine it's fine so you can if you want to join then I I'll

513
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:36,679
I'll I'll I'll close the rooms uh in about you know 10 minutes or

514
01:14:36,679 --> 01:14:43,679

for helping oh yeah absolutely this is um

528
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:39,320
this is great did you have any trouble logging on in the beginning were you were you the one who opened the door the

529
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:46,920
room uh yeah I opened it and that that was that was easily enough yep no problems good because uh

530
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:53,400
yeah so I I had opened it earlier in the day to get the link and then I closed it but then this other laptop that I used

531
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:59,040
it said something funny about are you going to someone's logging on or it's logged on do you want to allow them to

532
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:04,239
log on or and I said what's that maybe it was you so I don't know why why it

533
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:09,800
came that way but so I'm glad it worked out I me yeah

534
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:16,040
no I mean I understand the security for the yeah for the account where do you

535
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:23,920
live where do you live Santa Clara oh so you're close yeah I guess compared to some of

536
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:29,000
the people here yeah yeah sometimes I think like oh I'm like

537
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:34,880
a little far you know it is like a like a 20 25 minute drive to repid city but

538
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:43,040
you know when people tell me like oh I'm in you know Minnesota or something I'm like oh [Laughter]

539
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:48,360
you're how long you've been uh involved with IMC or

540
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:55,520
IRC um I think just earlier this year is when I started coming around regularly

541
01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:01,520
nice do you have a background in this practice or this is your introduction um so I've done a couple

542
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:09,080
Retreats at Spirit Rock um I didn't have like a regular group or S

543
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:16,360
before and this is yeah I think like IMC is kind of the closest one around here

544
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:23,639
uhhuh so yeah that I joined to help me cultivate a more regular

545
01:20:23,639 --> 01:20:28,880
practice meet some people good and we we are going to start doing some events

546
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:35,520
slow slowly probably like a year to build up at Hidden Villa you know about Hidden Villa in Los Altos so that maybe

547
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:42,760
that's even closer for you yeah I was there for the for the um

548
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:48,920
volunteer meeting yeah so so and I don't know I don't know if the Friday the 16th

549

550
01:20:54,800 --> 01:21:01,679
oh um I think I might be busy that day uhhuh um I would have loved to join but

551
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:05,639
I'm sure there'll be more yeah yeah

552
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:17,120
yes and do you have a some kind of technical background that they're helping with the technology here or or

553
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:22,239
um what's your background

554
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:28,239
um so my work background is more in like office management and Logistics um but

555
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:34,880
my actually my current job is doing ab uh I work at the Stanford lab Ah that's

556
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:41,800
a huge job so so you you you help with some of the classes they make that videos and

557
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:47,199
things like that um I work more in the Live Events

558
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:54,719
so a lot of the times we'll have like a really big um meeting you know like people fly in and um I work in theice

559
01:21:54,719 --> 01:22:00,400
Auditorium I would say like 90 90% of the time and then some sometimes I

560
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:06,040
support in um the meeting rooms well I I can tell you hopefully

561
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:12,159
it's interesting story about the AV at Stanford that um my son went to Stanford

562
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:19,239
and um and um it wasn't until his last year

563
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:25,159
there that he learned how to pay attention in class

564
01:22:25,159 --> 01:22:31,560
because he would class the class lectures were so slow he was on his phone he was talking to his neighbors in

565
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:37,320
the class and you know he this guy likes to multitask and his attention span is

566
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:43,840
and he was doing fine he was getting straight A's and everything was fine for him but but he wasn't really paying attention in the class then he

567
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:49,000
discovered that all his classes were recorded and that if he listened to them

568
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:56,199
at three times speed then he could pay attention then it would then he was engaged and he said

569
01:22:56,199 --> 01:23:04,600
I learn so [Laughter]

570
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:11,679
much so um so anyway so at least there's one kid who found them extremely

571
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:19,280
valuable yeah no um when I was in college I actually I'm the opposite well

572
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:27,239
I'm the same way when I listen to like audiobooks I have to listen to them faster because read so slowly that I get

573
01:23:27,239 --> 01:23:32,800
really distracted but um when I was in school I couldn't watch recordings I

574
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:40,560
would get really bored um it was a lot easier for me to listen in person yeah

575
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:48,360
yeah so he he was too distracted in person [Laughter]

576
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:53,480
so so let's see maybe another minute and then I'll uh we can close you you want

577
01:23:53,480 --> 01:24:01,560
to be the one since you you opened it you want to be the one who closes it uh sure so so it just means you you

578
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:08,280
go open up the breakout room Tab and you see in the bottom right it says close all

579
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:15,679
rooms so uh I don't know how it's been set usually it's set that it takes 60 seconds to once it starts but sometimes

580
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:22,639
it just it's set for different let's see what it is so if you want to um push that red button and let's see what

581
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:28,400
happens all right let me just broadcast and let

582
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:35,840
them know that I'm closing them all right yeah 60 seconds 6 seconds

583
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:52,080
great right and now we wait for the Del

584
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:48,480
so I think people are back now and um I hope that was nice for you to have a

585
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:54,400
little chat and meet some of the people and some of the people maybe you've seen their names in the chat sometimes it's

586
01:25:54,400 --> 01:26:00,760
nice to you know you know see them in person on Zoom at

587
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:07,679
least and uh I think before we uh we went to the zoom rooms there Mimi I

588
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:14,920
think that was the name was the wanted toas a question and if if Mimi still here that you'd like to

589
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:23,480
ask yes go ahead if you have to un oh there you are good morning Gail thank

590
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:28,800
you for this experience um it just makes started off my day on the right note with u meeting different

591
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:34,639
people um my question is you're the first teacher I ever heard use the term

592
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:41,119
and I've experienced it but I was wondering if you could say a little bit more about it when we sense like we know

593
01:26:41,119 --> 01:26:46,520
but we sense and it I wonder if it ties in with uh pma's question is that still

594
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:54,280
part of the mind or what is because when I'm listening to somebody and I'm not quite understanding I get really

595
01:26:54,280 --> 01:27:01,600
concentrated or mindful of like trying to hear and all of a sudden I'm sensing it's like the mind is out of the way and

596
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:08,800
I'm able to like perceive what they're trying to convey great I love what you say I love what you're saying and this

597
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:16,480
speaks to the fact that the word sense in English has multiple meanings I primarily use the the word sense to mean

598
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:24,320
sensing Sensations but uh but sometimes it's used uh in a very important way to refer

599
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:30,600
to uh having more of an intuitive understanding of what's going on and uh

600
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:36,119
and I think that as we practice mindfulness and as we bring kind of a careful full attention non-reactive

601
01:27:36,119 --> 01:27:41,560
attention we have access to other ways of understanding than what is so

602
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:48,360
conscious the subconscious mind is very rich a lot goes on there there's a lot of information being taken in and being

603
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:54,960
processed that our for whatever reason our conscious mind may be is not tracking but if we real relax and open

604
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:00,000
up to this deeper way of knowing sometimes we can we can have this uh

605
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:07,639
intuitive sense of something and uh I trust that a lot I use it a lot but I

606
01:28:07,639 --> 01:28:12,760
don't trust it automatically if there's an intuitive sense I always double or

607
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:20,920
triple check is this really accurate is this right and I'll wait before I articulate it or act on it and sometimes

608
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:26,880
if it involves other people I'll even uh check with them first you know this is

609
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:32,480
my sense this is my intuition what is this is this okay is this right or and sometimes I don't use even use the word

610
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:38,639
sense because it confuses people uh or in intuition I say you know I have this

611
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:47,199
interpretation and that and that gives them lots of permission to see it as not being so you know so you know that it

612
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:54,719
doesn't carry the same weight so but I I love it that you have that and uh and maybe there's a way of

613
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:59,760
of uh becoming wiser and wiser about how you use that intuitive

614
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:04,800
sense well I think you help me a lot today um with that response because um I

615
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:12,080
always wonder what it was and as I practice more it gets sharper um I don't have to really do anything it just like

616
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:17,679
naturally comes up and so I wondered if it was related somehow so it does help

617
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:25,400
tremendously so thank you so much great thank you so then Jim
