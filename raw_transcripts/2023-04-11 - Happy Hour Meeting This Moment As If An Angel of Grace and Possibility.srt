26
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:55,980
transitioned from warming up the space and saying our hellos to each other um I changed some of the settings so

27
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:02,640
that unmuting will not be possible we keep the space quiet during the meditation

28
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:10,140
uh and also I change the settings so that um chats will only come to me but I ask

29
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:17,400
you to please don't send me chats when I'm teaching because they can be quite distracting I will open it up afterwards

we may not quite understand all the gifts all the grace that this Angel has

90
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:08,040
if the word Angel doesn't work for you try something else that works for you and Buddhism we have Devas which are the

91

167
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,720
it's not always the same and sometimes some practices work for you sometimes they don't sometimes you have to adapt

168
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:55,740
and adjust them it's all good and sometimes wow something opens up that hadn't been accessible before so you

169
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:01,320
know yeah yes this is my way in so the invitation to explore today after

170
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,599
we got settled as usually we do the breath and the body

171
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:12,720
was to explore this friend this this this moment of Our

172
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:19,200
Lives this moment of our lives right here as as a friend as a good friend or as an

173
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:26,220
angel because the idea of an angel for many people not for every has a sense of Grace a sense of goodness meeting the

174
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:31,440
unknown meeting the mystery being open to the mystery to the goodness then

175
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,740
there are few people for whom that doesn't work you can use good friend or Deva which again means angels in

176
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:44,820
Buddhism but there's a little different um but basically this idea of appreciating this the grace of this

177
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:51,359
moment opening up to it meeting you with kindness with Goodwill which is really good will

178
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:58,320
for ourselves so it's basically practicing meta and Goodwill for ourselves but in this indirect way

179
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,960
and also um appreciating that these angels this

180
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:12,000
this this these this grace of this moment is finite there's finitude so can that bring more

181
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:20,460
of an appreciation more grace of oh yes let me appreciate this moment of being alive not take it for granted

182
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:27,119
um but mostly turning with kindness with gentleness with with meta with Goodwill

183
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:33,780
can I meet this moment with good will no matter whether you know what whatever is arising maybe the angel is bringing

184
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:38,960
challenges for me to meet but there is Grace in that too

185
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,940
okay the rooms are closed everybody's back welcome back everyone

186
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:57,140
and it's nice to see some Smiles as you come back from connecting with one another and uh we have time for

187
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:02,640
Reflections questions comments aha moments challenges and

188

189
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:16,740
forward if you have spoken recently to pull back so that we we hear from a variety of

hi Nikki hi that was uh extraordinary thank you so

195
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:54,839
much uh the invitation the angel I imagined being with me was

196
00:37:54,839 --> 00:38:01,260
an angel of death and um you know I you said something about

197
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:07,640
the the angel you know having Beauty and possibilities that you didn't even know

198
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:16,099
and so that was my conception of the angel and I experienced really profound

199
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:21,540
gratitude and acceptance and forgiveness

200
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:26,820
