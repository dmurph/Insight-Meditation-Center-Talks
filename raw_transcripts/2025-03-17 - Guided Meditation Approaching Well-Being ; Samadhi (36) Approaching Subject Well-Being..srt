1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:09,800
so hello and welcome and as we now

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:17,520
approach entering into samadei to appreciate that there starts

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,240
to be a turning to be really here present as if

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,760
here is a home here is our nest in which to settle

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:37,480
into that here is a really good place to be and so to begin

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,399
today with assuming a meditation posture

7
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:50,000
And in this posture of meditation to

8
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,880
appreciate doing nothing for a few

9
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,439
moments in the doing nothing of being able to put

10
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:18,720
aside the agendas the things we feel we have to do even putting

11
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,239
aside doing meditation just doing nothing

12
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:38,160
doing nothing in the posture of meditation as if it's a homecoming here

13
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:51,840
now where meditation the posture is a nest that holds everything about

14
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:01,040
you what's wonderful and what's difficult it all has space just to

15
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:11,000
be in a situation where it doesn't have to do anything about it at

16
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,319
first so beginning a meditation is turning away from the

17
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:26,040
usual activity of doing of accomplishing getting away

18
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:44,959
And then gently taking a few deeper inhales and let the

19
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:55,720
exhale take care of itself let the exhale just release the body the tensions

20
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,560
where a deeper inhale is a kind of a

21
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:16,640
clear intention to be here

22
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,680
now and the exhale allows there to be a softening

23
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,440
relaxing here and

24
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,600
now and then to let your breathing return to normal

25
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,320
and the inhale can be

26
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,639
a opening awakening into the

27
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:16,280
body the breathing body and the exhale a softening a settling

28
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:46,320
the inhale can be a time to clear the

29
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:56,520
mind and the exhale a time to soften the tensions of the mind

30
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,520
breathing in breathing out

31
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,680
and to come into the approach stage of meditation of

32
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:46,680
samadei is to feel the call feel the

33
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:56,800
welcome into something that feels pleasant a sense of well-being

34
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,319
even if there's things about your experience now which is uncomfortable pain emotional pain

35
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,520
anything it's okay but to feel more

36
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:17,599
deeply in this meditation posture in the

37
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,280
settling is there a way to give yourself over

38
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:34,400
to the pleasant sensations of breathing wherever they might

39
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:42,479
occur however brief the pleasantness is the goodness of breathing the

40
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,280
relaxing of

41
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:56,160
breathing or a sense of well-being that's broad through the body maybe very

42
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,599
faint within which the experience of

43
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,080
breathing occurs

44
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:17,519
putting aside the usual way of thinking

45
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:25,440
about having sensual pleasures sensual desires

46
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:34,560
even in meditation for something that is

47
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:42,640
deeper a deeper sense of at homeness a deeper sense of

48
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:52,839
well-being maybe at the core of where you are

49
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,480
maybe it's associated with a certain

50
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,959
relief for these minutes to not be involved in the usual preoccupations

51
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:12,480
with any kind of sensual pleasure that the mind is able to put

52
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,040
those aside is

53
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:27,120
good in favor of turning towards a

54
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,680
depth of contentment a depth of wholeness a depth

55
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,760
of being nested here maybe at the grounding place the

56
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,959
settling place of

57
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:10,320
breathing staying close to the entire inhale the entire exhale

58
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:17,640
as if that is the thread that's keeping

59
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:25,399
you gently connecting to a deeper place that feels

60
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,440
wholesome good just being

61
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,160
here just being present

62
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:52,120
a wholesome sense of well-being that maybe spreads a sense of

63
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:59,560
health goodness throughout your body

64
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:15,519
as if the rhythm of breathing is the massage is the

65
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:22,600
kneading of the dough of meditation

66
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:49,759
there comes a time in meditation when rather than focusing on

67
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,640
thoughts instead Focusing on the thoughts that are about our

68
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:04,919
experience about things the focus

69
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:12,160
switches to the direct experience here in this

70
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:19,440
body as if awareness arises out of the

71
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:27,600
body arising with The inhale with the

72
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:40,559
exhale with a delight of having the mind no longer

73
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:46,000
centered on thoughts that are about

74
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,679
things that objectify

75
00:19:52,320 --> 00:20:00,799
I delight in being centered in the body with the subjective

76
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,799
experience

77
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,760
and as we come to the end of this

78
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:42,679
sitting to take a few moments to feel in your body and

79
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:49,440
mind any shift that's happened for you through the

80
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:59,320
meditation are you a little calmer more settled

81
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,440
are there any feelings of

82
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:17,279
well-being however subtle that are in your body now that

83
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,919
were not there

84
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,960
before do you feel if there's been a

85
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,640
reorientation from

86
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:45,320
preoccupation to being centered in your body

87
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:01,600
whatever beneficial change has happened over the

88
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:10,480
course of the sitting that shift is important and

89
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:19,000
valuable to recognize so that we can feel the

90
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,919
shifts that support entering samadei

91
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:35,039
and so we can appreciate how we are and how it might support us in going

92
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:40,080
into the world how would you stay close to the

93
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:47,279
sense of well-being with the ringing of the bell

94
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:54,440
to end the sitting listening to the little talk that I'll

95
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,960
give and getting up to begin your day or continue your

96
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:06,480
day with some reference point some reference to this shift that's happened

97
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:14,960
in meditation a shift in understanding or

98
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,120
orientation and may it be a shift

99
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,919
that heightens our care our

100
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:31,278
awareness of the well-being of

101
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:42,520
others may all beings be happy may all beings be

102
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:48,360
safe may all beings be peaceful

103
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,480
may all beings be

104
00:28:54,039 --> 00:29:01,880
free and may we have confidence that the people we encounter

105
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:09,640
today can in fact be happy safe

106
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:17,679
peaceful free at least in our presence with how we are

107
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,840
with them

108
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:34,270
[Music]

109
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,480
thank you

110
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:28,159
so welcome to this series on samadei and Today

111
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:36,799
uh also marks the maybe the 5year anniversary of beginning these uh YouTube mornings

112
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:42,799
together some of you have been along for the whole ride for five years and I'm

113
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:51,919
very grateful for all of you who come and and uh I have some confidence that

114
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:57,120
uh that the goodness of our time together

115
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:04,640
spreads from you into the world so this kind of network of of radi radiating

116
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:11,919
network of bringing good to the world is uh is a great thing to be part of and um

117
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:20,279
thank you for these five years so uh samadei this week we're going

118
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:27,360
to kind of cover the territory more of the approach called access concentration

119
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:33,919
usually in English but um uh the the stage of approach approaching somebody

120
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,760
and this is when uh it's relatively easy to stay in the present moment if we lose

121
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,320
the present moment it's almost like it's obvious it's easy to come back or there's a almost a

122
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:54,320
a call inside to come back be here and um and uh there starts to be a

123
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,399
shift of orientation where uh the orientation is

124
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:05,000
towards the goodness of meditation the joy the happiness the well-being of

125
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,480
meditation or of concentration of really staying present over the mind not

126
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,080
wandering not being scattered not being caught by other things

127
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:23,640
really be here and it's a kind of almost a little bit of a quantum shift like okay now we're here

128
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:29,440
um and uh and uh it is a a reorientation

129
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:36,159
of some kind and with that reorientation it becomes a a form of joy a form of

130
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:46,559
delight or this is good and um and uh so uh in the in the classic

131
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:55,039
teachings about going into samadei going into Janna's um there's the the penultimate activity

132
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:00,919
that is done is to learn to uh let go of the

133
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:06,960
hindrances and uh and these are the we've talked about this before but here

134
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,200
the five hindrances are very subtle they can be very big forces in the mind huge

135
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,519
and and that can be very destructive for people but in deeper meditation it's

136
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,720
that we're getting into the kind of the subtle subtlety of it how easy it is to

137
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,120
kind of be drift off into thoughts concerns of sensual pleasure easy is to

138
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:39,200
get involved with movements of um of aversion how easy it is to move into uh

139
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:45,360
getting kind of uh sloth and torper rigid and resistant the subtlest

140
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,640
versions of um restlessness and regrets

141
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:57,279
the subtlest versions of uh uncertainty like what am I doing here

142
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:04,159
and so uh and it's somehow settling those and appreciating the goodness the

143
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:10,800
rightness the pleasure the the well-being of not having the mind caught

144
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,839
in those kinds of concerns and I think of this as a switch a shift from

145
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:24,480
objectifying thoughts to a subjective feeling and what I mean by objectifying

146
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,398
thoughts is that to when we're caught in s desires for sensual desires sensual

147
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:37,280
pleasures they usually go with thoughts about the the experience of sensual

148
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,200
pleasure about the object of sensual pleasure same thing with aversion there's no aversion without something

149
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:49,040
we're averting pushing against wanting to go away and that involves engaging

150
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,480
the thinking mind where that whatever we have aversion for or desire for is now

151
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,880
an object of the thinking mind and to the we're not strong it

152
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:07,680
keeps us disconnected from ourselves there's an we're no longer present for the deeper subjective experience of

153
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,599
what's actually the feeling of being alive the vitality of being here

154
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,680
and so the shift and now it's really begin happening deeper and deeper in as

155
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:26,000
we approach is that we're no longer satisfied content to be objectifying to

156
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,640
be caught in thoughts that are about the world about desires about

157
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:38,920
diversions and so there's a shift to trusting or resting in the subjective

158
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,320
experience uh so and with the breathing for example

159
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:51,680
it's the deep subjective experience of the breathing that we linger with we stay with and uh to give a little sense

160
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,119
of what the subject experience is like how directly almost sematic it is it's

161
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,920
kind of like if you take two fing two fingers your thumb and your pointing finger and press them together

162
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,119
um you'll feel some some sensations maybe of pressure maybe heat maybe

163
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:16,240
firmness something there some s sensations are there those sensations you feel as you

164
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:22,000
press your fingers together uh occur together with sensing them if

165
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,960
we didn't have the capacity to sense to feel we wouldn't know that there was

166
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:35,000
pressure and and the sensing of the pressure or and

167
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,520
the uh the sensation of pressure are one and the same you can't really separate

168
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,440
them linguistically we can say there's a sensation is a thing out there that

169
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:54,079
we're aware of something that the sensation but uh but uh in order to

170
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:02,320
sense the sensations that's not out there that's in the fingers and and

171
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:11,640
so and so the sensing and the sensation together make up the subjective

172
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:17,040
experience now I can be objectifying it by saying I'm not having the right kind

173
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:24,320
of feeling of pressure there's a particular right way of doing this and I'm not quite getting what the sensation

174
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:33,200
is supposed to be it's supposed to be maybe harder or softer or more pointed or more spread out and um and and this

175
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:40,880
makes me think about you know I wonder why why is Gil doing this as an exercise it could be doing it with some really

176
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:48,640
pleasant delightful sensations of the body that would be the way to get my attention those thoughts are in the

177
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,680
objectifying world the subjective world here is the

178
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,599
place where sensing and sensations occur together and so with the breathing it's

179
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:06,520
those sensations of breathing that are known where this they are being

180
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:12,720
sensed where the awareness is the attention is and so to stay right there

181
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,880
in that subjective world of sensing and sensations and as we stay there the

182
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,400
subjective experience can grow because there's a goodness there's a sweetness

183
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,680
there's a well-being that can arise that is not the

184
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:38,000
well-being that comes from physical pleasure that we know if we you know sensual pleasure and so

185
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,320
there's a shift of orient orientation in the approach stage from being concerned

186
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:51,839
interested enamored with the objectifying thinking mind and and

187
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:58,760
instead feeling like we're at home in this is where it's good it feels delightful to be here in the subjective

188
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:05,760
experience where sensing and sensation occur together and uh and that subjective

189
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:15,800
experience can be quite broad through the body there could be a tingling a warmth a vibration a flow a opening a

190
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:21,839
lightness that happens even as we stay very close to the inhale and exhale

191
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:28,000
maybe counting them so really stay right there with them and um but the idea is

192
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,040
not to be in the control tower tightly focused but rather to

193
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:40,400
be relaxing into the subjective experience letting go into it trusting

194
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,599
it uh thinking of that subjective experience of breathing is kind of like

195
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:54,160
the nest the resting place the grounding place for our sense of being in our life

196
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,000
and so the Buddha talks about how as we make this shift from the hindrance of

197
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,160
sensual desire uh to this deeper subjective experience

198
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,760
just that feels good it can feel like a relief it can feel like um kind of a

199
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:19,839
happiness or contentment that now we know something that's more satisfying this is good and uh it's less exhausting

200
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:25,680
it's less tiring thought thinking about sensual desire is exhausting there's the

201
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:32,960
mind is kind of restless kind of forceful kind of agitated and um and uh

202
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,560
you sometimes with a contraction and tightness in the mind the resting in the

203
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:45,280
subjective experience allows the mind to soften to open the the the control tower

204
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,440
no longer has to work so much it can just settle back and allow for the

205
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:58,800
subjective experience to inform it to arrive to be there and um and it there

206
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,359
can be a great sense of well-being in the approach

207
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:10,720
stage of practice uh this is where you're allowed or encouraged to start

208
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:18,520
feeling the well-being that's there in meditation uh however subtle it is

209
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:25,839
to recognize it and and trust it allow it to be there there's something about

210
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:32,480
giving our attention giving awareness making room for what is wholesome that lets the

211
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,640
wholesome grow and the wholesome gives us a different subjective way of being

212
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,079
with everything in our life i know that our lives are difficult

213
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:50,400
i know that there's all kinds of difficult emotions sensations in the body that can that can happen but as we

214
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,680
get into this approach stage um we've learned how to be mindful of

215
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:03,839
them how to relate to these difficulties in a good way through mindfulness practice and it's okay to recognize them

216
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:09,599
allow them to be there on the edges it's it feels now it feels in this approach

217
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:16,319
stage it feels just right to open to the deeper feelings of well-being however

218
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:21,760
subtle they are and so the breathing into the sweetness breathing with the

219
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:28,400
beauty with the subtleness with the contentment this is the work of the

220
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,520
approach stage but maybe I shouldn't use the word work some people think of it as

221
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:41,280
play some People think of it as an act of love love making some people think of

222
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,960
it as uh nurturing and caring and um

223
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:54,240
um uh nourishing ourselves the the deeper experience of

224
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:01,040
this kind of joy sometimes is because of a word play in Pali um where pity in

225
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,359
Pali also means to drink we're we're in in invite we're drinking the goodness

226
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:15,359
we're drinking the wholesome so for today uh as part of this ability

227
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:21,760
to make a shift orientation I'd encourage you to um um

228
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:28,599
spend a day kind of look feeling the difference between the

229
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:37,119
objectifying world of thoughts especially thoughts of sensual desire whether it's food or sex or some other

230
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,319
pleasant wonderful experience that uh the objectifying that living the

231
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:48,800
thoughts of that versus deeply the subjective experience

232
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,200
the metaphor that I have for this is that uh a person can be on a hot day or

233
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:02,480
cold day sitting at the edge of a beautiful lake and um and thinking about you know

234
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,839
all kinds of sensual pleasures that would be wonderful to have daydreaming and wishing being angry for not having

235
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:13,680
them and and preoccupied by difficult it is to have this sensual desires and

236
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,440
right there in front of the person is this delightful lake pond on a hot day

237
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:26,560
it feels so refreshing to go into it on a cold day it's maybe hot hot pools it's

238
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,839
so good to go into it and as soon as we go into it what brings a tremendous

239
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:39,359
sense of ah relief joy happiness is the subjective experience and it's not just

240
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:44,560
simply the subjective experience of being on the wonderful water it's also

241
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:50,240
the subjective experience of putting to rest putting aside all those

242
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:57,560
objectifying thoughts on the control tower ah this is good so study

243
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:03,119
that and uh during the day the objectifying mind versus object

244
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:09,119
subjective mind and maybe you're can step into the lake uh more often through

245
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,760
the day than you realize thank you
