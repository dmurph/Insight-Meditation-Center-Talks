1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:08,559
hello everyone and it's good to be here and i hope that

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:14,080
it's good to be here there where you are

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,480
and um it is a day for celebrating the earth appreciating the

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,560
earth valuing it and um

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,520
sometimes uh you know in that today's topic for the meditation is

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,480
mindfulness of thinking i sometimes reflect on

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,399
imagine long before human beings appeared on the planet and started

8
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:55,920
naming things and dividing up the lands in different ways that there were no boundaries between

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,960
countries there were no countries with boundaries and no states with boundaries provinces

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,079
you know just no property lines in a sense the earth was seamless

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:18,159
in a sense uh just a con one one large continuity of sorts of the natural world

12
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,840
and that the divisions that we live under boundaries and all kinds they're the product of

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,000
thinking and what happens when we see it as such

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,360
really see the clarity that this is thinking these are thoughts that were

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,560
created and then live our life based on them

16
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,000
so thinking one of the

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,040
important instructions i received in meditation or in life when i was living at the zen

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,880
center's monastery tasahara i don't remember who told me this or

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,039
what the lineage of this particular teaching was it might have been originally from

20
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,959
suzuki roshi and that was that the instruction

21
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,400
to not be bothered by your thinking

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,280
and and that was really insightful i thought this don't be bothered by your thinking

23
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:35,120
and with that little piece of advice with time i learned that when i was bothered by my thinking

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,920
i was actually fueling my thinking that there's something about

25
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,879
the reactivity of being bothered being troubled by thinking that itself is kind of a food for more

26
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,239
thought or is itself a kind of agitated thinking and that

27
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:02,400
not to be bothered by thinking was a paradoxically actually a way to for the thinking to quiet down to

28
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,319
not be the fire of thinking too quiet and still

29
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,239
and um and i learned that uh not to be at war with thinking not to

30
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,000
try to get rid of thinking that thinking is a

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,120
fine thing to do it takes care of itself as long as i don't get

32
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,959
wrapped up in it or preoccupied with it troubled by it or attached to it

33
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,599
and so sitting in meditation is a means as a way to discover one of

34
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,440
the places to discover how to leave thoughts alone and

35
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,080
and not be entangled with them or not to live in them sometimes i had the sense

36
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,640
that when i you know get caught up in thoughts that

37
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,799
i'm actually taking up residency in my thinking it's kind of like the center of gravity that

38
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,959
i think therefore i am and uh and when i don't take up residency

39
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:21,120
there if i take up residency in my body or in an awareness that's maybe

40
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,040
free of thinking then things are so much easier and so much

41
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:34,960
more pleasant and freer an interesting question to ask

42
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,479
is to be to ask who are you

43
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,360
when you don't use thoughts to answer the question

44
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:59,759
who are you if you don't use thoughts to answer the question

45
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:10,720
and what happens to you what do you become aware of then that's not and doesn't involve thinking

46
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,800
doesn't involve labels ideas

47
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,960
explanations maybe doesn't involve the past and the future

48
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,400
because those come with thoughts and ideas and memories

49
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:40,479
so today we'll do a little guided instructions on thinking

50
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,600
and so one little further introduction to this topic

51
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:54,000
that the general generally thoughts whether they're

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,240
verbal thoughts or images that we see visual thoughts um there's usually

53
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:11,680
a content through the to them they're about something they're about

54
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,319
ourselves about someone else about the future about what happened what's going to happen about fantasy

55
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,720
there's a world of aboutness and the more we live in thinking the more we live in this world of

56
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,400
aboutness as opposed to living in the world that's more here and now

57
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,600
more direct and the task of mindfulness of thinking

58
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,080
is not to get away from thinking but to be

59
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,680
present for thinking in in ways that are in the parts of

60
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,960
thinking that are not the content of your thoughts

61
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,280
it's more like the process of thinking rather than what you're thinking how you're thinking

62
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,520
more than what how what the experience of thinking is

63
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,800
like instead of why you're thinking so i'll guide you with this

64
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:23,440
so entering into a stable alert

65
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:31,840
meditation posture

66
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:45,840
where there's a adequate stability that you can now relax into this posture

67
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,038
perhaps taking a few long slow in-breaths and out-breaths

68
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,840
relaxing on the exhale

69
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,000
and then letting your breathing return to normal

70
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:27,840
and then as you exhale relax the muscles of your face

71
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,280
around your eyes

72
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,839
cheeks in the jaws

73
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:55,839
as you exhale soften your shoulders release the holding that might be there

74
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,440
and you might also soften your belly

75
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,839
allowing the belly to hang forward and maybe down

76
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,839
and then as you exhale feeling the body's experience of

77
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
exhaling

78
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,560
maybe a global experience of breathing the different parts of the body that get

79
00:09:50,560 --> 00:10:05,839
activated with breathing in and breathing out

80
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:22,240
and on the exhale at the end of the exhale maybe there also there can be a relaxing

81
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:33,839
letting go releasing that allows the exhale to continue just a little longer

82
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:02,160
and continue this way for a longer doing this but as you relax through the exhale

83
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:10,000
see if you can let go of your thinking or if you can't let go of it

84
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,680
quiet your thinking a little bit

85
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:23,519
let go of your thoughts acquired your thoughts so there's more attention available

86
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,839
for the experience of exhaling

87
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:08,639
and now we'll do a shift in attention

88
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,000
and shifting the attention away from the breathing in a sense

89
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,519
and let the center of attention be a direct awareness of your

90
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,399
self-thinking for this exercise

91
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:34,560
you're allowed to think no need to let go of it

92
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:44,880
but look thinking directly in the eye be directly aware this is thinking

93
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,279
kind of like you were involved in a

94
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,279
you know strong active conversation with a group of people and then you stepped away 10 feet and

95
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:10,320
looked back at them and you observe the fact that they're talking

96
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:21,600
but you're not in that in the conversation so step back and allow yourself to think

97
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:35,839
but observe it

98
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,560
and if thinking quiets down

99
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:50,480
disappears even then you can begin again with your breathing until thinking returns

100
00:13:53,199 --> 00:14:00,240
but when thinking is there become aware of do you think

101
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:17,680
more in images or more in words

102
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:25,199
and is your thinking localized someplace in your body or in space

103
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:31,839
or does thinking seem to be unlocalized

104
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,360
in other words is there a place in your within you

105
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,959
where the voice that thinks

106
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,639
resides or the a projector screen

107
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,680
upon which the images appear

108
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,839
the place for that

109
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,519
and if there is a location that's associated with thinking

110
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:21,120
is it have a relaxed feeling or a contracted feeling

111
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:41,839
is there a lot of energy or is it very peaceful and calm

112
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:55,839
is there any pressure associated with thinking strong desire

113
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:05,519
tension and everything is okay

114
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,480
whatever you're experiencing as you think the exercise is just to know it just to

115
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:23,839
be aware maybe silently aware

116
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:46,160
is there any emotion that's connected to the thinking that pervades it or

117
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,839
fuels it

118
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:02,079
and if so for a few moments hold that awareness

119
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,918
gently tenderly in your awareness

120
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:19,839
no need to be for it or against it just aware of it

121
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,480
is there a tone of voice

122
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,520
that comes along with your thinking or is there a mood music that comes

123
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,919
along with the images

124
00:17:51,200 --> 00:18:01,840
the mood

125
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:15,840
and then as you're aware of your thinking are you bothered by it

126
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,919
is there a strong pull into it to be involved in it and

127
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,640
swept away in it

128
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,840
is there resistance to stepping away from it or letting go of it

129
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:16,720
and then beyond the edges of your thinking can you be aware of a stillness and

130
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,840
spaciousness or is your whole universe filled with

131
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,720
thinking or is thinking just a small little

132
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,240
corner of the universe surrounded by space and

133
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:53,840
stillness even by silence

134
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,760
rest back in that spaciousness

135
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,840
aware through the spaciousness

136
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,519
now if you'd like you can return to your breathing

137
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,720
gently peacefully quietly

138
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,320
a light touch with your breathing

139
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,840
but if thinking predominates

140
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:43,919
then bring this light touch awareness to look thinking right in the eye

141
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:51,200
thinking i see you there you are and take a few moments to feel the

142
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,880
experience of breathing without any interest in the content of

143
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,840
what you're thinking

144
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:35,840
and as we come to the end of this sitting

145
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,600
it might be interesting to consider how in a very in a room crowded with

146
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:50,960
people everyone talking loudly it's hard to really hear anyone

147
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:02,159
but if the everyone gets quiet and one person speaks it might be easy

148
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,200
to hear that person

149
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:14,840
if our mind is crowded with lots of conversations and lots of thoughts and

150
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:22,559
ideas if we're giving a lot of attention pulled into the world of our thinking

151
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:31,279
we might not be able to be present for others to hear what they say both what they say

152
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:44,399
and hear what is deeper in them than their words

153
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:53,279
at the end of a meditation session when we consider how we can bring benefit to the world

154
00:28:53,279 --> 00:29:00,399
from our meditation this is one of the reflections is that

155
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,600
now maybe i can listen more deeply to others

156
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:15,360
i can allow myself to be touched to be moved

157
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,640
by the living beating heart of another person

158
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,600
a form of respect and care for others

159
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,960
to take them in fully or as fully as we can

160
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,399
because we know how to be quieter in the mind

161
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:45,120
we know not to be swept away in our thoughts

162
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:58,240
and perhaps if we allow ourselves to really listen deeply to others

163
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,080
we can also then allow ours to we can also listen to ourselves deeply

164
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:11,039
not to our thoughts maybe but to the seat of kindness the place inside

165
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:16,320
where there can be respect and good will

166
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:23,840
compassion and care for others friendliness

167
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:36,960
and even if we don't feel friendly or kind there can be the aspiration

168
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,120
that someday we will be friendly we will have goodwill

169
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:51,520
the aspiration that someday we can live by these wishes

170
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,000
may all beings be happy

171
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:05,840
may all beings be free of suffering

172
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,840
may all beings live at peace

173
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,760
may all beings be free of oppression

174
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:34,559
may all beings be free and may it be

175
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:47,840
that in a loving way that we contribute to this possibility

176
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,770
[Music]

177
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:16,960
so i was introduced to the pasta practice in

178
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,440
southeast asia first in thailand and then a bit in nepal and then in in burma

179
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:30,559
quite a bit and then i came back united states and began participating in

180
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:37,120
the vipassana practice that was taught here by western teachers

181
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,519
and one of the differences was that

182
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:49,919
the western teachers when they talked retreats would have this systematic way in the

183
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,240
first days of the retreat of laying out the instructions much like how i've done it this week so

184
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:03,600
far they would begin the first day with mindfulness of breathing second day mindfulness of the body the

185
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:11,360
third day mindfulness of emotions and the fourth day mindfulness of thinking like today

186
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:18,000
and and then maybe a little bit more days of something at some point the instructions were

187
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
to bring all those together into a seamless hole

188
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,279
and uh and it turned out that these instructions in the beginning were kind of like learning the alphabet

189
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,960
once you learn the alphabet then you can put them together into words and sentences and

190
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:46,080
communicate and say to people write to people you know i love you or i apologize or

191
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,600
i forgive you all kinds of profound things we can say we can write once we know how to put those words

192
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:00,080
together those letters together so in

193
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:08,480
in in asia though it wasn't laid out in this kind of step-by-step way you would go to the

194
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,599
monastery and you were given the instructions in rel relatively quickly

195
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:20,960
maybe 15-20 minutes was and the basic idea was you sit down and you're present for

196
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,720
whatever is the most dominant predominant experience of the moment and if there

197
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:33,118
was nothing that was particularly predominant more predominant in the breathing then you would focus on the breathing

198
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,638
and that was a default that was the anchor to the present moment that keep you tethered to the present to

199
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,000
stay with the breath stay with the breath but the idea was not to hold everything

200
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,800
else at bay but rather if something else arose that was predominant meaning it

201
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,919
was kind of compelling and it got your attention

202
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:01,520
then the instruction was actually let go of the breath and bring your attention to this new

203
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,720
experience so if it was a compelling experience in the body

204
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:13,520
your knees hurt for example or a pleasant sensation arose then you would let go of the breathing

205
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,920
and you would take your mindfulness awareness and offer it to be present for this new

206
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:27,599
experience and just take that in if it was an emotion the same thing if it's thinking the same

207
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:33,520
thing and no matter what it was you would just bring that attention to it

208
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:41,280
when i was a relatively new zen student i had this colon this question that

209
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:48,960
i was very curious about i don't think i was perplexed exactly but i didn't really have an answer but

210
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,800
it was maybe i didn't need an answer it was kind of like

211
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:01,119
enlivening to have this question but it felt like there was something really true here in this question

212
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:07,200
and then i asked when my teacher said i think it was this way i said um

213
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,599
you know it's easy to see that how everything is different the rug in this room is different than

214
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,079
the wall it's different than the ceiling and the lamps that are here each of these are different things but

215
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:27,839
how are they all the same was my question and um and i never you know i never

216
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:35,119
try too hard to actively think about it you know logically what how they're all the same

217
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,400
i believe what was happening was that the sameness of them all

218
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,839
was somehow associated with how i was aware of them

219
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:51,520
that i was aware of everything with a certain kind of equanimity or openness or

220
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,119
respect for each thing each thing deserves its own respect for me

221
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,800
and um and so in this idea of wells in this vipassana practice

222
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,880
when you have when you know the alphabet and you put it all together then it becomes a seamless whole

223
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,040
and there's no part of human life human experience which is considered to be outside the

224
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,720
domain of the practice so no matter what we're experiencing

225
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:27,760
it is included yet this too is for my presence for my mindfulness and

226
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:34,800
um and so what i valued so much about the instructions of vipassana was the clear

227
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,599
instructions around doing that with things that like emotions and doing it for thinking

228
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:48,880
things that these are things i mostly ignored when i was practicing zen and sometimes to my detriment

229
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:56,160
because there was all these emotions that i had that i wasn't really aware of and didn't really know to pay attention to them

230
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:03,200
but in the seamless whole that i learned where everything is allowed to be

231
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,640
included and there's an element of respect that goes into this

232
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,760
uh this touching awareness touching the experience with awareness

233
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:20,640
really taking it in and letting it kind of register and almost as if you're allowing it to

234
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:27,119
be felt in a deep way and known in a deep way as if it's a it's a valuable thing it's

235
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:33,599
a everything's allowed to be there and they have this idea in zen which was very important for me

236
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:41,520
of uh the suchness of experience the thus-ness of experience each thing is in its own suchness

237
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:48,560
can exist uh and uh there's suchness how i understood this is is was kind of

238
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:56,320
how that whatever is being experienced thing how it's been how it has experienced before

239
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,599
the judgments before that ideas are being for or against it

240
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:09,119
before all the kind of clear what clearly can be seen as the mind's kind of response reactions

241
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,440
ideas about it just the experience in its own pristine

242
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,359
simplicity so this can be done with something like thinking so rather than

243
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:27,599
thinking that thinking is bad the thinking is the problem because thinking is what is the reaction to

244
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:36,640
things thinking is what doesn't allow things to be in their pristine suchness the um

245
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,320
rather than kind of having that attitude towards thinking it's rather this a wonderful thing of

246
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:49,599
turning the attention 180 degrees around and when there's thinking is a really strong

247
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:56,240
or predominant to really be mindful of thinking

248
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:03,200
and in a sense the you know pristine suchness of thinking and have you ever thought

249
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,240
about what a have you ever considered what a thought is

250
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:14,240
have you ever kind of held the thought in your hand palm of your hand to feel its weight

251
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:21,680
or if you ever try to touch a thought and see you know how flexible is it how pliant

252
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,800
is it can you push it and it gives or is it hard or do you go right through it with your

253
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:33,680
your thought have you ever considered what color your thoughts are or

254
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,960
how large they are how small they are for some some of us when we have these

255
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,000
kinds of thoughts the whole relationship to thinking begins to shift

256
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,839
because a lot of the substance of thinking has to do with our involvement with it

257
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:57,839
our desperation or anger or desires or intensity around how we think and

258
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:03,520
you know carrying the burden of the world on our shoulders has a lot to do with our relationship to

259
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,720
thinking how intensely we're involved in all these thoughts and ideas

260
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,079
and um and uh this question you know how much is thinking away

261
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:19,920
is one of the ways for some of us to shift back out of being so glued and glammed on to

262
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:27,359
thinking that you know we're carrying it so heavily or it's claustrophobic in our minds because of it all and

263
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,040
and and then start creating space and a very common experience for people

264
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,240
as they meditate if they're able to get settled is the thinking mind

265
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,440
doesn't necessarily go away but it stops being one thought after another or the

266
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,040
thoughts the thoughts stop feeling so heavy or so dense so

267
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:57,359
so compelling and they get lighter and lighter and thinner and thinner and softer and softer and

268
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,560
they can be just as profound as before but there's all this extra way in which we

269
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:09,119
infuse them with weight infuse them with intensity begins to quiet down so if we turn

270
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:17,839
attention around to really look at thinking to be present for thought just the way we be present for thinking

271
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,920
with a light touch with a you know just seeing if what it is part of what we're seeing also looking

272
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:31,119
at is the way that we relate to thinking what is our involvement with thoughts

273
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:37,200
and the pristine suchness of seeing our involvement

274
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,280
it's very easy to say well now it's okay i learned i don't want to get rid of my thoughts they're not my enemy

275
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:50,720
but i'm not supposed to be so attached to them or so involved in them and then now i'm a bad meditator in

276
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:58,400
vipassana practice and in zen practice i believe there's no sustain as a bad meditator

277
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:08,400
is just one more thing to experience in in its pristine simplicity

278
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:15,920
oh this is me chasing my thoughts this is me

279
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:22,319
kind of contracting around this set of thoughts this is me being so interested in this

280
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:30,000
particular concern oh this is what it is this is what it is and then as we do

281
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,800
vipassana practice we learn more and more this seamless hole where we bring this

282
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:43,920
quiet light touch presence to anything that is happening

283
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:49,760
anything that's compelling in the moment and with time we get a sense that because

284
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,839
the attention now the awareness now is inclusive that nothing is left out

285
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:03,359
it becomes sacred or the world becomes sacred because the awareness and the world are

286
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:11,440
not exactly two different things we have an awareness which is includes has a sense that includes

287
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:17,760
everything not actively in the moment but it's ready to include everything

288
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,599
as soon as awareness as a something that's outside of what's acceptable for

289
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,760
awareness what we're not supposed to pay attention to then this my sense of this sacred

290
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:37,280
sacredness disappears but when there's no outside and everything is included there's no

291
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,680
outside then maybe there's no inside either it's just this seamless hole that we're

292
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,880
able to sit in not being bothered by anything but ready

293
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,960
to respect and care for everything

294
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:01,520
so um may you that in these next 24 hours

295
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:07,200
may be interesting for you to look at your relationship to thinking

296
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,640
and consider is there some way a wiser way to relate to thinking is

297
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,680
there a useful vantage point in which to experience and

298
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:25,599
know that you're thinking that that kind of suggests to you something

299
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,880
about the sacred dimension of this world that comes through the

300
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:43,359
medium of being aware so thank you all very much
