1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:06,680
so welcome welcome to everybody it's nice to be here with you

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,480
all today I'm going to continue on this theme of poetry of

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,039
practice and today I'm going to use a poem that chances are you've heard it I

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,840
think that I've heard it a number of times in Dharma talks but there's something about this poem and I would

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,840
say in all poems that have a I don't know the poems

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,840
that tend to touch us share something with the sutas you know like the early

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:43,559
Buddhist literature and what they share is this um depth or maybe we could say

8
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,520
width that is even though with we might read them or hear them again we find

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,440
something different we hear something different and I know certainly in the

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,640
sutas this is true for me many of you know that um Gil and I have like T thought suas for a number of years now

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,680
we're not currently teaching a course right now but uh and we often are saying

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,119
this like wow we've taught this uh already once before but when we look at it again we're finding something new and

13
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:22,280
and the same thing with poems that even though they might be similar that we find something new when

14
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:31,840
we look at them and I only I only might they be similar might they be the exact same poem but maybe we're not the same

15
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,240
and um this poem that I will drop in during our

16
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,200
guided meditation this morning something that's very simple it doesn't have a lot

17
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:51,880
of uh complicated uh imagery but it has some real distinct imagery or doesn't

18
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:58,840
have a lot of comp complicated Concepts but maybe part of the power is in its

19
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,079
simplicity part of the power is part of the imagery that's been used that I

20
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:12,120
think all of us can find a part of our Lives find something that uh is relevant

21
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,640
or to this particular poem and I will give the name of the

22
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,920
poem and the name of the poet after I ring the bell because I would just you

23
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:32,319
know allow yourself to just experience it without already having some preconceived ideas of whether you know

24
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:39,080
the poem or not or what it's about or sometimes when we're on our computers there's a Temptation like oh just Google

25
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,560
it or you know something because but um just encouragement just to allow the

26
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,840
poem to be received and experienced and then um we can explore

27
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,000
it together afterwards

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,720
okay just uh taking our meditation

29
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:15,400
posture I find myself doing this long exhale as a part of a way to like shift

30
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:23,200
gears like to orient towards oh now now is a time for

31
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,799
meditation if that's helpful for you you could take some

32
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:38,040
big exhales and as that's happening allowing

33
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:46,080
the body to adjust in any small or maybe even large

34
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,519
ways so that you can feel balanced

35
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:01,680
upright alert and with ease

36
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:17,280
can be helpful for some people to make a very small movement where they move

37
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,280
their chin like back like back towards

38
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:31,000
um backwards so not up or down but back a little maybe slight sense of

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,440
tucking this opens up the spine there in our

40
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,159
neck can allow for a little more balance of the head over the

41
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
shoulders

42
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,759
doing a light body scan checking

43
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,360
in with the

44
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:22,160
face humans are expressive of course we are and our

45
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:32,000
face is often a place where we can hold tension around the eyes or the jaw or

46
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,080
mouth resting Awareness on those

47
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:50,638
areas with an invitation to soften relax

48
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,720
open resting attention on the

49
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:11,560
shoulders letting them also have some ease the shoulder blades sliding down

50
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,800
the

51
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:31,400
back the chest the belly

52
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:42,240
and feeling the pressure against the body the chair the cushion couch bed

53
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,240
whatever it is that we're sitting on literally or

54
00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:01,400
figuratively upper legs

55
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,840
lower

56
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,080
legs

57
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
f

58
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:44,639
arms just resting our attention nothing needs to be done so to speak we're just

59
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:51,400
moving the awareness scanning the

60
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,360
body tuning into the sensations in the

61
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,800
hands are the hands

62
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,120
touching is it smooth or

63
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,520
rough it warm or

64
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:36,839
cool and tuning into the experience of having

65
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:44,000
hands vibrancy this embodiment of hands there might be a

66
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,880
tingling sense of Vitality sense of

67
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
energy

68
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,760
and expanding that attention into the

69
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:25,440
vibrant experience of being embodied expanding that to the whole

70
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,120
body in a relaxed easy way

71
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,720
maybe there's a way in which in a

72
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:46,560
sense this embodiment just gets as big as it would

73
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,440
like this sense of

74
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
aliveness

75
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:11,000
we're here now

76
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
experiencing

77
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:36,760
this and then resting attention on the sensations of

78
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:44,440
breathing the movement of the body as it

79
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
breathes

80
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,010
and can we do this being present with the experience of

81
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:39,880
[Music] breathing with a sense of warmth and

82
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:49,279
care we're not trying to force ourselves we're not beating ourselves

83
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,560
up and we find the mind is

84
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:04,000
squirly maybe some more like curiosity or like

85
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,680
petting a

86
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,880
cat of course petting a dog

87
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,800
too and when the mind wanders we just very

88
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,920
simply gently begin

89
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,399
again making a story chastising ourselves that's

90
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:55,480
extra it's not needed just allow that to be in the

91
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
background

92
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:01,880
tuning into the experience of inhale and

93
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,199
exhales the embodied

94
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,759
experience not about thinking or concepts but a different type of

95
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
knowing

96
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240

97
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:16,400

129
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,360
deep hole in the sidewalk I walk around

130
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:05,600
it chapter five I walk down another

131
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
Street

132
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
for

133
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:43,000
chapter five I walk down another

134
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,579
[Music]

135
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
Street

136
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:30,840
so this poem is by Porsha Nelson it's called autobiography in five short

137
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:36,320
chapters again that's Porsche Nelson autobiography in five short

138
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:43,240
chapters I think I just love this uh title it's pretty you know

139
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,960
descriptive I'm just going to stop the recording and then do a new one

140
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
here

141
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:10,840
okay so here we are talking about uh yet another

142
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:20,240
poem that uh we explored during the guided meditation and I'll read it again

143
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,320
here chapter or maybe I'll just say that the excuse me the title of the poem is

144
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:32,440
autobiography and five short chapters by Porsha

145
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:38,399
Nelson I think maybe if I had to said the title at the beginning maybe there'd be a little bit different understanding

146
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:44,080
of the poem but um if I said the at the beginning of the guided meditation but

147
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,559
here we are so chapter one I walk down the

148
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:56,240
street there's a deep hole in the sidewalk I fall in I am lost I'm

149
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:03,799
helpless it isn't my fault it takes me forever to find a way

150
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,919
out chapter 2 I walk down the same street there's a deep hole in the

151
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:17,679
sidewalk I pretend I don't see it I fall in again I can't believe I'm in the same

152
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:24,000
place but it isn't my fault it still takes a long time to get

153
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,760
out chapter 3 I walk down the same street there's a deep hole in the

154
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,960
sidewalk I see it is there I still fall in it's a

155
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:44,760
habit My Eyes Are Open I know where I am it is my fault I get out

156
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,480
immediately I walk down the same street there's a deep hole in the sidewalk I

157
00:32:51,480 --> 00:33:01,039
walk around it chapter 5 I walk down another

158
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:08,080
street right I can't I find myself smiling when I'm saying this partly because uh you know this poem it's so

159
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:16,039
simple right it's not complicated you know that we have to like figure it out but maybe that's part

160
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:21,919
of its beauty and part of its power is its Simplicity one thing that I appreciate

161
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,639
very much is of course this uh poem it has a pattern right you know the

162
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:35,159
different chapters uh kind of like all start the same and maybe in the same way for those

163
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:40,919
of you who are familiar with sutas know that many of the sutas have the same thing where there's this repetition this

164
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:46,200
repetition except like one little bit is changed this is a real common

165
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:52,919
theme and let's be honest it's a common theme in our lives that we have patterns

166
00:33:52,919 --> 00:34:01,799
and some of them are more helpful than others but just this recognition that patterns is such a part of our life the

167
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:07,159
way that we behave and the grooves that we can get stuck in as well as the

168
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:13,040
grooves that can really support us regular meditation Practice coming to 7

169
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:20,358
AM regularly and connecting with others on in the chats or having a SAA in some

170
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:27,800
kind of way so just this recognition of the power of patterns and both those way that they

171
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:34,919
show up in our lives but also in the way that uh we learn things like we learn like oh yeah this

172
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:42,040
is similar but this little bit is different and sometimes what's different is what gets

173
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:47,440
highlighted because in the same way even though this poem of course has this pattern that's getting repeated and

174
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,878
repeated there's also this clear sense of progression there's a sense of movement

175
00:34:53,879 --> 00:35:01,079
like literally the speaker is walking down the sidewalk but also

176
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:07,640
figuratively you can sense that there's more and more freedom until it at the end you know just this oh I'm going to

177
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:14,079
walk down a different street so this

178
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:20,960
movement and I'll maybe I'll just say that when I read this poem and I hear this walking down the street what comes

179
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,200
to my mind it might not come to other people's minds but when we take refuge

180
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:34,280
in the Buddha Dharma and sa many of you have done this this is a tradition that we do the beginning of

181
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,839
Retreats and we chant

182
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:46,720
buam literally means like I I go for refuge in the Buddha Dr

183
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,839
and S but this idea I go for Refuge is sometimes good Chi can be translated as

184
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:00,800
like I walk towards so so there's a way in which we can this sense of movement

185
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:07,400
is such an integral part of our life and maybe there's a way in which we can

186
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,640
influence where we're walking the direction we're

187
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:19,680
going because something that I else that I really appreciate appreciate about this poem that might I didn't understand

188
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:27,040
or didn't appreciate the first time I heard this or maybe even the second time I heard this poem but this time was

189
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:34,599
looking at this is that there's this sense of resilience there's a sense of

190
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:39,760
resolve the speaker continues walking down the street they didn't sit down and

191
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:47,280
refuse okay I'm give up I'm not going to walk anymore or anything like this and

192
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,520
one way we might understand this is that the the speaker has a growth mindset a

193
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,400
belief that the person's capacity can be

194
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:06,280
improved in contrast with a sorry a fixed mindset this a limiting belief

195
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:13,760
that oh we can't it's all we can't change nothing's going to be different it's always going to be like

196
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,920
this and it turns out more and more that having this growth

197
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:26,400
mindset turns out to be incredibly impactful just this General belief that

198
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:35,319
things things can change that they can be different yes there are patterns but they're not always 100% the

199
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:41,520
same when we find ourselves in these patterns something different that's

200
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:49,359
happening maybe we're different occasion is different and um of course in this poem part of

201
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,520
the difference and part of the progression of this poem is the amount of awareness the speaker

202
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:01,960
has chapter one the speaker says I am lost I am helpless know just this kind

203
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,720
of recrimination kind of beating oneself up with then the second one's maybe a

204
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:13,240
little bit more awareness like oh okay I see it but I pretend that I don't and

205
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:20,640
this is human nature we often like okay I'm see it but maybe if I ignore it it'll go away if I look the other way

206
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,920
you know maybe maybe it won't be there and then the third chapter I still

207
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:34,760
Fallen it's a habit My Eyes Are Open I know where I am so this recognition of

208
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:42,599
oh yeah this is a something that uh recurs in my life this is a pattern I

209
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:48,040
have and then things begin to shift in the later chapters after there's this

210
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:53,599
recognition I know where I am they're not saying that they like it

211
00:38:53,599 --> 00:39:00,119
they're not saying it's fun it's not saying it's their preferences is they're just saying oh I know where I am and

212
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:07,720
then things really begin to shift they start walking around the hole and then they start walking down another

213
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:14,040
street so part of this uh progression and practice in our lives maybe we can

214
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:20,640
even use this word uh maturity is not only about awareness but it's also about

215
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:27,720
our relationship to what's happening that starts to shift

216
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:34,720
like we don't get to choose what life brings us what kind of holes there are in our sidewalks we don't get to choose

217
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,720
that but what can be shifted is our relationship to what

218
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:48,319
happens to our lives in one way is the amount of blaming do we have the sense like okay

219
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:54,880
it's it's a problem for things that are out there they have to be changed this person has to behave

220
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,880
differently this institution has to beh differently you know everything out there the problem is out there without

221
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:08,040
looking at in here and to be sure I am not saying that uh people are victims

222
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:14,880
and that uh things out there are perfect of course not right that's not helpful

223
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,520
and nor is it accurate but is there a way in which we

224
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,960
are focusing on what the speaker here in this poem says in chapter 1

225
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:33,920
it's not my fault so instead there's kind of like this stubbornness like I don't have to

226
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:40,079
do anything everything out there has to be different and they say this the speaker

227
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:46,640
says this again in the second chapter so until we get to the third chapter and we say it is my fault and then they

228
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,200
immediately get out of the hole there's a connection

229
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:58,040
here between whether we spend energy blaming

230
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:04,599
maybe it's blaming what's out there but maybe we even are blaming ourselves and when we like put down the

231
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:11,359
blaming this is when things are shifting can be different and to be sure like

232
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:16,880
part of this practice is developing our character and developing wisdom this

233
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,960
patient uh training and repeated cultivation right this is a part of

234
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,119
practice working with the patterns of our minds and hearts and gradually

235
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:34,200
shaping the direction of Our Lives because something else that's also

236
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:39,680
implicit in this poem that we don't see is this restraining from acting on

237
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:48,200
impulses that cause harm we don't see the speaker in this

238
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:55,760
poem intentionally harming thrashing out hurting others hurting themselves but

239
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,880
maybe systematically like kind of like bringing their attention back to being

240
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:09,880
present perhaps rather than lost in thought or and you might say even cultivating

241
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,440
mindfulness and many of you know this but some of the parames these um

242
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,280
qualities that really support finding more freedom that we do in our daily

243
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,760
life these qualities the parames and often translated as the perfection

244
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:33,720
include patience resolve loving

245
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,960
kindness to doing this with warmth and the factors of Awakening which also

246
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:45,960
support this movement towards greater and greater freedom in cour includes tranquility and

247
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,839
equinity so these qualities kind like implicit in this

248
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:58,960
poem we might say that through cultivating just showing up for our

249
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:05,240
lives The Good the Bad and the Ugly right our lives are a mixture of

250
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:13,240
things part of it is to just keep showing up and then maybe allowing these

251
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:18,359
beautiful qualities these positive qualities that are already in our hearts

252
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:26,960
and Minds allowing them to Blossom allowing the wisdom

253
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:34,240
to shine through maybe some Faith some confidence

254
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:41,720
that okay I'm GNA keep on walking down this street until we realize oh there's

255
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:47,319
something completely different there's another Street maybe one last thing that I'll

256
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:55,640
say here is you notice that the the speaker of this poem is not

257
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:00,720
emphas izing that we have to be completely different because the

258
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:08,760
patterns and we might even use this word archetypes that make up our individuality they're beautiful it's not

259
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:17,160
something that we have to completely change this practice this poem is not asking us to be somebody we are

260
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:23,720
not it's just allowing some transformation to change to arise change

261
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:30,680
to arise so that we all can find Freedom we can walk down the streets

262
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:38,359
that allows us to have our best life our best wisdom to show up and maybe some of these other streets

263
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:44,960
are a way that we can help other people that our learning like oh watch

264
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:53,280
out there's a hole in that sidewalk is something we can share with others it's not to stop walking and it's

265
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:59,839
not to become a different person but it's allowed the wisdom to

266
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,720
Blossom inside of all of

267
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,760
us autobiography in five short chapters by Porsha

268
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:18,880
