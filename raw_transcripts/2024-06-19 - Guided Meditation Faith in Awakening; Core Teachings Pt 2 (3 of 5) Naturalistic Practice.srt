1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:08,600
so hello everyone and

2
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:23,640
welcome so the what I'd like

3
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:32,119
to suggest today is that uh we focus the

4
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,120
meditation

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,840
on uh Faith meditation supported by

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,920
faith and Faith sometimes is seen as being extremely religious

7
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,559
uh phenomena emotion motivation and maybe it

8
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:05,239
is but rather than thinking of it it's something that we can't experience and know and something not relevant to

9
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:12,758
exactly here and now the faith I propose is the faith and the

10
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:21,439
practice and uh we call on faith to to practice here with a little bit of kind of

11
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:28,280
analysis we could or orientation we could think of many of us spend much of

12
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,439
the day having faith in the wrong things that whatever your mind is

13
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,600
preoccupied with that is something that you or your mind has faith in that it's

14
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,680
valuable to do so it's purposeful to do so it's and we put a lot of faith into

15
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,920
sometimes fantasy sometimes planning sometimes remembering and

16
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,360
reviewing and we have put Faith in desires for things we have faith in aversion in things and to put our faith

17
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,759
in those things uh sure changes us it limits

18
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:12,520
us and instead when we put Faith in the

19
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,640
practice we are making room and space for something within us something that's

20
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:26,560
unlimited something which is not defined by Me Myself and mind something that can

21
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,400
grow and expand and develop and be creative and uh and be

22
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,239
freeing and the simplest way of saying what the faith is when we practice is we

23
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,360
have faith in being awake and I use this word carefully

24
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:55,879
because instead of saying faith in being mindful faith of being aware um to be awake is a in in a in a

25
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:04,239
sense it doesn't refer to an activity that we do but a state that we are in we

26
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,159
can be sleeping at night then in the morning we wake up and we're awake then

27
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:19,680
it's just the quality of a characteristic of being somewhat maybe clear somewhat um maybe uh conscious

28
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,879
somewhat uh there's a present for our experience and but without putting any

29
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,239
restrictions on anything without uh having to focus on

30
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:40,760
something it just being awake in the midst of what this life of ours and to have faith in being awake

31
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,680
and reason why this is so significant is that

32
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:54,319
um an awareness an alertness a presence that um doesn't restrict anything

33
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,480
doesn't interfere with anything doesn't reinforce anything

34
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,680
uh doesn't reinforce the unhealthy activities of our mind and it makes room

35
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,439
for some profoundly deep healthy activities of the mind it makes room for

36
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:18,280
healing it makes room for settling makes room for uh

37
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:25,280
uniting unification of all we are it makes room for growth and development

38
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,560
that we can't engineer so to have faith in being

39
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:39,240
awake and as we sit uh for this sitting maybe

40
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:47,440
um you can just very gently gingerly tenderly use the word

41
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,800
awake maybe each time you

42
00:04:53,479 --> 00:05:02,000
exhale or maybe at the beginning of the inhale but say the word with faith in

43
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,199
the value of being having a living

44
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,600
awareness living attention to this

45
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,880
moment as if you're making room for whatever is

46
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:24,759
there without reinforcing

47
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,840
anything without participating in thoughts and desires and

48
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:39,319
aversions where being awake is bigger wider than anything any involvement with

49
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:49,560
anything where there's room for what is healthy to grow and develop and do its

50
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:56,800
work awake so assuming a meditation

51
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:04,199
posture that may maybe has a little intentionality in

52
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,479
it that encourages a a

53
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:24,520
wakefulness if you're sitting upright maybe your spine

54
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,840
can be a little bit more alert if you're sitting in a chair

55
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,599
laying laying back into the back rest even so you

56
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:44,160
might readjust slightly so you're a little bit more

57
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,240
alert in your spine and if you're laying

58
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,319
down maybe there too you can adjust the shoulder blades so that they are a

59
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,759
little bit more maybe roll and kind of slide down the

60
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:09,720
back providing a stronger flatter surface for supporting your upper

61
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,039
back and maybe such a way that your chest maybe comes out a little

62
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,120
bit closing your eyes

63
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,400
relaxing on the

64
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:55,159
exhales relaxing in your body

65
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,759
relaxing in your mind

66
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,919
and then with some regular intervals maybe coordinated with the

67
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:43,880
breathing or maybe not gently almost as a whisper almost as

68
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:51,240
of a ever so light Breeze almost as if you're not saying

69
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,640
anything maybe it's a not even a

70
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:06,959
nonverbal knowing say or know the word

71
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,200
awake as if something in your whole mental and physical

72
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,959
systems knows what that is recognizes

73
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:33,000
that the word awake awakens being

74
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:45,160
awake a wakefulness in which your present moment

75
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,440
experience of body of

76
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:59,959
breathing of mind is known is revealed

77
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:07,480
without any restrictions or judgments or

78
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:30,839
participation with the word awake reminding yourself

79
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,240
of having faith deep Faith full

80
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,880
faith inner

81
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:59,360
attention that gives infinite room for all things to be in the present

82
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,880
without participating with any of

83
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240

remembering

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,360
to be

104
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:43,080
awake and being awake is similar to

105
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,158
making Infinite Space around

106
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,600
everything so that what needs to settle can settle

107
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,880
relax and what is healthy and good can grow or

108
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:14,320
expand independent of you making anything

109
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,080
happen except remembering to be

110
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
awake

111
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440

for for

118
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:45,520
and as we come to the end of this

119
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:59,158
sitting to tap into once more what Within

120
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:07,200
Comes Alive around the word word

121
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:11,679
awake to be

122
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:18,960
awake to wake

123
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:32,320
up to awaken a sense

124
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,880
of living attention in the present

125
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:50,720
moment an attention that maybe is connected to a sense of

126
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:58,200
Vitality even if we're sick or tired there is evidence of being alive

127
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,080
in every Sensation that we

128
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:14,919
have and to be awake is to make lots of room give breathing room to

129
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,919
everything deep faith that we don't have to fix

130
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:30,880
or do or make happen we can

131
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:39,720
allow something deeper to awaken as we stay

132
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,278
awake Awakening from our

133
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,679
depths and then to include and

134
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,840
in our wakefulness other people other living

135
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:14,480
beings where we give Infinite Space and room for them to be just as they

136
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,720
are easier to do if if we allowed ourselves to be that

137
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:28,039
way and we don't allow anything to diminish us ourselves

138
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:41,039
and in this field of relating this related

139
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:49,519
relatedness to others in the in being

140
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:59,360
awake may we spread our good will our compassion our

141
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:05,279
care may all beings be

142
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,320
happy may all beings be

143
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,440
safe may all beings be

144
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:22,120
peaceful may all beings be free

145
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,089
[Music]

146
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,240
thank

147
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
you for

148
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:42,679
so hello everyone and welcome to this third talk as I

149
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:49,240
continue for the second week um conveying trying to convey some

150
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:56,360
of the core teachings that underly my orientation my perspective as

151
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:02,080
a Buddhist teacher and it's uh building on what I said last

152
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:08,480
week so it's part two of the same topics and

153
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,600
um so today it's uh the uh my my

154
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:21,399
teachings are based on a very strong naturalistic orientation and um and what I mean by

155
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:27,399
naturalistic is that um it's in the world of our direct experience things we

156
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:32,960
can know for ourselves we can experience for

157
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:40,440
ourselves that uh we don't have to uh explain things with things that we

158
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:46,399
can't really know or can't really discover uh so the supernatural World

159
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:54,000
which is such a big part of religion often and Buddhism as well um uh not to

160
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,639
dismiss that or say that it's wrong or not true it's just not the orientation of how I

161
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:05,679
teach it's almost like I put those that aside as if it's not something we have

162
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:13,440
to address or deal with for this path of Liberation path of practice for uh

163
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,279
living a life of compassion and love and

164
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:24,840
um so this naturalistic uh approach um

165
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:32,440
can be explained a little bit as uh as is pointing out that in the early Buddhist teaching it's it appears that

166
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:42,320
the Buddha when he taught without saying it in this kind of modern way uh uh uh presented the human being

167
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,919
as having two separate operating systems that uh are not really

168
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:54,360
comparable or not not equal or uh not

169
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:02,240
but they're operating it's almost like apples and oranges they being very different from each other so

170
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,720
the one of them the one that is uh so there's a wholesome one and the UNH

171
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:14,679
wholesome one and the uh UNH wholesome uh operating system is the one that is

172
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:20,878
founded on Greed hate and delusion and greed hate and delusion are I think of

173
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:30,839
as as deep as they might seem in a human being they're much more surface reactions to things and um and uh they

174
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:37,440
engage our surface muscles our surface thoughts our engagement and our uh often

175
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:44,720
they engage our uh ideas and Concepts and conceits of self Me Myself and mine

176
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:52,398
what I want what who I am um that is kind of an overlay on top of a broader

177
00:34:52,399 --> 00:35:00,440
wider experience of what it is to be a human being so uh the uh this operating system

178
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:07,520
that's founded on Greed hate and delusion is uh also one that constructs

179
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,320
Engineers so it uh imagines and thinks about things and builds up stories it's

180
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:20,280
the world of um uh make belief making things up and most of us maybe don't

181
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:28,240
live in a world that we think of is make believe but um uh I remember reading d

182
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,839
this wonderful novel and um and the um

183
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:39,760
and you know UNC conventional way Don kyote was living in the world of delusion but it turned out by the end of

184
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,839
the book it would seem that um um everyone else was living in a socially

185
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:51,920
constructed world of all these rules and behavior and Concepts that people were

186
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:59,119
navigating that was more delusive than seem seemed normal but more delusive than Don coyote and he had these

187
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:06,480
fundamentally beautiful values that he was living by that uh raised the question what is what is delusion what

188
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,599
is not delusion and um so this constructed

189
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:17,920
world of that we live in that we inherit from our society and it has it teaches

190
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,200
us profound things about who we are who we think we are the constructed

191
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:29,520
self the other operating system of the Buddha is uh can be can be

192
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:36,240
simplistically called the holistic uh side of it of our life uh it's uh from a

193
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:44,160
deeper Source within and it's a source of uh of life within of source of

194
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,000
thoughts s source of emotions s source of motivation which is not made up it

195
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,119
doesn't involve a makeup made up World Concepts and constructs does not involve

196
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:01,520
greated hate and delusion but arises some deeper movements from deep

197
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,480
within and um and um the uh maybe that

198
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:14,079
they arise from the opposite of greet hi and delusion from um generosity love and

199
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:21,880
wisdom maybe they arise from uh an organic Source within uh meaning that uh it's something

200
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:28,520
that we don't construct but something we allow to grow that uh we uh we can build

201
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:34,480
and construct a house but we cannot build and construct a baby we can allow

202
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,599
the natural abilities of of of gestation

203
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:45,720
to allow the embryo to grow and develop over time and it's remarkable that this

204
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,800
something that's so much more complex than a house uh can um can become

205
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:59,119
somehow grow and evolve and develop uh and our uh the task of a mother is to

206
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:05,920
allow the best conditions for that life to unfold within develop

207
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,680
within so it's not a coincidence that I use this as as the example because one

208
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,960
of the sources of this deeper way of living that the Buddha talks about is he

209
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:23,480
talks about the yonis which can be the place where life begins and so for

210
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:32,119
humans that's sometimes considered to be the womb so there's a there's a place where life gestates uh the the uh the

211
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:38,000
emerges that it um um and uh and from

212
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,920
deep within and that's not constructed and so these two operating

213
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,079
systems have very different ways of relating to it one we we engage in and

214
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:56,640
fight with and fix and and adjust and and uh the other one we have to get out

215
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:04,520
of the way for and allow we have to recognize it make room and space and the wonderfulness about the

216
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:10,240
Dharma practice is that as we were mindful of things as we're awake and

217
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:16,680
present uh it has uh a different effects on these two systems operating systems

218
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,960
the operating system that is based on Greed hate and delusion is a system that's based on

219
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:27,400
tension and as we're aware of it and present for it that tends to help the

220
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:33,240
ention relaxed the system that is the operating system that's

221
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,359
gestational that's emergent um that something that grows

222
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:44,800
and develops um with the food and nourishment of attention the space of

223
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,560
attention it has more room to grow it is more develop to unfold and develop and

224
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,599
move so attachments tend to move towards

225
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:01,839
letting go and and uh the Deep wisdom of Awakening

226
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:08,800
the Deep compassion the Deep uh Faith the Deep equinity the Deep peace grows

227
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,359
and develops The Joy the happiness of practice grows and develops from this deeper

228
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:21,240
source and um and these two operating system I associate with um the

229
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:27,560
difference between uh fight and flight and approach and nurture

230
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:33,599
that um um the fight and flight engages the surface muscles it's a muscular

231
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,560
thing uh approach a nurture uh to nurture and support and tend something

232
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:47,520
like uh like a gardener tends a plants um that tending uh is something that um

233
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:55,839
uh is a deeper Instinct a deeper motivation it involves something deeper than our musculature that uh is operating exactly

234
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:04,520
what that biological source is maybe you know we can have all kinds of speculation but for the Buddha it was um

235
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:11,000
something that was not of the muscles not of the flesh that was somehow deeper

236
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:18,720
within so in saying my uh my orientation is naturalistic it's um appreciating

237
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:26,599
something that's very natural about the human being that is healthy and wonderful and capable of healing and

238
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:33,560
developing growth um where and one of the things it wants to grow into is a

239
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:41,640
freedom from the restrictions freedom from the limitations of um of what this uh greed

240
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:47,440
hate and delusion um operating system provides us that the tension holds Us in

241
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,720
check in some way so um so

242
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,200
um you might consider that uh uh we have you have these two different operating

243
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:05,440
systems and which of them do you have faith in which of them do you which of

244
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:12,040
them do you uh feed and support and strengthen over time by participating it

245
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:19,000
and engaging in it and part of Dharma practice is to have a deep faith in this

246
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,800
natural naturalistic source within us that arises and operates the more the

247
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,200
constructing mind the Conceited the kind of sense of self the Me Myself and mine

248
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:37,559
um quiets down and makes room for it and it's remarkable how much self-

249
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:46,200
preoccupation how much self criticism how much self um Concepts that we live under that

250
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:53,599
um uh we can put down we can have faith we don't have to continue that

251
00:42:53,599 --> 00:43:00,880
way we can let go of the faith we have in me myself and

252
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,839
mine in terms of this preoccupation and and concerns and thinking over and over

253
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:12,640
again about me as the central character of my drama of my

254
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:19,640
life to something deeper inside that wants to be emerge that's

255
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:28,559
growing and um and uh to continue with this metaphor of of you know of U of

256
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:35,880
human being kind of growing as an embryo within um one of the one of the

257
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:42,480
wonderful things I experiences I had as a young parent when my kids were young

258
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:50,280
was just the kind of seemingly natural way in which um I became less important

259
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:57,240
my own concerns and and my own you know preoccupations with self

260
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:04,160
fell away for just caring for a young baby I mean sometimes it was quite tired

261
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,640
sometimes there was not a time to take a shower so occasionally I you know I was more I had to take care of the kid

262
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:15,319
rather than maybe even um you know eating when I was hungry staying up late

263
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:20,680
at night when the kid was sick um and knowing the next day I'd be tired for

264
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:26,520
teaching the Dharma um the usual way in which I maybe I've been involved in my

265
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:33,400
own con concerns kind of fell away and it felt so freeing so wonderful uh to do

266
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:42,800
that so uh to have faith in this natural operating system that we have

267
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:49,640
and not have Fai faith in what in this kind of way of talking is

268
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:58,680
unnatural uh the constructed the imaginary the the uh the um

269
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:07,119
the make believe that we often live in so thank you very much and

270
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:13,640
uh and um we'll continue this topic these themes

271
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:21,440
tomorrow also before we end I meant to do this at the beginning I want to um

272
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:27,119
just for a moment celebrate with you that this is juneth day and uh so

273
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:33,319
wonderful holiday because of um any holiday that celebrates Independence and

274
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:39,640
freedom is a Buddhist holiday and for us as Buddhists to focus on Liberation to

275
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:48,280
appreciate the the worldly Liberation that's such an important thing that people to have that uh uh that was long

276
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:54,400
coming for the slaves in America is um a wonderful thing to celebrate and if

277
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,960
you'd like to join us this uh evening at here in California at 6:00 p.m. uh we're

278
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:08,960
having a um juneth Day celebration by the wonderful uh teacher uh an Roy who

279
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,359
um uh some of you might know she's uh taught for mindfulness Circle for black

280
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:23,720
practitioners and she's also taught the happy hour so thank you
