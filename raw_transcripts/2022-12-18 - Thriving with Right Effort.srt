1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,380
so

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:13,080
what's on my mind on my heart a bit is a might seem initially maybe a little bit

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:22,039
of an interesting topic I hope I can make it interesting and and that is the the

4
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:28,140
sixth factor of the Eightfold Path which is right effort

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,239
and maybe one thing that will kind of maybe pique your interest around this

6
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:40,739
topic of right effort is the first time many years ago I was over 25 years ago that I gave a series

7
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,899
of talks on the Eightfold Path one of the most important teachings of the Buddha

8
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:53,100
and I did it you know I was going to do it one factor for every evening and so I was going through the factors

9
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:00,480
and then it was time to do the factor on right effort and I without any comment or explanation

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,920
or recognition that I was doing it I consciously skipped it

11
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:18,960
and no no one asked me about why'd you skip it and uh and um the reason I skipped it

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,680
was I could I wasn't really behind it I couldn't quite get myself inspired by it

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,060
and some of it had to do with my background in Zen where in Zen there was a really clear

14
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:39,060
teaching admonition to not do any not strive not have any goal orientation not

15
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,240
try to make anything happen not try to attain particular states of meditation

16
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,579
but rather the instruction was to wholeheartedly fully be present for what

17
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:57,659
is and um and so so uh there was a lot of physical effort

18
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,700
that went into into zen you had to show up early in the morning in the monastery like at four o'clock in the morning you

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,060
had to wake it up and to get up to do no effort at all

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,739
and then you had to uh take a very particular posture sit very straight and upright there's a lot of effort that

21
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:19,620
goes into the posture and um and then they ring the bell and then you have to do a walking meditation

22
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:26,400
to ring the bell you to come back to take this posture to do nothing in and so there's kind of nothing you do

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,420
but kind of a lot you do there's a lot of effort and in fact when I was practicing in the monastery in Japan

24
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:40,620
um I was admonished when I didn't make enough effort and they would say in Japan I had to do things with Zen

25
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,879
nochikara and that means with Zen power so so it was a little bit you know kind

26
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,519
of how I learned then and how I understood it was very peculiar maybe to myself but

27
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:00,420
um but it was clearly not striving not goal oriented and not trying to make anything happen just and I loved Zen and

28
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,739
I I put a lot of in retrospect I realized I put a lot of effort into it but it was kind of like the effort to

29
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,319
show up but the Mind wasn't trying to do anything it was almost like it was a

30
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,080
physical effort to show up for the present and physical was very important for me

31
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,140
because a lot of it was the embodied awareness that came in the embodied showing up

32
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,780
and the mind was just trying to be present but nothing else so no effort there

33
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,440
so that's how I defend myself a little bit or explain myself a little bit for skipping right effort

34
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,840
but um at some point I started appreciating as I kept studying day 12

35
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:50,159
path and looking at right effort and appreciating that actually I put a lot of effort into it and uh and I love the

36
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,420
effort I made and uh even when I went to uh Burma to practice vipassana there

37
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:03,659
there too the teacher made teachings about you should strive and some people really did themselves in

38
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:11,040
really suffered a lot because maybe with kind of Western acculturation striving meant stressing

39
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,799
and so people with stress and meditation which was not healthy and there were people who were kind of basket cases

40
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,880
from that approach but because I came from the Zen background when I heard strive I mostly

41
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,840
just Shrugged It Off and then I did that anyway in retrospect I wasn't striving to

42
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,560
attend anything but again once again I was really trying to wholeheartedly show up and be present for what is

43
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,280
which was the instructions and in the background it was for attaining something but I wasn't there

44
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:52,259
exactly to attain something I was there to show up fully and it was really wonderful for me the very detailed

45
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:58,139
precise instructions that I received in Burma in vipassana for doing this Zen

46
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:05,520
thing show up really precisely for the moment but in doing that it's set in motion an

47
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,680
unfolding a growth the development in practice that led to some of the states

48
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,720
that they're pointing to what you can attain but it wasn't like attaining it

49
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,300
wasn't the point for me it was kind of a byproduct so I felt I felt very lucky to have had

50
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,120
this background in Zen when I practiced with this Fierce uh teacher upadita in

51
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,160
Burma because I was protected in a way that a lot of other vipasto students

52
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:41,400
were not protected from the striving element that he had and um so uh so it took a while for me

53
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,500
to get my handle on this uh teravan of early Buddhist kind of idea of right effort

54
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:55,699
so to give you maybe maybe to kind of you could appreciate a little bit more the challenge I had to get behind it

55
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,160
um so right after it is made up of four different kind of practices or efforts

56
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,240
and whether we should call it effort or Endeavor some people translated four Endeavors the right Endeavor and maybe

57
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,919
that feels a little bit more relaxing I don't know but um it has to do with

58
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,080
recognizing the distinction between wholesome states of mind and unwholesome states of mind

59
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,259
unwholesome states of Mind are reactive qualities of the mind when we react uh

60
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,360
compulsively addictively to experience with anger with greed with hostility

61
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,360
with delusion with fear the unwholesome states of Mind are

62
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,020
always contain some degree of suffering of pain in them and that's what

63
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,780
qualifies them as a as unwholesome is they are detrimental to the person who

64
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:57,960
has them so uh so if you have anger which is not detrimental to you then it wouldn't be

65
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,000
considered unwholesome but the that's the definition of it in this tradition

66
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,080
so we have to be able to recognize what's on wholesome what's stressful what's detrimental and then there's what's wholesome which

67
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,840
is healthy and beneficial for the person who has it and these are mental States activities

68
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:24,599
of the mind that we do and so uh if there is an Impulse for generosity that has no conceit or no

69
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:30,419
greed or no ill will in it then it's wholesome but if it's mixed with these

70
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:37,620
unwholesome ones it kind of makes the generosity unwholesome as well so to be able to be generous to be

71
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,720
loving kind these are all kind of just part of many

72
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,780
many wholesome states of mind that we can have so that's the distinction in right

73
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:56,039
effort and um there's uh two two uh practices of

74
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:01,560
that invoid unwholesome states of mind and two for

75
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,199
wholesome the unholesome has to do with um first

76
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,720
if there's nothing unwholesome if you're not being in a reactive mode not caught

77
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,720
up in wholesome States then prevent them from coming occurring

78
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,680
so do what you can so they don't arise if they're if they have arise

79
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,319
then abandon them let go of them so the same distinction happens for

80
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:37,020
wholesome if there are a wholesome states that haven't arisen

81
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:42,300
evoke them if they've Arisen if they're there

82
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,760
then maintain them so that's the kind of a simple explanation for it

83
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,620
but in each of these four steps this is what you're supposed to do

84
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:01,560
and it is repeated for each one you should make effort arouse energy

85
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,980
exert your mind and strive to do each of those

86
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:15,600
so maybe now you can sympathize a little bit for my skipping right effort in my talk you're like what I mean this

87
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,600
is a little bit strong right now whether the English translation is accurate is uh you know you've always

88
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,200
questioned like the word strive is that really the right thing but anyway that's you know just four

89
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,839
words you know for for doing this so what but when four words are being used

90
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,300
like this what it does indicate is that for the Buddha

91
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:46,560
making some kind of effort is super important this is the Dharma is not for lazy

92
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,959
people the Dharma is not like you know to be easy going I'll get around to it

93
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:59,580
eventually and you know then I'll get I'll do some of it um and in particular for meditation

94
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:06,360
you know to sit down in meditation well I'm sit here for a while but I'll get around to being presents you know maybe near the end you know you know I have

95
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,720
some good I have some good fantasies I have to get through first they're mostly reruns but still I'm

96
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,260
gonna I want to go through them and but the idea I love the word word

97
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:25,620
wholehearted and for me the summary of all these powerful Expressions here is do your

98
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,899
practice wholeheartedly do it holy put yourself completely into it

99
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:36,779
but don't don't stress and then and uh and I'll talk about that

100
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:43,380
some more about this but don't do it wholeheartedly the Buddha really wants you don't be lazy be wholehearted give yourself to it

101
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,720
give yourself if you're going to practice give yourself over to it when you're practicing so like meditation

102
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:56,100
there's a peaceful way of giving yourself over to it a way a peaceful way that it doesn't cause more stress or

103
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:03,420
tension a wholehearted way that actually because the nature of the practice supports de-stressing

104
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:12,540
Letting Go relaxing tension so um so uh in in sometimes sometimes

105
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:18,000
these four right efforts are summarized by the four words

106
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,600
um prevent abandon evoke and maintain

107
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:31,500
that's nice nice thing to remember Maybe but it's uh but if you then if you look at the instructions a little bit more

108
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:38,100
carefully there's a I find this is fascinating and this is where that kind of came to realize the last few weeks

109
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:45,920
as I've been kind of seeing the teachings of the Buddha from a new slat the things that I overlooked before

110
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,560
and so sure enough it says um for unwholesome states that have been

111
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,260
arisen prevent them from arising and for ones that have Arisen abandon

112
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,740
them just so each one pages is one word but um

113
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,839
and for um for uh

114
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:19,079
for evoking wholesome states that have not yet Arisen it just says evoked them

115
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:26,600
bring them about bring them up somehow it's just one word but this is what I find fascinating is the fourth one

116
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:33,660
there are five words

117
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,440
to describe what you do here not just maintain so in this translation

118
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:48,500
it's Contin um make the effort for the continuance the

119
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:55,800
non-disappearance the strengthening the increase and the Fulfillment

120
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,440
by development by cultivation of those wholesome states that are

121
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,320
present that's a lot of words so the other were other I have just one

122
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,660
word but this has a so there's a kind of like wow now if you're chanting this in

123
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:19,800
the ancient world people chanted this it has a rhythm to it it has a heartfelt that has an embodied feeling to it that

124
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:26,160
I think has a my guess is in the ancient word had very different impact on people who sit down to read this and start

125
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,920
falling asleep because of these words of the repetition I mean these a lot of this Tech these

126
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,440
ancient texts are not very engaging to read if you're not if you're a novice

127
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,440
but um but if you're chanting it and you get the rhythm of the language and you're being carried Along by the Rhythm

128
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,320
I can imagine that this language of um it kind of almost suggests energy

129
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,899
suggests kind of a embodied feeling of kind of excitement or and then if you've

130
00:13:54,899 --> 00:14:01,980
chanted it a number of times and you heard it a number of times and you can it's like a refrain and you can get behind in Janet yourself there's

131
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:10,320
something that happens in chanting and communal chanting that there's a concentration and a location a deeper

132
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:19,320
resonance inside of us for what's being talked about so one awakens effort

133
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:25,380
uh for the continuance for the continuance

134
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:32,459
the non-disappearance the strengthening the increase the Fulfillment by cultivation

135
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:37,740
so by cultivate so anyway I don't know if this you get a sense of this Rhythm and the energy behind it and how it

136
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,880
might be conveyed in the ancient way in the way that this was originally meant to be presented

137
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:51,720
but what strikes me is that a couple of things is a

138
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:58,019
I think it's fair to say that this Buddhism thing that we do

139
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:03,240
is often associated with letting go isn't it kind of like non-attachment and

140
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,420
you have like you go to a you know a block party and people's you know it's kind of like the Hebrew Buddhist you're

141
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:15,720
doing Buddhist practice and you know that's like kind of party pooping you know just it's just about letting go and

142
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:22,380
you know it's about letting go and not attachment this non-attachment is overdone and you know my my wife when we

143
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:30,740
had a little baby went to an organization called um that Bay Area attachment parenting

144
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:36,420
so we're setting my you know parents my you know my wife and my son my little baby was going through this attachment

145
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:42,959
you know place and but attachment has a very different meaning in Psychology these days where

146
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:49,320
it's a healthy kind of sense of bonding and connection that's a very important and but to boot for Buddhist attachment

147
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:55,560
is all bad in Buddhist English and so so that's we

148
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,720
have Buddhism has that reputation but it does does not have the reputation

149
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,860
for what we're supposed to do with these wholesome States um and the you know to increase them to

150
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:13,920
strengthen them to expand them to develop them once they've Arisen make them have them

151
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,560
grow and we find out and elsewhere in these ancient texts where it actually uses the

152
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:26,940
word to to grow the wholesome States to the point that they're abundant

153
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:33,660
that we Thrive with them that uh we're filled with them they fully flow through

154
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:39,480
us the word for fulfill kind of actually means to fit be filled out by them

155
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:45,959
fully and that's kind of dramatic and then you know the Zen person in me

156
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:52,560
the way I was taught then kind of reacts as well wait a minute we're supposed to be prioritizing certain states of mind

157
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,980
we should just be with the way things are and accept it for what it is and the idea that you prioritize certain states

158
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:05,699
of mind you know that was kind of like you know if you go to your Zen migrant to my zen teacher and say you know wow I

159
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:10,860
just got really concentrated or really felt peaceful or filled with joy in my

160
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:17,839
meditation uh we I'd be lucky if the teacher said something like well just one more thing to let go of

161
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,819
and uh and then sometimes it was worse and uh in Zen they have something called

162
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:29,419
makko I think it's makio which is um

163
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:35,039
you know anyway it means delusion it just kind of you know it's just illusion

164
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:41,280
don't bother with it and so this dismissing of these beautiful wholesome States makes sense

165
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:48,299
in a certain cert in the in the in the um in the approach of Zen I want to be

166
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:55,620
respectful for it it really makes sense in the grand totality of what's in practice is about It's very effective if

167
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:02,640
you really understand the purpose and the background for it but it also when I it lends someone like

168
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:10,740
me to read these kinds of texts and be dismissive of it or not be interested but at the same time when I did

169
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:17,520
vipassana practice how do I do it these beautiful States arise

170
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,820
and they're allowed to rise they're supposed to arise sitting in meditation and allowing

171
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:30,960
yourself to feel deeply calm deeply content deeply at home being here right now in

172
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:38,220
such a way that it's kind of an embodied at home in this feeling that comes sometimes with delight and

173
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,940
joy and happiness and a settleness of the mind gets really

174
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,679
stilled and unified and peaceful their mind gets the I was really

175
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,200
surprised to discover the upwelling in meditation for the first time of a very

176
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,780
powerful states of loving-kindness of compassion of equanimity

177
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:08,220
that arose and so these things are supposed to be allowed and grow and develop

178
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:14,580
and and some of the faults were not recognizing this early on is that the a

179
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:21,539
lot of the early English translators flattened the Pali language into English

180
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:28,620
they kind of made it I think they maybe they were distrustful of a lot of emotionality and you know flowery kind

181
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:34,580
of language or evocative language and so some of the more beautiful and inspiring

182
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,660
discuss words like thriving uh the word

183
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:50,100
thriving became increase and uh and abundance became

184
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,200
uh like you know frequent or Lots or you know something

185
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,679
you know you know has very different emotional tone or feeling the words you choose and I think we kind of flattened

186
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,260
it in these English translation and um and so but when you start getting

187
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:12,480
this language of abundance and thriving you get a very different feeling for

188
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,620
what fills us what can happen what's possible it's also possible to hear these and

189
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:25,380
compare oneself and say well these aren't happening to me so then I'm bad or wrong or it's

190
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:31,980
supposed to be different it's also possible to think that you know well I have to strive now to attain

191
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:38,460
these and huff and puff and try to hold on to it and so there's a lot of detrimental reactivity that can come

192
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:45,419
into play when we hear about these things but that's why these four right efforts are needed together

193
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:52,500
and we need to understand them together because if we mix wrong effort

194
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:58,980
with right effort we end up with wrong effort and so if you hear that you're supposed

195
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:05,039
to develop qualities of joy and happiness and practice that that's supposed to come up

196
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,799
but we do it with with the clinging and attachment then it doesn't help it

197
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,919
doesn't work so um so one of the examples I like to

198
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,980
give for the kind of proper striving if you were into that kind of thing

199
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:29,580
is strive to be relaxed thanks

200
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,700
and if you try to if that's you strive to be relaxed that's a protection

201
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:41,340
because you can't strive with tension and relax at the

202
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:46,679
same time if the purpose is to relax the striving has to be wholehearted has to

203
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:52,020
be diligent it has to be kind of continuous really stay on it on top of it

204
00:21:52,020 --> 00:22:00,120
but in staying on top of it it's you're saying you're getting more and more relaxed you're discovering the places within where there's tension just to

205
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:06,780
relax and in fact elsewhere the Buddha talks about the first stages of meditation has

206
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:12,960
a lot to do with relaxing calming our reactivity

207
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,240
and the in the kind of stages of meditation that he gives

208
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,760
it's not until there's been a fair amount of relaxation of reactivity

209
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,700
that we begin getting into the realm of maintaining cultivating and maintaining

210
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:37,080
and growing and with these wonderful positive states of mind that can arise

211
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,919
and um and so we learn to relax the body that Buddha said the reactivity that's

212
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,200
stored in our body for someone who's new to meditation this is one of the first

213
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:56,400
things that's really useful to do really really find a way to sit and meditate so the shoulders can relax the

214
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,460
belly can relax that the muscles of the face really work on sitting upright or

215
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:08,039
the equivalent for you and let let things really unwind

216
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:13,980
don't be in a hurry to jump over that stage of a practice

217
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:21,360
and then uh and then the second instruction is to do that for the mind for the mental World whatever is a

218
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:28,380
reactive intense in your mental world that's important to come to try and make

219
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:35,539
tranquil to settle to relax and so this is a very important

220
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:42,780
protective measure in this practice is to remember how important it is to relax

221
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:48,960
so then we take this instruction here which says

222
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,900
you should make effort arouse energy exert your mind and strive

223
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,500
to relax

224
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:06,000
do it wholeheartedly really give yourself to it but you know don't if you

225
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,780
do it give yourself to it wholeheartedly remember to do it as a way of relaxing

226
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:20,640
and then at some point with enough relaxation and enough being fully present here and this is not an

227
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,120
easy thing to come to and many people find meditation phenomenally beneficial just because it

228
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,460
gets real helps them relax 10 percent of their attention and they're 10 more

229
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:39,360
here and more wiser because of it but at some point when there's enough relaxation of our reactivity the

230
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,900
reactive world that we're caught in and living in these beneficial States the wholesome

231
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:53,940
states begin appearing on their own they're not something we have to manufacture or require but rather

232
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:59,400
there's kind of like almost like the nature of who we are is waiting inside of us

233
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:06,320
are our our states of calm peace generosity

234
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,340
care love Equanimity wisdom

235
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:17,100
joy happiness that are just kind of like in the you know

236
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:23,299
you know just off stage just waiting for a chance to come on stage when just those reactive

237
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:28,559
actors can just get off but you know that the reactive actors

238
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:35,659
are there all the time and so they never seem to they think they have an endless encore

239
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:41,340
and um but finally when they settle away and there's room on the stage of our mind our heart

240
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:46,820
there's all the stuff that can arise and what this teaching here means for me

241
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:54,360
of you know support the continuous the maintaining of it the strengthening it the development of it the abundance of

242
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,460
it has a lot to do with allowing it to do so

243
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:06,299
getting out of the way and this is one of the things I learned from this way I was practicing was how

244
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:13,380
useful it was to get out of my own way and kind of make room for these things I'll make space for them which comes

245
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:19,860
from appreciating them and it took a long time for me to appreciate these positive states of mind

246
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:27,480
that can arise out of meditation out of Buddhist practice they Rose for me but I kind of shrugged

247
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,539
them off or didn't pay any attention to him because of this Zen background where we weren't supposed to

248
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:38,580
and but eventually I learned oh you're this is okay to appreciate these

249
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:45,000
it's okay to make room for them and value them because doing that is the very thing that supports them to grow

250
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,760
more and more and more if you don't appreciate them they don't grow

251
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:58,500
if you get attached to them they don't grow if you tie them if you connect them to

252
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:06,179
your self-worth they don't grow just let them be let them be there and

253
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:12,600
support and grow and develop and don't make them complicated get out of the way for them don't interfere with them but

254
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,820
then do the things that support them and some of that that supports these is

255
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:24,480
the wholeheartedly showing up and being present for what is and when the host of states of Mind

256
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,000
begin showing themselves maybe as small hints at first to be wholeheartedly

257
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,480
present for those in making room for them gives room for them to grow and develop

258
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:45,240
and um and then we come to a point in practice some point not an easy thing but uh it is kind of

259
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:51,659
the North Star that we kind of know that's possible is that we come to a point where the

260
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:58,559
thriving the sense of abundance and sort of thriving that is possible uh embodied

261
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,840
thriving embodied abundance body sense of wholeness of nourishment seems to

262
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:11,340
begin having a life of its own it seems to be welled up and be present and support us in being present and it

263
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:17,159
creates a context a background a foundation

264
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,620
for being present for all kinds of things including our reactivity including what's really difficult in

265
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:29,760
this world that that is such a powerful support

266
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,600
to be supported by deep relaxation by Joy by Happiness by a sense of calm so

267
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,240
we can address the difficulties of this life of ours is very different than

268
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:49,500
meeting the difficulties of this life from that place of reactivity from the place of unwholesomeness that many

269
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:57,900
people are caught up in so with all that I want to read an ancient poem

270
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,720
and it's a what's here

271
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:11,240
I think it's written by a disciple of the Buddha from the ancient world rather than by the Buddha

272
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:20,760
so in sense what we're talking about today is the distinction between also between wise and unwise attention

273
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:27,299
so unwise attention doesn't know what to pay attention to properly and also pays attention to ways that

274
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:33,899
maybe involve attachment or clinging or resistance or aversion um

275
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:39,299
so this poem begins with a sentence from unwise attention

276
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:47,460
your thoughts eat you what do you think of that none of you of

277
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:53,840
course there apparently the the Pali word might literally mean chew you up

278
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:01,679
I'm building more than just a little more dramatic than eating so this ancient uh it's a text you know it's

279
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,919
very poetic and powerful the words they have been kind of flattened in English and so sometimes you know even the

280
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,960
negative ones are very kind of but you see

281
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:23,760
from unwise attention your thoughts eat you giving up what is unwise think wisely

282
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,480
basing your thoughts on the Buddha Dharma Sangha and your own virtue

283
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:37,080
you will no doubt obtain gladness joy and happiness

284
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:47,159
then with abundant gladness you will make an end to suffering

285
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:53,460
so here you see a shift from language here from something unwholesome

286
00:30:53,460 --> 00:31:00,299
unhelpful unwise attention we learn how to pay attention wisely

287
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:07,500
and to think wisely so that our thoughts don't eat us up don't you know pull us into their Whirlpool of

288
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:13,980
preoccupation and then basing ourselves on the values

289
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:19,620
the orientation in life that the Buddha Dharma Sangha represents

290
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:25,860
and virtue your own ethics you will no doubt

291
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:31,320
obtain gladness joy and happiness so here's the emphasis on these

292
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:37,260
wholesome healthy qualities of Mind our hearts and then here it talks about abundance

293
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:43,919
with abundant gladness imagine this language of abundance is used

294
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:50,059
sometimes kind of another way to talk about it they talk about uh

295
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:56,779
inner wealth that faith is inner wealth

296
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:04,919
uh vigilance and kind of careful attention is an inner wealth

297
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:11,279
loving kindness is an inner wealth so the idea of becoming wealthy abundant

298
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:19,140
likes of spilling over you have more than enough you feel completely you know content and happy

299
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:24,380
and then you will make an end of suffering

300
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:33,179
maybe your suffering won't come to an end until you've figured out a way to

301
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:41,940
relax deeply to allow some really beautiful qualities of heart to arise

302
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:50,299
and so you can really then from that point of view address the root of the suffering that you have in your life

303
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:58,740
so that was a little plug for right effort maybe trying to make up for 25 years ago

304
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:06,000
and when I skipped it so thank you and um so we have a few

305
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,760
minutes if some of you would like to ask uh questions or comments and you're welcome to do that

306
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,820
let's head north over there yes

307
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:33,600
thank you uh thank you very much that was very

308
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:41,940
provocative for me many things swirling around inside me I want to add

309
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:47,039
that in that place as I've acknowledged

310
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,919
over time the wholesome thoughts if you will the positive States The Joy the the

311
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:58,799
higher vibration if you will I feel very much that I work with that

312
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,320
idea of what nurtures it what how do I resource it because we're also in our

313
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:11,580
human being bodies and um my profession is a therapist so as I

314
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:17,280
was listening to you it was diffic it was unavoidable to not

315
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,378
think about how we live out here externally

316
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:29,099
practically what do we do what choices do we make to feed those states of mind and just the one thing I wanted to share

317
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:35,638
that got me very excited was when you spoke about how do we grow those

318
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:44,820
wholesome States and what came to me was express it create service Love Love More

319
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:50,460
here and here and so thank you you fed me deeply today

320
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,740
great thank you that's very nice yeah I think if there are these wholesome

321
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:01,400
Tendencies or qualities that are in US they grow by expressing them

322
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,480
especially if we express them wisely you know not just you know inflict

323
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:13,200
people with them but uh the wise expression of it and and

324
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,079
the relational are so important because one of the most common if someone you didn't ask me correctly but if one of

325
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:25,619
the someone asked me you know how do you make these grow or these wholesome States the most common answer the

326
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:31,320
tuition gives is um has to do with how we live interrelationally with other people they

327
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,599
say you should be ethical you practice your ethics and generosity ethics is all

328
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:41,640
about how we live in relationship to other people and others other things and

329
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:48,180
generosity is same thing it's an interrelational world that we're that is so important for all this and and

330
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:53,940
sometimes because it's a meditation tradition we had and we close our eyes in our

331
00:35:53,940 --> 00:36:01,980
tradition even right it just seems like it's so self-focused internally focused but but a lot of this work also happens

332
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:08,359
interrelationally in just ethics and generosity is the beginning of it

333
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:11,359
so someone else

334
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:40,140
um thank you for your comments and um

335
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:45,420
the session today I wondered if

336
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:52,320
you have tried to teach or you have taught meditation to four to five year

337
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,599
old students to you know the and what your

338
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:06,240
ex I mean to more higher ages maybe 9 10 to 11 12 13 14. I've been trying to

339
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,180
teach like five minutes meditation when I have been teaching last few weeks and

340
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:20,220
just to see how they absorb being able to close their eyes and feel

341
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:28,400
you know the generosity and the wholesomeness of relationships

342
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:39,500
um I don't haven't had a lot of experience a lot of I haven't had a lot of experience with four to five year olds

343
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:46,460
and I think that for that age and for even older some of the ways of being

344
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:53,420
that adults want to see them adults want to have kids kind of

345
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:58,920
be positively influenced by meditation so it can be different in some kind of

346
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:06,000
way but I think some of the ways we want them to be different or be changed or be supported or be guided or I don't know

347
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,599
something there might be better ways in trying to get them to meditate

348
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:17,579
there might be how how parents conduct themselves slowly over the you know

349
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:22,920
regularly becomes a model for how they learn to be present and be relaxed the

350
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,020
parents are anxious they learn that the world is a scary place if they alert If

351
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:33,300
the parents are happy they learn the world's a happy place to be so how the parents are at that age is

352
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:40,440
probably more important when my kids were that age there was one one I have two sons and one of them did

353
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,960
a lot of meditation with but that wasn't because um you know I you know I thought it was

354
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,420
I don't know how to say it the main reason for doing it is that um uh he was

355
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:59,578
kind of a hyper active kid like you know not that kind of and

356
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:08,760
um and so uh and the more tired he got the more activated he would get which

357
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,839
wasn't healthy for him because that he couldn't sleep and so getting him to sleep was a big issue like it was a little baby we could

358
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:22,260
only get him to sleep if we carried him or drove him in the car you know for naps

359
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,780
and so I started doing guided meditations for him going to bed at night and that would help him go to

360
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:33,260
sleep and um and so I did a lot of creative imagine

361
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:39,359
visualizations or imaginations for him like imagine that he was a sea otter on

362
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,640
its back on the ocean on top floating on top of the kelp and the gentle waves are

363
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:51,540
coming and lifting you up and down and and so your breath up and down of the waves and he would lay there and imagine

364
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:57,900
he was a sea otter or a bird or I did all these animals you know it's like every evening was a

365
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:05,339
different animal for a long time and that would so he had that and what How Deeply that went into

366
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:11,040
him I don't know the other thing that we did with the kids were that young is

367
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,800
um uh we had cookie parties

368
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,740
and a cookie party was uh a time where sometimes we did it because it was it

369
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:29,838
was with two kids at home things were you know I didn't know that people literally bounced off the walls

370
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:36,660
I thought it was just just an expression and so there were times when it just

371
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:42,599
like was you know not only bouncing off the walls they're going to bounce through the window soon so we we need

372
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:48,839
something here so let's have a cookie party and uh and they knew what that meant so

373
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:56,339
we would they would get involved in setting it up and we'd set up a kind of special kind of rug on the floor and and

374
00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:02,940
they get a little kind of flower or centerpiece maybe a Buddha and then we put zuff who's like we have here sitting

375
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:09,720
on around four of them for the four or you know in each corner of a kind of a circle and then we get cookies out and

376
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:16,440
put them on a plate and maybe some milk for the kids and then we would sit there my wife and I would sit in meditation

377
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,800
posture and they would sit on those offers in the way that they do and everything could calmed down

378
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:27,480
everything's settled and got peaceful and there was no meditation but there

379
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:34,079
was a Ambiance the tone the how the kids felt and what was going on for them maybe they I don't know what was going

380
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:40,140
on when they were activated but when they but they you know they and then after they had this cookie party they

381
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:45,480
were so calm and contented and cozy and it was such a you know it you know

382
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,880
whatever a parent wants a four-year-old to get for meditation

383
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,180
we got from cookie cookie parties so that's a I could say more but that's

384
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:04,560
enough for now and uh and I think adults do well maybe not cookie parties but now we call them

385
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:10,140
tea ceremonies it says are just looking at our

386
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:15,660
teammaster so um

387
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:21,180
okay so thank you so if some of you would like to meet outside now in the parking lot we can take some folding

388
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:28,740
chairs out and we can take the masks off there and have more discussion for a little while and be nice to hang out and

389
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:32,660
otherwise thank you
