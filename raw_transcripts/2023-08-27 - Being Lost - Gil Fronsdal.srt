1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:07,500
I spent a good part of the summer in the wilderness or the edges of the

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,099
Wilderness play places and recently I was a one one uh

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,320
place where there was some people who are quite skilled and had Wilderness

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:27,060
skills and they were going to help some of the people who didn't have much skills talk about you know how to navigate in

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,239
the wilderness and and so one of the skills is what to do when you're lost

6
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:41,820
and so I want to talk about and then later there's a friend who's studied with a indigenous

7
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:49,140
person in Canada and Indigenous person herself and she

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,500
told the story of her Elder finding someone who was lost a boy who

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,620
was lost this story really had a big impact on her and helped and really had a big impact

10
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,320
on her Buddhist Meditation practice so so this idea of lost has come to my mind

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,780
so I thought and I think not a few it's not so far not such a stretch to think

12
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,080
about how in this as a metaphor being lost for how people are confused or lost

13
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,360
or not don't know how to find their way in their life in their lives

14
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,400
it can be lost in relationships confused uncertain what do we do now

15
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:37,799
it could be in a sense of purpose in life or work it could be in in oneself once identity

16
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:45,000
once what's important for one what's what are we supposed to do it can be lost with our emotional lives emotional

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,840
lives are quite difficult and often not obviously rational or

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,740
obviously therefore a clear reason that we can address so some people feel lost in their emotional life and so this idea

19
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,140
of being lost I think is a um in some way or other is a common

20
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,539
human phenomenon so these two stories that I've been living with about being

21
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:17,340
lost I think might be a nice reference point so the Wilderness guides a guide who is

22
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:24,500
telling people what to do when they're lost is explained that the best thing you can do if you as soon as you're lost

23
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,300
stop stand still in the wilderness the people who get really lost in the

24
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,060
wilderness and they are not found easily are the ones who kind of stumble along trying to find their way and keep going

25
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,459
and they don't know their way and they end up going deeper and deeper into the Wilderness and places where maybe it

26
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,560
doesn't occur to others to find them but if you stop as soon as you're lost

27
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,540
then you're relatively close maybe to a place where other people go or where people think you've gone or something

28
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:00,660
so the idea of stop and be still and that's counterintuitive because you're lost it's dangerous you have to do

29
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:08,400
something and so let's keep going let's keep searching or something but this emphasis was really stand still

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,099
in weight and um and someone you know if someone will find you especially if they know

31
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:20,700
you're out in the wilderness we didn't tell anyone that's you know that's not a that's a sign of

32
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:26,220
not being skilled in Wilderness either so

33
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,819
um so the um and so this idea of standing still when

34
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:38,400
you're lost I think is quite a wonderful thing in life in general and one of the

35
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,599
things that standing still does and what it's a metaphor for is not to keep going not to keep spinning

36
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,659
and in the wilderness uh if you stop and stand still maybe there's opportunity to

37
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:56,879
relax to settle to catch your breath begin looking around in the environment

38
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,940
what's going on here and and people who panic when they get lost don't think

39
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:10,140
very well don't study their environment very well but if you stop and stand still then all

40
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,560
the surface tension all that kind of extra stuff that we add on top of the situation has a chance to settle

41
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,079
and if you have a med if you have a meditation practice maybe even you sit down and meditate for a while to really

42
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,320
let the surface all the extra agitation emotion spinning of the Mind fear subtle

43
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:36,060
enough so when you open your eyes maybe you can look at the situation more clearly and you notice oh it's kind of it's kind

44
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,580
of quiet and uh now I can hear better and quietly in the distance I hear that

45
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,800
River you know the river that's where I came from I crossed the

46
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,919
river and I know I know the direction of it but you had to be quiet enough to hear it

47
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:59,040
and um or it's quiet enough to think oh there's a Hilltop just really close by I

48
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,639
wonder if I go to there and look get the kind of the overview of the place maybe I'll have a better sense of where I came

49
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,400
from or what's the direction to go and so just being calm settling down is

50
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,580
powerful in all kinds of places when we're in feel like lost in our lives and

51
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:24,600
one of the things that does is stopping whatever we do stop and be still meditate maybe is what we're beginning

52
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,080
to shed or allowing to settle away is all the stuff that is extra that's not

53
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:38,880
needed that gets in the way of our Clarity our wisdom our kind of seeing you know what the valuable

54
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:46,500
landmarks there might be for us to find our way and um so a big part of what meditation

55
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:53,820
practice can do Mindless practice do is not what it gives us but what it helps us to let go of what

56
00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:01,199
we shed from it which if if in fact we're agitated afraid caught up in what's going on

57
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,979
spinning then um you know at shed all the stuff that's extra from some kind of clear seeing

58
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:13,620
and this happened to me I wasn't lost physically but I was in the wilderness

59
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,680
when I had this I was living in a Wilderness Monastery Buddhist Monastery so I spent a lot of time walking in the

60
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,259
mountains and by myself and we had days off in the monastery so

61
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:32,880
that's when I went walking in the world in the wilderness and and sometimes on Trails sometimes off trails but uh the

62
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,560
first year in the monastery a lot of what I did during these days law days off was be kind of miserable

63
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,740
because uh that's when I was left alone enough to start thinking about what am I going to do with this life of mine

64
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,319
you know and we should what should I do I I'd been accepted to graduate school and I

65
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:59,180
contact the graduate school and told them that something important it kind of came up had come up and could I please

66
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,979
defer for a year what I didn't tell them that the one important thing that came up was I was

67
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:11,220
going to a Buddhist monastery and um they said sure So I knew they was

68
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,259
waiting for me this the question should I go to graduate school and and um and

69
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:22,319
it was it was a graduate program to do some be of service to the world and what I thought was an important way

70
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,900
and so this idea of being a service that seems almost like should I do that they said okay to do that and where my

71
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:34,080
motivation's accurate is this the right thing to do should I continue in Buddhism and you know what should I do

72
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,840
with my life and so I was in my 20s and it and was wondering what did what to do

73
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,620
and and so because I did couldn't figure it out then I had a lot of doubts about myself and doubts about my ability to

74
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,900
choose I was lost and I was confused and I was miserable and that you know with

75
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,479
all this how I was and um and so this went on for long you

76
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:04,740
know many many months and at some point I was on some trail the height doing this usual usual kind

77
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:11,280
of kind of rumination usual kind of kind of questioning myself wondering what to do

78
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,039
and I said Gil I said to myself you're spending a lot of time and more

79
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,860
and more time in your imagination of things other places and other times

80
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,280
what you're going to do in the future and where at some place where that might be where I might go do that

81
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,979
and I said you know this is just your imagination it's not actually what's

82
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,620
happening what would happen or whatever I made it I realized it was I felt I felt kind of

83
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,959
hopeless after all these months of this kind of reflection and thinking and I didn't I

84
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:51,000
feel like I didn't feel like I couldn't find an answer anymore that way

85
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,260
and so I made a decision to be still I mean I think I still walked on the trail but uh to just start

86
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:04,140
and to really stop all this movement of the mind and Imagination and doubting and all that

87
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:10,980
and um and just take the next step just show up for the next thing that was

88
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:17,160
there so on this Trail The Next Step was literally The Next Step and it was time to get back to the

89
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,800
monastery so that's and you get back to the monastery there it's all choreographed they ring a bell and you

90
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,760
have to go meditate you know ring another Bell and you go eat and all this stuff so so I was really lucky that I

91
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,580
made this decision just start my it was it literally was the decision was to start my life over

92
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:42,000
and I don't know maybe it's kind of naive to think you can do that but uh but I'm naive sometimes that's okay

93
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,440
and sort of serves me sometimes and so I said I said okay I'm going to start over and but to start over in the

94
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,700
Buddhist Monastery that's kind of unusual I feel so lucky that that's where it was because then you know the next thing

95
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:03,600
that I had to do you know the next step was the bell rang you have to go meditate what a great thing to do and uh

96
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:11,220
and and then next thing was to go do the work they have to do and and living that monastic life and so that just kept

97
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,380
opening the doors and in some very real way for me my life did start over again

98
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:23,700
at that point but because I started in a monastery that really kind of informed how my life

99
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:30,540
then unfolded as it opened up step by step and now I'm here with you because

100
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:36,180
of that choice so that's not so bad is it no I think it's great

101
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,180
and um so so this kind of being still stopping

102
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:49,260
some kind of rumination sometimes a spinning of the mind some kind of spinning and doubts

103
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:56,279
and emotions learning how to quiet all this so that we can see differently so we can

104
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:02,579
start fresh so we can you know maybe some different decision will come that cannot come when we're all spinning

105
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:08,940
around when we're lost and I think this is true in relationships too it's so easy in

106
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:16,019
relationships to be spinning and agitated and Afraid and and angry and doubtful and all kinds of

107
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:22,200
things but to really learn to stop and be still is maybe sometimes essential in

108
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,140
relationships maybe not in the moment when it's difficult but maybe if the relationship is going to last for some

109
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:34,500
time maybe you'll find some way to kind of really come and stop and be still and

110
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,720
let the agitated mind agitated heart quiet enough so that something different

111
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,899
can happen some different seeing and so what's a different thing that can

112
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:52,980
happen so this is the second story now that uh from this um indigenous

113
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:59,760
person in Canada so he had spent a lot of time in the

114
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:09,420
wilderness in the woods working and living and uh and at some point there was

115
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:15,839
where he where he had been his kind of Homeland or place of it became a

116
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,720
national park in Canada so he continued being there and and at some point there was a young boy

117
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:28,920
I don't know how old he was maybe I don't know pretty young who got lost and the people in the park the Rangers

118
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:37,019
and stuff spent two days looking for him and they couldn't find him so they went to this man Jim City and

119
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:44,459
said can you help and so he said take me to where the boy last place of the boy was seen

120
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:49,680
so he went there and I took him there and then he stood

121
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,980
in that spot for half an hour without moving he stood still maybe just studying the spot

122
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,740
and then um he said it this way and he started walking into the woods

123
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,079
and he just followed had some sense of where to go and he

124
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:13,980
went for some time I think he I think he went alone and um and at some point he came to some

125
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:21,300
place where he stopped and he um he said he hollered and uh and then something hollered back

126
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:27,899
right there next to him and it was the boy but the boy was petrified

127
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:33,180
so what he did was he just sat down next to the boy and it took about a half an hour for the

128
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:38,459
boy to thaw and calm down to be able to somehow carve a conversation and be

129
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:44,100
ready for something next and then he brought him back to the world

130
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:50,880
and and then he talked about that experience later and how did you manage with that and he said well every living

131
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:57,240
being is unique and you have to kind of find what's the unique thing about

132
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,360
whatever whoever it is whatever it is whatever creature and then you can maybe follow them and what he was talking

133
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,399
about was the boy had unique footprints and he knew about the footprints of all

134
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,339
the animals of the woods so he knew how to differentiate and so that's apparently standing there half an hour

135
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:20,880
one of the things he was doing was looking around seeing what is the footprint of this boy like and then he

136
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,880
started following the traces of the footprints that he could find through the woods

137
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:34,680
and uh and uh and then he found the boy and this this thing about just again stopping and being still with the boy

138
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:41,399
accompanying the boy so the boy could kind of begin to in two days in the wilderness you imagine he was terrified

139
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:46,800
and so that boy could kind of relax and calm down enough to be able to come

140
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,139
along so um so my friend then took this story

141
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:57,360
that was very impactful for her and and applied it to her meditation

142
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,899
that uh she when she's lost she has to stop and be still and then search for

143
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:10,620
the trail the traces in herself to find a way forward

144
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:18,540
and one of the ways to do that that I find very helpful for me in my meditation is to be quiet enough and

145
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:24,839
then to ask myself the question um what is what what inside of me is

146
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,240
asking for attention what inside of me is calling for

147
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,480
attention or is inviting me or welcoming me my attention

148
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,019
so rather than me having some idea I'm supposed to pay attention to something and and sometimes I've done that in a

149
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:50,040
very assertive way you know I'm by golly I'm going to get concentrated here I'm just going to zoom in you know or I'm

150
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,380
going to get rid of this pain I'm going to do just the Bazooka approach to the grenade approach to mindfulness it's

151
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:03,420
going to go in there and just blast it away I mean that's not a very good approach to mindfulness but the idea of being

152
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:09,959
still and quiet and then asking what wants attention what's inviting me in

153
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:16,680
and uh and often for me when I begin meditation it's my breathing

154
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:23,579
but it's a very different relationship to breathing when I'm Still Still and quiet and ask what is this that invites

155
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:29,880
me and then and then um and then it's like

156
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,820
trade now that I've been invited what is the tracks I'm following

157
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:43,019
uh and so the idea of them following something is very different than the idea that I'm trying to make something

158
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:49,560
happen I'm trying to build something I'm trying to attain something it's more like again I I don't I'm not

159
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm not the one who is has designs of what's supposed to happen I'm not the one who is

160
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,440
you know trying to get something for myself

161
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,819
but there's there's a track to follow the track of the invitation that the tracks of what's calling or what's

162
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:14,459
that's inviting me to to follow itself and so then I'll tune in to the breath

163
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:20,459
and and it's more like okay I'm I'm the tracker or I'm the visitor or I'm the

164
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,558
the person who reads the invitations like this here here

165
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:31,740
and so so there's a track inside and uh there's you know that we follow

166
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:37,500
and sometimes it's the breathing sometimes it's Sensations in the body sometimes it's emotions sometimes the

167
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:46,080
state of the mind sometimes the content of the Mind the thoughts that I might be having but there's a sense that that I'm not so

168
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,620
much in charge I'm more in charge of the tracking of listening for the invitation

169
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,900
so I do have a role but uh but I'm learning learning how to

170
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:03,900
read the traces inside of myself and just like this uh Elder said that

171
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:09,360
you know every living creature is unique so each of each moment for us each day

172
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,480
that we show up for ourselves we're kind of unique our inner life is unique and what is it

173
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,720
let's discover what it is each time rather than come with a preconceived idea of what it is

174
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:28,260
and many people come with preconceived ideas some people come with um like I did when I was walking those

175
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,600
trails in the outside the monastery I showed up with preconceived ideas about

176
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:40,820
my inability to decide what to do for myself my life big decision in my life that I I'm just a

177
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:47,000
condemned to being a doubter and that's so I showed up I already showed up with you know

178
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,340
in a challenging way with a preconceived idea that I couldn't do this

179
00:18:53,340 --> 00:19:00,000
and um but is that really listening to the invitation certainly listening to what's asking to what's called for

180
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,580
no you have to kind of figure out how to stop and be still enough so that you can

181
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,919
see in a fresh way not to carry with you your Prejudice your preconceived ideas

182
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:16,880
your bias your all kinds of things so stop and be still

183
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:24,000
so the Buddha uh is you know well there's a wonderful analogy that Buddha gives

184
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,520
that has to do with being in the woods and finding something and the analogy is

185
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,460
not a is about a wood a woodworker someone who worked in the woods Forester

186
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:41,160
who wasn't lost but spend time a lot of time

187
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:47,700
in the forest but found that the tracks the traces of an ancient

188
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:53,580
Road the jungle had overgrown and but he found the traces the person's forced to

189
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:59,640
found the traces and Then followed the traces and very slowly and and uh clear a

190
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,640
little bit and follow traces and it came to some great ancient capital city that

191
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:12,660
had been fully overgrown like the maybe like the cities they're fine still finding in uh on the Mayan peninsula in

192
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:19,740
Mexico or something that um that is amazing we're still finding this long-lost cities that have been

193
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:25,020
overgrown and um and then the Buddha that this

194
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:30,419
with this Forester then leaves the leaves the the force and goes to the monarchs of

195
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:36,120
the of the of the realm and tells them you know we I found this ancient Road

196
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,940
traces of it I found the the this ancient capital and so the monarchs are

197
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:49,020
happy and they arrange for the road to be cleared they range for the capital be declared and they all move back into the

198
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:56,520
Happy Ever After Capital something like that and um so it's an out it's an allegory

199
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,860
it's a metaphor that and it's meant to be a metaphor for yourself

200
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:08,700
that the ancient capital is our own freedom our own capacity to find a place where

201
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:16,080
the heart is free of its distress its troubles its suffering a liberated heart

202
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:23,580
but to do that we have the the path that exists that's overgrown is the path in

203
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:30,179
ourselves and um and the path that was overgrown is with attachments with clinging with

204
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:36,539
fears with anxieties with with uh hatred and condemnations and for his

205
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:43,799
resentments and all kinds of things that grow and grow over a lifetime and for some people these can grow unabated

206
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:49,440
without any any limitation just keep growing and

207
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,500
growing so by the time we reach a certain age kind of something like in us has been

208
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,720
overgrown so thoroughly we don't even know that the inside of us is this

209
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,419
wonderful Capital this wonderful place this wonderful home this wonderful kind

210
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:14,820
of place of being safe being found and so this invitation or this way of

211
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,980
practicing where we're assume I'm going to follow the traces of what is asking

212
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:27,059
for attention right now it doesn't mean rumination it doesn't mean keep okay thinking about things and

213
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:33,659
thinking more and more and more it's being still being quiet though

214
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:40,860
enough to listen to something deeper than thoughts or listen to the what lies

215
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:48,659
underneath your thoughts and to listen quietly and then then oh

216
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:54,000
it's my breathing oh there's my heartache oh there's a tightness in my

217
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,760
belly oh there's a lot of energy and agitation and thinking

218
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:06,419
that kind of wants my attention let me hold that and be with that and then what it what now wants

219
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:12,480
attention maybe more of the same or look at that it's beginning to calm down

220
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:20,280
that calming seems to want attention it seems to call me it seems to be you know and then we stay with that and then

221
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:27,080
slowly we find our way and uh and in the Dharma and the the

222
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:35,000
what the the way that we found we find is the a big part of it is that we discover

223
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,200
that the path itself is so precious

224
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:46,440
it's so wonderful to have a path of practice that getting to the Capitol may be a

225
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:53,460
secondary but just the fact that we and following a path like this is an expression of

226
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:59,640
freedom is a manifestation of our freedom maybe not initially but as we keep doing it

227
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,820
and keep showing up and being Mindful and being mindful of what's here we start seeing that the act of mindfulness

228
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:11,039
is an act of freedom meaning an act of mindfulness means

229
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:17,340
we're no longer caught up in that moment caught in our preoccupations caught in

230
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:25,380
our emotions caught in our past or caught in the future cotton or whatever it might be

231
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:31,140
we don't deny all those things but we're not caught in it wow

232
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:37,679
this is what's happening there's Freedom here and so as we keep doing this movement of

233
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,620
being still and quiet enough to have the mindfulness be full

234
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:49,260
where mindfulness can be there together with its freedom then we begin appreciating more and more

235
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:54,780
that simply the being on the path of doing this

236
00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:00,120
is something to celebrate it's a refuge and some people will find

237
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:07,380
oh this now I've found my home now I find kind of with this I have a

238
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:13,140
sense of belonging in this universe because with this I belong

239
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:18,240
in that freedom because the freedom is letting go of all

240
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:25,020
the non-belonging all the ideas that I shouldn't be here all the ideas that you know other

241
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:31,260
people's ideas I shouldn't be here or something we let go in that freedom just this

242
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:40,140
just this and then for people who are Buddhist that movement of Freedom each moment is

243
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:46,559
represented by the idea of going for Refuge and the Buddha talked about how you

244
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,659
don't find your refuge in temples you don't find refuge in

245
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:57,720
he even talked about that can exchange in India in sacred grove sacred spots

246
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,120
you find the Refuge in this practice you find refuge in what you see how you see

247
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:09,360
being caught and how you see being free this is how you you find your freedom

248
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,480
and if you see that then he says you can see a path

249
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,720
and the and the path that you need to clear is he says is the Eightfold Path

250
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:29,700
so there so but the Eightfold Path is not something outside of you it's really something inside of you

251
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,740
and what it means is that like the part of it part of it is the the ethics the

252
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:40,740
three three of the Eightfold Path is ethical and you start seeing the invitation here

253
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:46,380
or is to not cause harm that's what ethics is about

254
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:52,740
not harm anyone and is is there an invitation does that feel is there a rightness something inside that calls on

255
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:59,460
that if you're still in quiet enough and can really be mindful and pay attention I

256
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:05,640
think with I mean all of us there is an imitation a call a request don't call

257
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,960
don't cause harm because when we intentionally cause harm

258
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,580
we're covering over our depths recovering over the capital

259
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:23,220
with more more debris more weeds and all that we're actually closing something

260
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:29,400
down when we're hateful or hostile or something and that doesn't feel good if

261
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:36,000
you really pay attention you're going to feel how we're diminished by that so ethics comes naturally through this

262
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,820
practice because that's what the deepest invitation is

263
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:49,500
and so each of the steps of the Eightfold Path some of you know what they are um is really an expression of something

264
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:55,020
that's already in US it's not an imposition from the outside

265
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:02,100
and so the value of stopping being still

266
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:08,539
and maybe if you're lost something will find you

267
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:15,480
and what will and what we find you is maybe the invitation that traces the

268
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:22,520
tracks the call here here is where to bring your attention

269
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:29,419
here is where to attend to to feel to be with to

270
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:37,020
this is where to walk this is what to do and and then we kind of follow the

271
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:42,120
traces and the tracks and

272
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:47,220
Something Beautiful begins happening Something Free and that kind of place

273
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:52,740
now I've been found even if it's not a geographical place

274
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:58,320
Maybe it's never a geographical place in Buddhism it's always here and now in

275
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:05,159
yourself and then you bring that with you wherever you go so even when you're lost physically

276
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,640
you're not really lost to yourself isn't that nice

277
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:17,640
so I hope that made sense for those of you who occasionally get lost

278
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:24,140
and if you don't get lost great for the potluck anyway

279
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:31,620
so thank you very much and we have a few minutes before we usually stop here and

280
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:38,399
so anybody have any questions they want to ask or testimonials about being lost that

281
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,580
relate to what I talked about or anything

282
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:50,299
oh then I have a poem to read but maybe I'll take some questions first and end with a poem

283
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,720
so

284
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,120
and if you say your name first that would be nice

285
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:32,279
hi I'm Caitlin um I was thinking of

286
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:38,220
being lost in sense of trying to find purpose which

287
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:48,179
I think many of us find on on our journey through life and I was watching a YouTube video and

288
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:53,580
on such thing and a lot of it was about how

289
00:30:53,580 --> 00:31:03,840
when you are constantly putting your attention to the outside world which is how modern society puts us on like puts

290
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:09,299
us towards you actually lose sight of what's within what your values are and

291
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:14,880
what's important to you and so part of finding your purpose is looking within

292
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,299
which is very much in line with right you were wonderful thank you and uh and

293
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:28,080
then part of that the importance of that is that there's all kinds of messages from culture from society or from family

294
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:34,440
about what the real purpose of life should be about and some of those don't serve us they're not they're not a match

295
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:41,039
for who we are but if we're if if we have to think we have to be that way but it's but it's there's a dissonance

296
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:46,760
between who you are and that thing then it can be a lot of tension

297
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:56,159
I have to be rich or I have to have a career or have to

298
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,820
you know it's all kinds of shoulds that we struggle under and what happens if we can listen deeply

299
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,919
within and become free of those social messages about what the purpose should

300
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,260
be about and find out what is it what is it that that makes our hearts sing what

301
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:19,799
makes our hearts feels happy and delighted you wake up in the morning happy to do

302
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:25,200
what you want to do and the answer for some people and this is kind of one of the things that I

303
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:32,340
think spirituality often points to is that one of the messages from our society is the answer to what is the

304
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:38,279
purpose of my life what should I do is a thing a what

305
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:43,919
you know the career or a relationship or something and what spirituality often

306
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:50,220
points to rather than a what a how how we're going to be in the world and

307
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:55,500
some people find tremendous meaning in how they live more than what they

308
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,140
live for what they do and and but that's a hard thing to justify

309
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:07,380
in by many segments of modern society because you know when people ask what do

310
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,799
you do oh I try to be kind

311
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:22,159
you know that doesn't so you know it's not what they're hoping for and

312
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:27,260
thank you

313
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:42,000
hi I'm Margaret you spoke a little bit about starting

314
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,159
over or starting from scratch when you're in the monastery can you say a little bit more about

315
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,860
how you did that or what that means to start over or be reborn

316
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:59,279
well it's possible that it was pretty fortunate I did it in that situation

317
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,500
because I'd been there already a year and and it was really you know deep in the

318
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:11,099
wilderness so we didn't get newspapers we got were like several days old and there was no

319
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:16,980
internet then there was no TV there so so you know so much of things had fallen

320
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:22,679
away that normally I'd be caught up with caught up in so that just made it really relatively

321
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:30,179
easy I think in compared to doing it in the middle middle of a busy life and it made a big difference that I was

322
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:35,658
meditating a lot so that the meditation was also a very deep

323
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:42,898
embodied and heartfelt kind of letting go and I could I I'd be doing it for some

324
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:49,320
time then by that time I'd been meditating probably for about five years by that time so I had some skill

325
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:55,138
and letting go but uh my mind from earlier in life had

326
00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:00,480
a lot of skills in picking up again after the meditation so you know

327
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,660
this I think was constant kind of this pattern of letting go and then picking up and back into

328
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,180
but uh but because I had to learn to let go in meditation I had a reference point

329
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:18,240
for what it was like to really just stop and that reference but even having that reference point helped me then find my

330
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,760
way and gave me some confidence in not needing to know not needing to have

331
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,339
every all these plans and ahead um so that that's I don't think my

332
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:36,260
answer is very adequate for you but that's the best I could do right now it's a good question

333
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,760
I was uh Imagining the path that you were talking about and I believe you

334
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,820
said something about maybe being on the path is more important than getting to the overgrown

335
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:02,520
capital and then you mentioned the Eightfold Path and that did Havoc with

336
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:08,940
my imagination and I saw the path splitting into eight different ways and

337
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:16,140
so I wonder if you could say more about how the Eightfold Path could help in our

338
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:21,240
path towards finding ourselves so kind of it's giving you a clue the April path

339
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:28,320
of what you're looking for in the jungle and we're looking for the the uh the

340
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:35,579
first one is the Right View we're looking at for the perspective in which we look at our lives and uh so what perspective is useful and

341
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:41,880
you may ask what perspective am I using is this a useful one and what what's the deeper requests

342
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:47,339
what's what perspective really is being you know the deeper request of the heart or something

343
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:54,240
and then uh the second of the Eightfold Path is uh kind of uh the right attitude

344
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:00,300
or the right intention or something and uh so you asked what is what's the attitude by which I'm going about my

345
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:07,619
life and the and the what we're looking for is more specifically is an attitude of

346
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:14,339
of uh non-harming and non-cruelty sometimes people say and non-greed or

347
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:21,599
non-lust and some people say um an attitude of being able to let go when

348
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:28,920
it's appropriate and attitude of kindness and attitude of compassion so what's the attitude so we're kind of

349
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:36,000
okay that's what that's what that's the footsteps of the little boy who's lost let's let's can we find that the

350
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,980
attitude and then uh how we speak uh how we act in the world it turns out

351
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:50,160
that you're not going to find your freedom uh through killing stealing and sexual misconduct

352
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:57,720
so you know that's a pretty big footstep to notice and then what's called right it's

353
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,780
usually called right livelihood I think that's maybe two two modern of a concept I think it's

354
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:09,240
more broadly a whole way in which we live the lifestyle that we live

355
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:15,540
that includes work but it's broader than just work and then so what's the lifestyle of

356
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:21,300
living is this lifestyle you know in Harmony and and uh is this you know

357
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:27,960
what's the deeper request and what's the what do I listen to what do I how do I pay attention to Lifestyle and then some

358
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:35,400
people realize I never thought about it you know I'm just going along with what I was given and but we start questioning

359
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:42,300
what is the lifestyle I want to live and then um there's the the the sixth of

360
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:50,160
the Eightfold Path is the uh the what we Endeavor to do and here uh the the hint that Buddha

361
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,440
gives with which step is not the what we do but how we do it and that is the how

362
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,560
is is it healthy or not healthy or wholesome or unwholesome so there is a

363
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:08,040
differentiation we see between what is healthy and not healthy for ourselves and that's the how

364
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:15,300
and then uh then there's right mindfulness yeah you know so one of the traces is um

365
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:23,400
do I have any mindfulness and you know and what and if if I asked if I ask the question how you know what

366
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,440
is awareness asking of me what does awareness want from me rather than being

367
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:36,119
the one who's mindful what happens because it's so important and then um a subtle Focus concentrated mind

368
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:43,500
that's another footstep I I now have this view of

369
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:49,680
the eight paths are in parallel and going in the same direction great

370
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:58,140
so I'm going to read the poem that I have for long and this is a somewhat famous poem in English poem by David

371
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:03,380
Wagoner and it's called Lost

372
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,359
so lost stand still

373
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:16,820
the trees ahead and the bushes beside you are not lost

374
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,380
wherever you are is called here

375
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:31,380
and you must treat it as a powerful stranger must ask permission to know it and be

376
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,960
known the forest breathes listen

377
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,540
it answers I have made this place around you if you

378
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:48,540
leave it you may come back again saying here

379
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:54,960
no tweet no two trees are the same to Raven no two branches are the same to

380
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,359
Ren if what a tree or a bush does is lost on you

381
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:07,920
you are surely lost stand still the forest knows where you are

382
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,319
you must let it find you

383
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:22,740
so thank you and maybe because we're having a potluck partly it would be nice if you can take

384
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,960

385
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:34,079
couple of people next to you and and if you're and welcome whoever

386
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,960

387
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:47,520
