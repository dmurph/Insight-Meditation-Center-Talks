1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,440
so here we are it's

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,560
Friday for some of us it's the morning for some it's later in the day might be

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,439
some for whom it's earlier as well I haven't seen people from the Pacific area but there might be

4
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:31,240
some off to the west of California

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:40,079
so let's uh let's sit together as we

6
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:49,680
do taking a posture that uh that supports being both awake and at

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,360
ease and taking a little time to scan the body breathing

8
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:10,720
into areas of Habitual tension or areas you feel tension now

9
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,920
even if they aren't habitual just breathing out and allowing

10
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,400
them to soften

11
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,520
and you might take a few uh deeper breaths really letting the in breath

12
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:43,280
expand the chest and the belly and then on the out breath just

13
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,560
letting go softening everywhere in the body that isn't needed

14
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,600
to keep you upright in a way that supports staying present staying

15
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:04,479
connected staying awake to what's arising within

16
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:13,000
your within you and in your experience meeting what's outside you as

17
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:25,280
well all the things that make up your life right now

18
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,879
it it can be useful to let this balance of uh wakefulness and ease be a kind of

19
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:48,800
Touchstone in the practice you know in our bodies and inner Minds that

20
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,239
balance just occasionally checking in not you know not

21
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,360
getting really obsessed about it tied to it but just occasionally checking in and

22
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,560
seeing is there a balance is there ease and alertness are they both there are

23
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,680
they balanced in a way that I can stay present to what's

24
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,280
arising right now and trust you know trust that you

25
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,959
have the discernment to see if if the balance is right in this moment if you

26
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:29,879
you know if it might be beneficial to ease up a bit or maybe to bring a a a

27
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:37,680
little more energy into the mind and body trust that you know what's

28
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:46,360
needed this kind of balance is something that uh that we need to attend to you

29
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:54,439
know no matter how long we've been practicing it's not just advice for

30
00:03:54,439 --> 00:04:02,360
people new to practice we can always take advant AG of

31
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,680
it e

32
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:12,360
and as we sit this morning I invite you to practice in the way that is most uh most useful to you

33
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,880
or maybe keeping the breath at the center or some other sensation some

34
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,600
other aspect of uh of what's arising or opening to

35
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,240
everything that's uh that's coming up inside you

36
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,039
and then your contact with the environment temperatures and

37
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,000
sounds whatever feels most useful this

38
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,639
morning and as we sit no matter what we're attending to we can be responsive to what's going

39
00:05:52,639 --> 00:06:00,199
on in the body in the mind we can we can check occasionally in an easeful way

40
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:08,038
not straining to see something but just noticing you know am I awake is there

41
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:15,599
awareness is there tension that needs to be eased in doing that if it can be done

42
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:21,280
with little effort and just noticing bringing more interest more

43
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,720
curiosity into um each moment that feels

44
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:37,039
uh like it could use it it's the idea of balance you know

45
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,280
staying staying alert staying awake to what's going on and at the same time

46
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,720
being in a in a as much ease as

47
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,120
possible as we sit and making the adjustments like

48
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:04,919
riding a bicycle noticing if we're leaning too far one way or the other it's it becomes

49
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:12,879
intuitive just making a little adjustment coming back to place of balance a place

50
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,919
of um being

51
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,680
awake being

52
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
awake

53
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

54
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440

e

58
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

59
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

60
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240

68
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

69
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

70
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

71
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

72
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

73
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840

e

78
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

79
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

80
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

81
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

82
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

83
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

84
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

85
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

86
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

87
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

88
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

89
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

90
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

91
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

92
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
e e

93
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,200
so as we as we near the end of the the sitting period just uh checking again

94
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:34,440
again to see is that balance of ease and wakefulness of relaxation and alertness

95
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:41,640
is it still there in the body in the

96
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:49,039
mind invite it even at this late period

97
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:55,440
in the sit and just let that balance accompany you as much as you can into

98
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:04,600
what comes next into listening to the darat into the day as it unfolds and

99
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:11,289
into your interactions with others with the [Music]

100
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,158
world I notice the effect of

101
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:31,279
that world needs balance among many things it needs

102
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:19,599
[Music]

103
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,940
[Music]

104
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,960
e

105
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:08,880
I just uh put the put the link in the uh in the chat again and I realized I I had

106
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:16,279
uh I rang the bell with the you know the zoom noise suppression still on so the

107
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:27,120
Bell didn't uh come through and then I rang it again so if you did hear it twice you know more power to you

108
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:38,440
so today is our our last day of the week

109
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,919
Friday and

110
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:49,399
uh and I realized this week I've offered kind of a lot of content um two lists

111
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:55,120
you know interacting that uh you know I feel they're really useful to to look at

112
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,880
together and I just I hope it hasn't been too much if it has I I apologize

113
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:07,679
but there's more today of course I've been uh talking about these six

114
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,960
qualities of the Dharma uh that are mentioned in a whole raft of suas and

115
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:21,039
that I've always found really inspiring it's a it's a list that I I like to look at again and again to uh and I feel like

116
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:27,960
it has become part of my practice just uh seeing the Dharma in these ways

117
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:35,039
so to to recap um the Dharma is said to be well proclaimed visible here and now

118
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:44,360
immediately effective inviting inspection aaso onward leading and to be realized

119
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:50,919
by the wise that's uh that's the sixth and final quality that I'll be talking

120
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:57,799
about today to be experienced or to be realized by the wise

121
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,000
Tabo vui hope I pronounce that

122
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:10,039
correctly so in the uh analogy that I uh I spoke up before that I once heard Gil

123
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:16,399
use about having a pebble in one's shoe as a example of

124
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,960
Dua uh the realization is obvious you know because the pain in the foot was

125
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,960
really obvious the cause was obvious and the remedy of course was pretty

126
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,559
clear but um it's not so clear or simple in many areas of life where where Dua

127
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:40,880
shows up

128
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,200
um often we don't recognize that there's pain in the situations and sometimes we

129
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,279
don't see the pain uh for years um it it

130
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:57,840
it sneaks up on us and when we start to practice the Dharma we see there are

131
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,320
perhaps attitudes in the mind just very subtle varieties of greed or aversion

132
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:12,638
that that have been causing uh you know a lack of ease a lack of uh peace um

133
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:19,440
lack of freedom in us and having an effect on others as well so things like

134
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:27,919
you know maybe anger or resentment anxiety craving for some kind of of sense contact you know craving for

135
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:35,320
a flavor or a substance or some kind of experience those can occur you know both

136
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:41,118
at very very uh intense levels and also very

137
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:48,358
subtly and uh and when there's an attitude in the mind like uh anger

138
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:54,919
resentment craving we may not see it we may not see it for a long time because we're looking

139
00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:01,200
through it we're not looking at it we often use that that analogy of a fish

140
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,440
that can't see the water it's it's swimming in you know any attitude in our

141
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:13,200
minds uh it colors what we see we can go on and on in life

142
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,240
believing that we just need to get a handle on on some on our anger just

143
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:26,240
learn to be more patient and and uh if we can refrain um you know that it

144
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:34,119
appears to be very beneficial and skillful but uh and it is beneficial and

145
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:40,680
skillful but at some point if we're practicing diligently

146
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:46,880
we'll see that we need to look squarely at whatever is arising in our minds that

147
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:53,000
is uh obstructive some kind of hindrance some kind of defilement you

148
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,839
know and to become really familiar and really intimate with them not indulging

149
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:06,040
and not repressing we often use those you know in the middle we want to be in

150
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:12,640
between not indulging not repressing Dua is to be understood you know that's the

151
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:20,280
instruction for the first Noble Truth to understand aruka and if we get very familiar with

152
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:27,640
the obstructive mind States we might begin to get a sense um that uh that

153
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:33,040
those ways of relating to the world because mind states are you know they

154
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:40,000
affect how we relate to the world they become the the way that you know the flavor of our interactions with the

155
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,240
world that they arose as defenses against some some pain that we've been

156
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:51,599
unwilling to feel and then we can investigate more deeply into the pain we

157
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,720
keep looking we keep being curious and luckily in the in the Dharma

158
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:06,160
we have many uh tools to work with to become aware of of Dua and to release

159
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:12,680
it we don't just depend on one strategy another strategy of taking off our shoe

160
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,920
and removing a pble we might offer ourselves kindness

161
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,640
warmth we might just be able to see the conditioned nature of uh anger and

162
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:32,400
impatience for example and and that can be enough Enough To Let It Go just seeing this is not me this is not me

163
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,560
this is just something I learned maybe we see how attached we've been to a particular way of responding

164
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:50,119
you know that we've identified with being particular kind of person you know I'm a um I'm a judgmental person I'm a

165
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:57,560
um I'm a really optimistic person I'm a really impatient person I'm a some kind

166
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:04,599
kind of identification and when we see and recognize that well we see that you know

167
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:11,400
just because we've learned to behave and to act act out of a certain kind of

168
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,839
mental orientation it doesn't mean that's who we are it's just something we

169
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:24,480
we've learned gradually any reactivity in US begins to weaken awareness reveals that

170
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,920
what we thought of as our our character our personal ity the character traits

171
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,760
you know character traits they are just simply habits habits that we learned and

172
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,880
they they can be unlearned they can be

173
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:50,040
abandoned the last thing that uh Sheridan bless in in his essay on

174
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,280
performative literacy is a uh a capacity

175
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,319
uh to Monitor and direct one's own own reading process you know

176
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:08,079
metacognitive awareness so that's a that's a kind of a

177
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,920
um an interesting term metacognitive awareness so that's a it's a big big

178
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:22,240
term in uh in the education World um but it applies uh all across um the world of

179
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,920
thinking which is the world of humans I guess it's an awareness of how are minds

180
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,960
work how we tend to approach situations in life awareness of you know it

181
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,800
includes awareness of what we find easy what is more difficult for us mentally

182
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:45,480
kinds of skills that come easily to us the kind that that we don't that don't come easily to

183
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:51,720
us so to have that kind of awareness of how our mind works you know learning how

184
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:59,480
our mind works in the most subtle ways that's really at the heart of how we become free in our Buddhist practice we

185
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:05,560
see we see where we grasp and where we push away at base you know because those

186
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:12,000
are the sort of you know the base uh movements of mind um that get us in

187
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,359
trouble grasping and pushing away where there is H good discernment

188
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:24,200
we begin to see where there is good discernment and where we're driven by old habits where there's peace and where

189
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,280
there's stress and uh and gradually we incline our minds more and more in the

190
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:38,240
direction that doesn't have Dua in it to become skilled in practice each

191
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,400
each of us needs to be able to discern what where effort might be needed how

192
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,359
much effort that we we need to to apply in a particular situation and what are

193
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:58,359
this particular skills or qualities uh from the Dharma that would support our growth

194
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:08,240
so I mentioned um impatience U mentioned it a couple days ago it's one it's a it's one of my uh um

195
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,640
you know companions sometimes on the paath we we might notice that we're more

196
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:19,240
impatient or we're more easily annoyed than we'd like to be and and we can

197
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:24,480
apply antidotes to that you know we can take a pause we can cultivate more

198
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:31,640
patience we can practice loving kindness we can practice gratitude always useful

199
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:38,240
and we use different strategies at different times depending on what the external situation is and what's our

200
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,520
mental state our mood and attitude what do those seem to ask for in the

201
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:50,640
particular situation we find ourselves in the Dharma when when we come to learn

202
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,599
how our minds work we we just be we become able to use them in a more

203
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:04,960
skillful way way and by skillful I mean cusa you know wholesome what tends in the direction

204
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:12,599
of of uh the end of Dua rather than more Dua so sometimes you know just being

205
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:21,480
with what's going on in our minds and hearts with mindful attention is you know the wisest choice to uh to as an OP

206
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,800
as a a way of operating and sometimes we need to apply some kind of anid some we

207
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:34,119
need to take some kind of action and we as as our practice goes on we develop an

208
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:40,440
inner compass that uh that can keep us headed in the onward leading direction

209
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:48,880
away from what's unskillful what will ultimately lead uh uh away from from

210
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:54,839
dooka Dua for us or for others towards peace towards uh towards

211
00:42:54,839 --> 00:43:00,558
care care for ourselves care for others care for the

212
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,640
world so it's useful from time to time to kind of evaluate our practice to see

213
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:14,599
you know are we just skating along Have We Become complacent um are we feeling like oh I'm

214
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:20,760
mindful enough my meditations are calm and pleasant so that's all that needed

215
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:27,280
or maybe we're straining you know maybe we're developing a tight mind feeling like we're not getting anywhere and we

216
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:34,280
really need to work hard at it and as a result not feeling any ease or

217
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:40,640
peace and if we have discernment as a result of coming to know our minds

218
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:46,800
coming to know the Dharma um we can uh

219
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,800
recognize that it might be more useful to practice in a different way to be more relaxed to be more

220
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:00,119
receptive we learn about how we respond to different situations and what's uh

221
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:06,520
you know what's the most for us individually what's the best way to

222
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:12,640
respond to each situation that we that we come across in our lives we each walk

223
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:19,119
our in own individual path no two paths are the same and as I

224
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:25,559
said before and is often said you know only we can walk our our own path the

225
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:30,480
Buddha can't walk it for us no one can walk it for

226
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:36,520
us so we come to know our minds we come to know all our strengths in all our

227
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:41,720
quirks and I think it makes a lot of sense to compare walking the path of

228
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:49,240
practice to its end to its uh its uh complete blossoming let's say to the

229
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:55,040
reading of difficult texts each one of us is a complex of so

230
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:02,200
many variables so many threads of conditioning going going back all the way to our birth you know or further you

231
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:09,359
know if if we're um if we CAU into the idea of rebirth we're all one of a-kind

232
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:18,720
Creations you know the Dharma is to be realized by the wise that's us only we can realize the

233
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:25,359
Dharma and realization becoming wise becoming the wise one who can realize it

234
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:32,599
is a result of walking the path we don't and we don't actually need

235
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:38,200
to understand the conditions that have given rise to who we are right now in

236
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:44,280
order to become free but by reading ourselves carefully being open to new

237
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:50,440
interpretations being willing to change our minds to try new behaviors you know

238
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:56,680
new ways of looking at our experience he hi Paso come and see for yourself we can

239
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,920
come to see beneath the major conditioning forces of our individual

240
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,599
lives we can become begin to see the commonalities that characterize all

241
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:14,280
Human Experience the in the Buddhist view you know anicha Dua

242
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:22,640
anata Inc constancy stress suffering not self treating the path as a long

243
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:28,480
exploration of what it is that makes up our inner lives it it takes us from the

244
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,839
purely Personnel into the realm of what we call wisdom in the in the Buddhist

245
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:40,599
tradition we don't become free by taking on beliefs about what life is all about

246
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:46,720
about who we are in the deepest sense we discover these things they reveal

247
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:53,240
themselves to us they become visible here and

248
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,838
now they reveal themselves to be immediately affective

249
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:05,280
itive when we approach our experience with focused attention with C curiosity

250
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,200
with willingness to start over again and again to be in the place of not knowing

251
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:17,800
to be in the place of of uncertainty of unwillingness to of willingness to

252
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:24,839
question our views to change our minds to be open accepting and of course to be

253
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:32,800
kind to come and see again and again that's that's our

254
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:39,960
practice All Along The Path as we practice and learn we see these qualities showing up these six

255
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:47,599
qualities well proclaimed visible here and now immediately effective inviting

256
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,680
inspection onward leading and to be realized by the

257
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:59,200
wise and as we continue I believe will all come I hope we will to the

258
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,880
conclusion that the Dharma is good in the beginning good in the middle and

259
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:13,119
good at the end I'd like to close um today's uh
