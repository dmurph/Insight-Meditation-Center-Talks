1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:08,460
um so last week I had a co-teacher with me on the monitor Kirsten she'll be back

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,639
next week and I think we'll redo the she'll stay for the first half and then

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,640
when we do breakout groups and stuff she'll sign off because she couldn't hear but um

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,920
last week we talked about wise understanding and wise intention

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,640
and how those two things those two factors help us with our practice so

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,059
just just to give you a little heads up about what the com you know topic was and in the handouts it has it kind of

7
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:45,780
says more than even I talked about so for those of you who weren't here

8
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,079
this is week two and so tonight the topics are concentration mindfulness

9
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,239
and the five hindrances so this is a lot and I will not be

10
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:04,699
talking in detail about these things I'm sort of going to try and just introduce these Concepts to you

11
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:10,280
I'll be doing more classes throughout the year and we'll go into more depth

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,360
like to many of the things that I'm introducing you to in this series

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,259
this series is sort of this jam-packed Jubilee of all the most important

14
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:26,820
components of a practice in my view so it's a nice kind of introduction but

15
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,700
don't feel like you're learning everything or that you need to learn everything right

16
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,060
um next week we'll be talking about actions that support joy in our practice and the

17
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:46,079
week after is about sustaining practice with wise effort so that's just the map

18
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,040
of what we'll cover um and

19
00:01:52,140 --> 00:02:01,020
before we'll do it just a short sit just literally a very short little settling sit but before we do that I would like

20
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,799
to respond to you all and your your interests so it would be helpful for me

21
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:14,280
to know you know of these three topics for tonight mindfulness on and off the

22
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,319
cushion concentration and the five hindrances

23
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:26,459
I'd love to know if you could choose you know your your top two

24
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,760
um maybe that would be or you know I'd like to know your rank order preference in detail but of course

25
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,000
I can't get that so um who here is like most interested in

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,260
mindfulness on and off the cushion okay who who here is most interested in

27
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:52,140
concentration okay and who here is most interested in

28
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,800
the five hindrances okay well we'll just have to do a tour of all of them and

29
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,360
just know that we're we'll touch lightly on them and and then another question for our all of

30
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,480
you is I'm what's more important to you

31
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,440
a small group discussion where you get to talk to your fellow Sangha members

32
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,560
the question tonight will be about these three things and where you would like to

33
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,200
focus what you might like to try based on what you would you'd heard and the chance to hear other people so that

34
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,540
would be the small group Breakout and the guided meditation would be a

35
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,659
practice that's designed specifically for working with hindrances so

36
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:49,260
um who is more interested in the breakout group time who's more interested in the guided

37
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,780
meditation okay

38
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,120
got breakout group yeah breakout group more interested great

39
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,640
okay guided meditation on hindrances a little bit more okay so I'll try and

40
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:12,659
I'll just we'll still do breakout groups I'll just try and um maybe make them a little bit shorter

41
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:21,720
so we have a little bit more time with a guided meditation great okay let's settle let's find our bodies

42
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,020
we're just like a three minute little practice here

43
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,699
just finding some deeper breaths maybe helping the Mind Orient to

44
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,100
being in the body in this present moment

45
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,460
in this room with these people

46
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,580
you know right here work is done hopefully at least it is

47
00:04:53,580 --> 00:05:00,080
now just helping yourself take that in

48
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,240
that you you chose to be here and you get to just be here

49
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,020
with your whole body so with that in mind

50
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,600
breathing a few deeper breaths inviting yourself

51
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:26,880
to give yourself permission to just be for two more minutes just to

52
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,400
be here until everything's subtle and catch up and kind of be in the same

53
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,100
place the same time

54
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,580
foreign

55
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:23,220
[Music]

56
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:29,280
and just take a moment to notice what changed what's different from just that

57
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:36,120
three minutes of sitting just to acknowledge for yourself if anything's settled maybe something

58
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,400
became more pronounced just acknowledging

59
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,639
the impact of the practice for yourself

60
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:58,080
okay so

61
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,560
and somebody willing to be a microphone delivery person me too great

62
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,560
so you go ahead and get that microphone if you don't mind and I want to start

63
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,960
um actually by talking about the five hindrances and

64
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,120
um the first the way I want to cultivate see how much you guys are aware of these

65
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,220
things already is what what happens that gets in the way of your practice what do

66
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:33,539
you notice that impacts your ability to practice mindfulness and to sit on a cushion

67
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,820
you know you might think about that because there's all of life but if we're

68
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,979
maybe start by thinking about when I sit try and sit down and meditate

69
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:50,820
what happens that makes it hard all right anybody have an answer

70
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,820
meats are great agitation agitation can you describe that at all

71
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:04,019
a lot of spinning a lot of spinning in the mind okay anybody else anything besides

72
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,899
agitation great Caroline

73
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:20,459
to say it's simple like emotions kind of agitation but not just just a

74
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:26,959
strong emotions okay great what else

75
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:37,380
great Ben what's next you start thinking what's

76
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,779
next you start planning kind of yeah okay great

77
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:49,620
what else makes it hard to sit down and meditate so we've heard agitation in the

78
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:55,200
minds we've heard strong emotions we've heard a mind that's thinking what next

79
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:02,360
what do I need to do next great

80
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,800
um I think distraction boredom boredom okay boredom and like seeking

81
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,000
distraction that happens okay and like bodily discomfort great

82
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,720
you wanna

83
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:28,700
there's so much to do so that I can be enough

84
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:35,040
okay so much to do so you is it like your mind gets involved in planning or

85
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,940
thinking um yeah there's this constant sense that um I need to be doing all these things

86
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:49,399
okay okay great anybody else anything else yes back here

87
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:03,180
um I feel like there's a bit of resistance resistance yeah okay great Tracy anything for you that you notice

88
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:09,300
so I start noticing tightnesses in my neck and my shoulders

89
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,940
and my body starts talking to me when I choose to listen

90
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:22,220
um anybody fall asleep get sleepy oh yeah

91
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,220
yeah okay all right so I'll list I'll name the five hindrances for you and you listen

92
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,620
for you know try and pick one of them or two of them that feel like they fit with

93
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:43,279
what you described okay and we'll see if it works but so they're typically listed as

94
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,560
desire like wanting right um

95
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,959
lust you know the whole the whole stream of wanting

96
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:01,800
um craving kind of thing aversion not liking not wanting

97
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,140
I don't like this get this away from me make this stop

98
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:15,839
um restlessness and worry so um that's there's two components left

99
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:23,339
bodily agitation can't settle and the mental right and um

100
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:28,920
sloth and torpor which is in the body tiredness you know

101
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:35,820
can't stay awake can't stay attentive in the mind drifty hazy

102
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:41,160
sleepy and the fifth is doubt

103
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,920
am I doing it right should I do this is should I do a different practice should I be doing it like this should I be

104
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:53,040
doing it like that or or why am I even doing this what's the

105
00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:00,600
point kind of you know it could be a big doubt about the practice could be a doubt about my capacity

106
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:08,940
I'm I can't do this my mind won't let me do this I have ADHD there's no way I can do this you know like or you know I'm

107
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:16,820
just a no good whatever so but all of those are connected that I just to doubt

108
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,540
so do you the things that come up for you fit within those categories

109
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,399
yeah the mind that gets busy planning Ben is probably a Restless mind right

110
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:35,880
and maybe there's two things the desire the greed the wanting right that also

111
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,940
can fuel I need to do this I need to do that right

112
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,639
um so it can be that you have more than one hindrance happening at one time

113
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:54,540
so you're all normal you have normal Minds normal problems

114
00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:02,279
you the same problems have been experienced by meditators since the Buddha taught and probably long before

115
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:07,620
so these are energies that happen in the

116
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,920
mind and they are really helpful things to learn how to work with and to recognize

117
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,560
right to start to say okay oh this is the hindrance of restlessness and worry

118
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:26,279
oh you know sort of like you you know if you're doing cognitive behavioral therapy this is my cognitive distortion

119
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:33,600
of the day right um it's also helpful because if we know we

120
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,600
have tendencies we can try and do things to balance for

121
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,820
example if we know we tend to be restless and worried and and unable to

122
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,399
sit we might think about walking or doing yoga before we meditate

123
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,880
we might think about a transition between being busy busy busy and when I

124
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,160
when we sit we might also think about the time of day we're sitting so some people it's

125
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,100
much easier to sit in the morning before they've fully launched in their day

126
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:15,360
so it's good to start to know a little bit about when the what hindrances show

127
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,660
up for you more than others and just to start recognizing them and as I mentioned I'll do a guided meditation

128
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,180
later but um it's nice to just sort of start

129
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:33,420
letting these things kind of um you know be curious about them and how

130
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:43,019
they they show up for you so greed desire lust aversion hatred not liking those

131
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:49,860
are two different ones right Polar Opposites one thing to look at in your body is if

132
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:56,519
there's leaning forward or leaning back it's a very visceral thing that starts

133
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:03,019
to happen with aversion and desire so for example

134
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,660
I'll just na I'll just say a few words just just close your eyes and tune in

135
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:15,800
and notice your body ice cream

136
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,440
dogs

137
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,680
driving fast

138
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:35,180
going to a party with lots and lots of people

139
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,940
being alone

140
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:53,899
milk water

141
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:00,079
The Color Purple

142
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,759
the color orange

143
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,160
a rainy day

144
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,699
a warm sunny day

145
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:21,438
a really hot day

146
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,400
okay what did you notice in your body

147
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,160
could you feel a sense of shifting when you heard something you

148
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:42,200
like how did you feel that in your bodies what did you notice where's the mic again

149
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,539
anybody willing to say a word or two great

150
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:06,480
well when you said ice cream I was I immediately leaned into it but then you

151
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,440
said so I there were a couple of like an extremely hot day like the heat wave from last week and I was just like oh no

152
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,220
so yeah definitely it's just instant so yeah it's like just your body knows

153
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:26,700
right your body knows so we can also recognize if we're liking or not liking

154
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,580
by tuning into our body sometimes our body can tell us before we can know mentally

155
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:38,100
thank you anybody you want to say anything different they notice it in a different

156
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:46,140
way it can manifest differently I can sense a hot day or a big party my body tenses

157
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:54,480
up tenses up and the rain and being by myself I felt like relaxes so great in

158
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,960
my body I felt it's great Corey

159
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,600
uh I felt changes in temperature like slight warmth or slight cold which was

160
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,059
interesting that's great great because yes right you we all know right we can

161
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:18,780
get hot or how you know when we think about certain things this is great anything else anyone wants to share

162
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:25,919
Ben actually I felt all of them were nice ah

163
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:33,299
you liked it all I liked it all I mean in this right context okay that's great

164
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:38,960
who else liked them all anybody else no

165
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,400
well Ben you're a Liker that's nice yeah

166
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:51,480
all right so maybe turn the mic off for a second thank you Mitra so much for your help

167
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,120
um okay so that's like our brief tour of the five entrances right and um like I

168
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,760
said we'll come back to that um later when we do the guided meditation

169
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:09,480
um so now let's let's talk about um let's talk about mindfulness

170
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:17,039
um I think I'll just start by uh sharing a

171
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:23,760
couple of quotes So first of all there really isn't anything you can do and there isn't anywhere you

172
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,400
can go that mindfulness won't support you it's it's it's applicable everywhere

173
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:37,200
and when the Buddha teaches mindfulness he talks about being mindful walking forward walking backwards you know

174
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:44,460
standing up sitting down laying down every posture you can imagine eating

175
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:50,280
going to the bathroom mindfulness everywhere all the time

176
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,760
so it's something that we can practice all the time

177
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:02,880
here's a quote by Anne Cushman if I view everyday chores as tasks to

178
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:10,080
rush through on the way to something more important they become a crushing waste of time

179
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,419
so I'll reread that again if I view everyday chores as tasks to rush through

180
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:22,639
on the way to something more important they become a crushing waste of time

181
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,200
but from the perspective of Buddhist teaching each of these activities is a

182
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:36,600
golden moment an opportunity for full Awakening there are Awakening poems of monks and

183
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:45,559
nuns who woke up doing one patachara was pouring water

184
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:51,539
it was just something like that somebody else that was turning a light on and off

185
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:57,120
so Awakening doesn't have to happen you know with your eyes closed sitting still

186
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,840
it can happen in the midst of your everything

187
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:12,360
another um quote I'll share is by Sayo dawu chataka

188
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:20,340
when the mind is not mindful it feels like a homeless person very insecure very unhappy

189
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:27,179
when you are mindful you feel really at home so mindfulness is my home

190
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:34,140
when you are mindful you are at home when you are not mindful you are on the road to nowhere

191
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:42,679
get in touch with the spiritual Part of Yourself the beautiful part of yourself be mindful he says

192
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:49,140
so when the mind is not mindful it feels like a homeless person very insecure

193
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:57,260
very unhappy when you're mindful you feel really at home so mindfulness is my home

194
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:06,419
I like that this one got a chuckle too when you're not mindful you're on the road to going nowhere right

195
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:14,159
so there's that automatic pilot that happens in our brains when we aren't mindful where we just start to eat and

196
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,220
do go we're driving we're not really paying attention we're putting things down we're forgetting them we're leaving

197
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:28,919
our keys our credit cards were you know yeah doing things that we're not

198
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:37,559
mindful of right we just sort of get busy doing consuming often too

199
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:46,399
clicking and the internet getting lost in that so

200
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:53,159
so mindfulness is uh it's actually kind of a I like one of the ways Gil talks about it is a

201
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:58,980
collection it's like a number of different qualities that we're cultivating

202
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:06,120
and and it's like together when they're all mutually working they provide you

203
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:12,480
know um what I like to think of as the raft the raft that helps us stay afloat and

204
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:20,340
not lost right so uh one of the classic definitions is mindfulness is paying

205
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:25,820
attention on purpose

206
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,620
in the present moment so we can't be mindful in the past or in

207
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:37,100
the future we can only be pres mindful Here and Now

208
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:43,740
and it's um we can be mindful that we're thinking but it's pretty hard to stay

209
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:49,200
mindful of thinking without getting lost in thought but it is possible

210
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,659
to be aware that we're thinking as we're thinking so that's the thing as we're

211
00:24:54,659 --> 00:25:02,340
doing it mindful of breathing as we're breathing aware on purpose intentionally that okay

212
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:08,159
I'm breathing in and I know I'm breathing out and I'm feeling it

213
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,500
it's a it's a an experience it's not conceptual

214
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:20,820
so mindfulness is this awareness and connection to what's happening in the present moment

215
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:27,960
the other part of it is with you know um our attitude matters

216
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:35,039
so we want to cultivate a an attitude that is

217
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:44,658
often the word is kind that can be also allowing or open

218
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:51,480
so if we're doing this pay attention pay attention

219
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,940
pay attention is that kindness is that you know is

220
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,460
that has its that would be a hindrance that we're adding to the mindfulness

221
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:08,640
right an aversion you know critic critical mind

222
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:16,380
so that that is another piece that we need to start to learn to tune into is okay I know I'm aware but how am I being

223
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,260
aware what's my relationship to what's going on

224
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:27,960
you we're good okay so

225
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,059
practicing mindfulness helps us grow wisdom

226
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:38,960
we actually get grow the kind of wisdom the Buddha talks about it's a wisdom of

227
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,580
learning to discern and see what's happening with clarity

228
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:51,360
so it's not a a book wisdom it's an applied wisdom

229
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:58,200
it's the wisdom that starts to learn we learn and it grows inside of us and it's

230
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,720
there to help us and it's akin to the wisdom in our body

231
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,900
that knows a hot stove is hot take my hand away

232
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:17,360
it's that kind of wisdom that helps guide us through life

233
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:25,860
um it helps us meet our experiences without reactivity

234
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:33,000
we can choose to respond versus react so it helps us kind of slow things down

235
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:41,220
take pauses gives a little bit of space between ourselves and what's coming up and what

236
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,919
we're meeting and this ability to meet our experience

237
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:53,580
without being reactive to it actually allows mindfulness to go deeper

238
00:27:53,580 --> 00:28:00,419
and deeper deeper and deeper into seeing more and more deeply the true nature of what's

239
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,840
Happening

240
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:17,100
this is where I think I'll just sort of bridge and then we can Circle back to concentration

241
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:23,159
so cult building our mindfulness moment to moment mindfulness will help us with

242
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:28,340
concentration practice it will help us

243
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:36,960
develop a mind that is more calm more centered more intimate with our experience

244
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:43,799
concentration that word I think is a difficult word

245
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:50,520
for many of us because when you think about concentrating I have to concentrate

246
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:57,720
there's a contraction that we often think about like I have to I have to work really hard yeah

247
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,880
but if we engage with mindfulness or meditation in that kind of way what

248
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:09,020
happens anybody have an experience

249
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:17,179
if you try really hard Ben oh

250
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:31,380
that's describing concentration I'll ask you to say it again for the the yeah I mean once uh up here up here sorry once

251
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:37,260
you're present yeah and you calm

252
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:45,000
and you see something in its totality it's just like just like breathing is a

253
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,179
flow yeah so as we establish mindfulness

254
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:56,580
right then the concentration begins to come and that is I I how one of the ways

255
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:05,760
I like to describe concentration is relaxed it is connected it is with

256
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:14,159
this feeling of flow and um there's different kinds of concentration

257
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,559
there's concentration that is a moment by moment kind of practice

258
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:26,760
and then there's a concentration that has to do with what they often will say is absorption

259
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,580
absorption like um

260
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:42,960
everything with concentration there's a quality of wholeness so we're not trying

261
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:49,679
to get rid of anything it's like instead it's like say we're we're focused on the breath

262
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:57,120
it's it's more like oh the breath just gets closer and closer it just like and

263
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,520
it gets it's almost like in the mind it it it starts to fill up the mind because

264
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:09,360
the the mind is so interested in the breath that it's like you know what we pay

265
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,840
attention to gets bigger right does that make sense we we pay attention to it's like a magnifying

266
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,120
glass for our experience but with this it's very relaxed way of

267
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,820
concentration that it's just this natural way that the

268
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:32,820
mind just becomes deeply intimate and connected with the experience of breathing for example

269
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:40,440
so you might your mind just gets maybe filled with the experience of breathing and as you're feeling it in your body

270
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,260
so there's not a lot of excessive thinking and other things going on in this kind of

271
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:51,899
in this kind of concentration practice yeah Mitra go ahead just use the mic

272
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:58,559
please so are we mostly talking about concentration on the cushion not I mean

273
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,860
our mindfulness on the question yeah that would be what this last part would be more on the

274
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:11,520
cushion yes it can happen you can have momentary concentration

275
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,559
like that sometimes when you're on a retreat and it can happen when you're

276
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,140
out doing things but it's it's uh you're going to have really been slowed down already

277
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:29,820
but you can also have another kind of like of just a very Crystal Clear Connection awareness with the

278
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,860
concentration that's like tracking very carefully you can see things as they're

279
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:42,179
coming up they can see what the activity in the mind you know you can see the impulse to do something before you do it

280
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:48,240
you know it's like you can kind of see things that you normally wouldn't be noticing

281
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,700
and that would be more like you could do that in the garden you could watch that

282
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,700
you know in their kitchen doing the dishes you could see that

283
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,659
any other questions about

284
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:10,340
concentration or mindfulness

285
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,840
can you speak into the microphone because there's people that can't can't hear you

286
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,539
I think if you try to force yourself to concentrate then it becomes more tiring yes

287
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:33,539
and you get tired faster absolutely so for if we put too much effort that was

288
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:39,840
sort of where I was asking a long time ago what happens if you try too hard like the the

289
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:46,679
concentration that we think of when we're trying if we bring that into meditation we do we get exhausted in the

290
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:52,320
way that I think about it is I get kind of brittle you know I just it's like

291
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,080
it's just too rigid it's too tense and um

292
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:05,640
you know the body gets uncomfortable and the mind starts to fall apart

293
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:13,618
yeah go ahead I guess on the topic of being tired of

294
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:19,560
being wary I feel like I've noticed that as I'm more mindful it actually tires me

295
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:25,260
out not because I'm trying but it feels like seeing the patterns of repetition can

296
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:32,940
kind of wear me out yeah so that can be the you know but the thing to notice is it is being aware of

297
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:39,500
it what makes you tired or is it your reaction to what you're seeing that makes you tired

298
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:45,980
does that make sense so if I have a version to what I'm noticing

299
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:54,060
it makes it more exhausting to notice if I am judging myself because I think I

300
00:34:54,060 --> 00:35:00,180
shouldn't be doing what I'm doing it's going to make it harder

301
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:07,800
so part of it is to be curious um and notice how am I feeling about what

302
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:13,700
I'm observing and see if there's any hindrance in there

303
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,820
and then if it's if there's no hindrances you just feel like your mind's getting tired maybe you could

304
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:27,420
just sometimes once we start to establish mindfulness and we've got a good flow we actually don't have to work

305
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,940
as even as hard as we were we might need to just sort of okay what

306
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:39,720
if I try 10 less 20 percent less sometimes we need to do 20 more 30

307
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:45,420
percent more right but adjusting the effort that we're applying might be

308
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:52,560
indicated is that anything else about what you said I feel like maybe an addition part

309
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,900
of it is as you kind of are mindful of emotions and it kind of open up to it more

310
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,940
maybe there's also like a bit of fatigue from kind of just letting it flow more

311
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:09,380
yeah absolutely yeah absolutely yeah great point

312
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:16,619
um so maybe I'll shift to just talking about a few things that are kind of helpful for growing mindfulness because

313
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:24,660
mindfulness will support you know the concentration too right so one is being mindful of our body

314
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:30,060
our bodies right are always everything we experience

315
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:36,960
through the body is something that's happening right here so using our senses and staying

316
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:44,160
connected to what's happening in our body is a great Gateway back to the present moment and and so

317
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,400
building our awareness of our body as we move around having a practice of every time you get

318
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,859
up and walk somewhere to noticing your feet or maybe your chest

319
00:36:55,859 --> 00:37:02,339
and your breathing and you start to build a pattern of standing a walking of sitting with

320
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:08,160
mindfulness it that that helps you it helps you it

321
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,420
just helps you stay with the more continuity of the mindfulness

322
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:20,940
and um if you ever are struggling to try and get

323
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:27,540
out of a lot of heavy thinking it is you know look through use your senses

324
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:33,359
site sound touch smell taste

325
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:41,940
these are like great doorways into the present moment and so orienting toward

326
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:47,099
touching what it feels like coolness you know warmth

327
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:52,260
um you know if you're doing the dishes starting to notice the smell of the dish

328
00:37:52,260 --> 00:38:00,500
soap you know the fill of the warm water helping yourself come more fully into the present moment through the senses

329
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:10,680
so another thing is to start to notice Choice by being mindful you start to

330
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:16,380
grow your capacity to make choices so it can be kind of fun to start to

331
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:22,200
sort of say okay if I'm mindful here what might my choices be

332
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,900
just kind of drop in the question if I could choose this fine but if I was

333
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:34,260
wasn't going to choose this what would I choose what else could I choose

334
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:40,079
putting my right shoe and first or my left shoe on first you know just simple

335
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:46,859
things or standing up sitting down going for a walk not going for a walk just just opening the mind up a little bit

336
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:53,480
and and emphasizing how mindfulness support choice

337
00:38:54,359 --> 00:39:00,660
um another helpful way to start to build this non-reactivity is to look for our

338
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:07,339
opportunities in your life where you have some mild discomfort

339
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:14,339
any kind but mild so it could be that you know just

340
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:19,920
sitting in your postures right now you know if you start to feel a little bit

341
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,320
uncomfortable just hang out with it just just a moment longer than you normally

342
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,440
would before you move or you know do something

343
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,800
just just practice lingering a little longer with discomfort an itch

344
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,540
you know adjusting

345
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:50,579
and notice what happens if you can bring like that mindful attitude of allowing

346
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:56,220
or accepting instead of the aversion of not liking not wanting

347
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:02,280
right just being a little bit curious now I'm not asking you to hurt yourselves okay at all

348
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:08,160
this is just like playing with your edges growing your edges being with

349
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,560
something that's a little bit unpleasant a little bit longer and learning about

350
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:20,220
about that for yourself we grow a very quick habitual response

351
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:25,619
to unpleasant experiences just and you know we've just through our

352
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:31,380
lives we just have grown to like do things to make ourselves feel better

353
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:38,160
all the time but some of it is unneeded unnecessary and it's fueling a

354
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,460
kind of a habitual pattern of just moving away right

355
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:51,660
another way to grow mindfulness in your daily life is to choose an activity that you do every day

356
00:40:51,660 --> 00:41:00,540
like I'm brushing your teeth making your bed making your coffee and make it a habit to do that activity

357
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:06,540
very mindfully really going you know taking it in with all of your senses

358
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:12,720
and and then you can grow your your habits you know you start with one work

359
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,960
on it for a while when you feel like it's pretty natural then maybe you look for a second one that you add

360
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,500
and you just kind of keep growing and building it's also nice to practice mindfulness

361
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:32,940
in nature you know the sounds outside can be very

362
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:39,660
helpful for staying present and it can be interesting to um Kirsten

363
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:45,900
was here she would talk about this because she's a big nature person and one of the things she said is she

364
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:53,099
really likes to notice her impact on in nature itself too so how are the

365
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:59,339
squirrels responding to your presence what are the ants doing in response to

366
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:04,740
you like really kind of tuning in to how you're coming into an environment and

367
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:11,339
impacting the creatures and the life and that environment so that's another way to tune in to the

368
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:17,760
present moment um another thing that can be fun to

369
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,579
support kind of building our practice is having a meditation buddy

370
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:29,940
and it might just be that you have somebody who you text and you say hey I'm sitting now want to join me

371
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:36,839
or maybe you just say sitting now and they just know or maybe you have somebody who likes to sit with you

372
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:43,320
so there's just a whole variety of ways to to share and support each other's practice

373
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:49,440
yeah okay so let's

374
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,540
um let's let's have a little small Breakout

375
00:42:54,540 --> 00:43:01,380
discussion maybe um you know three or four people together so you can just kind of cluster

376
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:06,780
yourselves and um I just want you to talk about

377
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:11,780
um well why don't you go ahead and move first and I'll give you your instructions

378
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,819
do you want to join a group Sage okay great

379
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:38,240
so yeah maybe just say your names um

380
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,660
see okay

381
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:51,359
and then the the thing to talk about is you know we just covered a lot of

382
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:58,560
grounds concentration practice mindfulness growing mindfulness and daily life and

383
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:05,700
the five hindrances so just take a minute to check in and and just say the question for you right

384
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:12,599
now just to notice for yourself is what which one of these what did I hear that I feel like I

385
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:20,160
really would like to work on I'd like to take a suggestion or I'd like to learn more about this

386
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,619
um where do you feel and some inspiration some energy

387
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:30,660
and you know what are you most inspired to do

388
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:35,760
and then with that what would be the easiest thing to do

389
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:42,359
to support you in that direction so if you could just um

390
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:48,060
take like one or two minutes each I'll probably give you about five minutes

391
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:56,040
so it's maybe keeping it about one minute one and a half minutes to share what your answer is and Rose

392
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:02,520
yes sure desire

393
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:08,819
aversion restlessness and worry sloth and torpor so those are two

394
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:17,819
couples right and doubt yeah and I'll happy to say it again yeah

395
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:24,720
all right so go ahead and um maybe the person with the shortest hair could start and then you can just go clockwise

396
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,440
from there

397
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:49,700
blurry area

398
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:04,400
something that was appealing to me was the idea

399
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:21,920
basically like physical activities [Music]

400
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:37,800
foreign so it's been about a minute so a little

401
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,339
over a minute

402
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,160
building images

403
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:27,440
[Music]

404
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:34,319
is

405
00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:40,460
right now

406
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:55,560
just a minute timer just yeah you can go over not just giving you a little bit of

407
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:00,619
a um

408
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:10,640
foreign

409
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,640
hmm

410
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,929
[Music]

411
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,619
you can keep talking among yourself you know

412
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,000
you know

413
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:39,619
but they feel like really

414
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:47,359
so just taking your time to finish up your sentences go ahead

415
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,599
it's like

416
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:02,180
maybe think thank your buddies

417
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:15,119
all right thank you guys it's fun to watch you I

418
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:21,000
can't really hear you but it's fun to watch you so um

419
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,960
I think what we'll do is go right into the guided meditation and then we'll have a chance to debrief both the group

420
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:33,180
and the um the guided meditation before we end

421
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:40,579
okay so I'm going to share a practice

422
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:48,960
it's an acronym like usual we have acronyms for things to help us remember this acronym is Bella

423
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,040
as in beautiful

424
00:50:54,300 --> 00:51:00,119
so the first thing that we want to do is

425
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:05,760
in your meditation just in your practice right now being mindful eyes open or

426
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,500
closed whatever works

427
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:18,960
we'll practice with a hindrance so just noticing if there's a hindrance

428
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:25,099
present already it's a greed or desire

429
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:32,460
aversion hatred restlessness in the body worry and the

430
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:38,160
mind sloth I think it's sloth like in a sloth

431
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:45,119
Sloth animal very body slothful and torpor and the mind is just

432
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:52,400
no energy doubt

433
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:01,440
so just being with and if it's not present now maybe thinking about one

434
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:08,838
that comes up for you that's not going to overwhelm you to pay attention to

435
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:16,859
so when a hindrance comes up the most useful thing we can do first is to let

436
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:24,119
it be to learn open up around it and notice how it manifests

437
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:28,099
doesn't mean giving in to it

438
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:38,099
doesn't mean letting it dictate what you do but it means not acting or reacting to

439
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:44,160
it there's training and being present for

440
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:52,020
this experience without being in conflict with it giving the hindrance some room some

441
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,380
space

442
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:35,000
the E and Bella is examine

443
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:42,260
so Freedom requires us to have wisdom

444
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:51,079
being able to work with the hindrance requires us to understand the hindrance

445
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:59,220
so getting to know it examining it to understand it

446
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:04,980
to recognize the way it manifests its components

447
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:13,020
the physical component of the hindrance how it feels in the body

448
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:17,900
the energetic component

449
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,000
the emotional

450
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:34,380
and the cognitive the way it affects how we perceive how we think what we

451
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,619
think

452
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:51,619
it also has a motivational aspects to it motivating us to do something

453
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:04,740
getting to know physically

454
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:10,920
energetically emotionally

455
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:18,480
cognitively motivational

456
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:20,220
when you're ready when you feel like you've gotten to know it as much as you can in the moment

457
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:26,160
the next part of Bella is the L to lessen

458
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:34,400
to lessen the impact of the hindrance and really that is happens by relaxing

459
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:41,280
relaxing the mind and the body sort of starts to soften the intensity

460
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,760
of it

461
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:58,260
maybe directing your awareness toward the breathing if that is a soothing relaxing

462
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:01,460
experience for you

463
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:09,859
if not that is there some part of your body that feels really neutral

464
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:16,760
and can you just pay careful attention to that neutral part of your body

465
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:22,400
[Applause]

466
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,880
the second L is still let go

467
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:52,980
you know when when it's not serving us when we can't really benefit from being with it anymore

468
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:58,460
it can be time to say okay enough for now

469
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:05,760
and how do we let go maybe we need to recognize that there is

470
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:15,078
a belief that's unhelpful that's fueling it so can we shift our belief our view

471
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,540
maybe we have a strong sense of I am this

472
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:30,660
and maybe we need to practice with non-identification it's just a feeling

473
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:35,000
it's just a thought it's not who I am

474
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:47,220
maybe it's already softened so much with the relaxing that

475
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:52,700
that's all we need to do it's already letting go it's happening

476
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:05,339
maybe we recognize that there's a habit we have in our daily life that fuels

477
00:59:05,339 --> 00:59:12,900
this hindrance way that we're unconscious and doing

478
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:19,740
something over and over again that fuels this Con this this hindrance and we

479
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:28,220
see that so we feel you know maybe I can try to do this instead of that

480
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:40,020
and if it's really strong you might need to get up and go for walking meditation

481
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:43,400
or do loving kindness

482
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:51,420
the A and Bella the last part of the practice

483
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:59,280
is appreciate so just in the course of this short practice

484
00:59:59,819 --> 01:00:06,599
was there wisdom that grew in sight that came a lessening a change in your

485
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:14,160
relationship with the hindrance was there anything in here that you can appreciate small

486
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,119
is fine

487
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:25,980
appreciating whatever is skillful and supportive

488
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:33,839
is very helpful might even just be I really appreciate

489
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:39,900
that I'm trying really appreciate that I sat here with

490
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:47,119
this as best I could and that is enough to appreciate

491
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:20,480
I'm gonna allow five minutes of silence for practice in whatever way feels supportive to you

492
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:29,520
you can continue with the Bella practice or you might choose an anchor

493
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:35,760
for your awareness like breathing or sound sensation

494
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:41,540
and just see if you can rest a little bit with being

495
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,980
not having to do

496
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:52,099
being with

497
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:30,780
I'll offer one other thing which is if you are finding it difficult to settle

498
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:38,160
the mind because we've just been looking at a hindrance a concentration practice

499
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:42,920
could be to count your breaths

500
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:49,740
so as you breathe in knowing you're breathing in you one

501
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:56,960
and then you exhale breathing into

502
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:05,819
and exhale up to up to 10. and then at ten you let go and you start

503
01:03:05,819 --> 01:03:12,720
at one again and if you get lost just start at one again

504
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:18,420
very easy no problem so that's a concentration practice a

505
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:23,760
practice that can help settle the mind if you want to use that now please feel

foreign

508
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:42,258
and again just checking in noticing the Mind noticing the body

509
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:47,718
just noticing if there's any desire

510
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,338
any aversion

511
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:03,080
any sloth or torp her any restlessness or worry

512
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:06,679
or any doubt

513
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:16,640
and maybe just bow to yourself for seeing

514
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:21,500
seeing into your experience in this way

foreign [Music]

518
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:06,320
okay great all right so

519
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:13,860
what was that like for you that guided practice Corey right behind you Mitra

520
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:18,320
right right turn turn there you go

521
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:26,230
um well I noticed that during the examination portion

522
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:31,760
[Music] um I I was working with uh restlessness

523
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:38,100
and I noticed uh uh you know faster heartbeat or some

524
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:45,179
tension things in my mind were um you know I was I was thinking

525
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:51,420
bouncing around and during that examination I uh noticed

526
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:59,640
also something else there that there was energy there was playfulness there was nice excitement and

527
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:04,800
um so I took that as sort of like

528
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:12,540
it put a different perspective on on it that not to be pushing it away or one it was more like

529
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:21,300
being with it and then that allowed it to kind of dissolve a little bit beautiful beautiful Corey

530
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:24,079
thank you

531
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:40,140
I too I too was um during the examination portion I realized the thing

532
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:46,800
that I usually struggle with is restlessness and then I get and I'm very fussy and then I realized oh I think

533
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:51,960
it's because I'm very anxious like always anxious like as a person that's

534
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:59,040
who I am and I'm like Oh my uh all the questions like am I doing this right is this okay wait now I know I'm thinking

535
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:04,800
and so and then all those things started popping in but then I'm like but I'm like okay

536
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:10,140
um this is I tried to follow the Bella acronym but that last part

537
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:16,800
the a appreciation I'm like well I appreciate the fact that I'm Restless because it brought me to meditate

538
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:23,940
because I want nice so though it's like came full circle so yes

539
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,900
thank you

540
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:38,659
oh all um oh good Tracy go ahead yeah please

541
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:48,780
I could not stop thinking about a recipe that I read earlier

542
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:54,900
I think I must be very hungry um I just kept seeing it in my head over

543
01:12:54,900 --> 01:13:01,020
and over again and so I said okay there you are

544
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:08,580
let's bake this recipe so I imagined myself actually making its

545
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:14,760
turkey sweet potato chili it sounds wonderful but I you know I I couldn't

546
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:20,280
make it behave itself this uh-huh recipe that

547
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:26,580
kept wanting to play in my head so I said okay well let's just make this recipe and I you know watched myself

548
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:32,460
making it and that's almost a meditation in itself is

549
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:40,080
you know preparing the food I could almost smell it cooking

550
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:47,100
I so rather than trying to push it away I

551
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:53,280
I decided just to go with it and uh worked out pretty well for me I think

552
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:58,100
but now I want to go home and make the chili for sure

553
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:04,920
yeah so there's something um really important about one thing you

554
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:11,820
described as it sounds like there was a lot of like trying to make it go away in the beginning that created a lot of

555
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:18,659
tension and more stress yeah and so this kind of giving in to it

556
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:25,080
or giving it some space now a very delicate thing to do right because

557
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:32,699
we need to stay mindful of of thinking is happening and be aware that we're imagining and

558
01:14:32,699 --> 01:14:38,760
all of that but it sounds like it was helpful for the tension to recede but

559
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:45,840
also the desire is growing so just noticing that too right so that there's

560
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:53,699
there's in a way maybe it helped not grow aversion but maybe it also did

561
01:14:53,699 --> 01:15:01,040
spark a little more desire yeah does that feel right okay great

562
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:09,060
anybody else have any Reflections or observations to share this is so

563
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:13,100
wonderful to hear from you all

564
01:15:17,699 --> 01:15:26,400
does the Bella practice Phil it sounds like you you know found it useful it's actually not in your handout so

565
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:32,460
um do you want me to send it to you in writing the Bella practice yeah

566
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:38,120
I can do that okay

567
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:44,780
yeah usually mostly I just teach it when I'm teaching the five hindrances

568
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:51,440
yeah yes be Let It Be oh yeah

569
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:56,540
b-e-l-l-a so B examine

570
01:15:56,540 --> 01:16:01,820
lesson let go and appreciate

571
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:09,000
yes Mitra um I was pretty calm and I was able to

572
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:15,780
follow that better for something imaginary yep but and then when you did

573
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:21,540
the concentration the counting the breath I started doing that and all of a sudden

574
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:29,219
something happens in my brain that it just starts a thought and it I can't stop it so I

575
01:16:29,219 --> 01:16:35,699
get to that point and I completely um disabled I I don't know what to do

576
01:16:35,699 --> 01:16:42,900
and I think I almost always get there that's called anxiety I don't know what

577
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:51,420
that's called okay and I just don't know I mean there's nothing that I can do to

578
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:57,960
did you that would be a great time to kind of um we'll see if Bella works so

579
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:05,820
you kind of just stop and be with what's happening so you know you're trying to count and

580
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:11,820
you're counting and then all of a sudden your mind starts thinking right and it's

581
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:17,100
you can't let go of the thought right so

582
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:22,380
um it sounds like you're not sure you know maybe just paying attention to your

583
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:29,159
body if you think about the thinking and how it felt was your body leaning forward leaning

584
01:17:29,159 --> 01:17:35,840
back you know so I just get very frustrated and very

585
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:42,719
um aggressive towards the thinking so that's a version a version aversive

586
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:48,659
towards the thinking itself that's right so then you would practice with noticing

587
01:17:48,659 --> 01:17:55,320
the aversion so instead of thanks staying focused on the thinking you go oh look at the

588
01:17:55,320 --> 01:18:02,100
aversion oh there's not liking the thinking there's a lot of anger frustration about

589
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:07,320
and so what does that feel like so then you so you be with that aversion

590
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:13,920
first so feeling that just oh this is a version it feels pretty awful I don't

591
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:21,000
know how long can I stay with that yeah so you be with it as long as it feels right examine it just sort of so again

592
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:27,179
you're like noticing this is aversion not not getting caught and being mad at your

593
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:32,640
thoughts for thinking but paying attention to that energetic

594
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:37,679
quality of the the hindrance so you know

595
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:45,540
you it went in with a version and some other feelings it's hard to stay with them very long right so one thing is

596
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:50,699
our awareness can get kind of tight and it can be helpful to kind of invite it

597
01:18:50,699 --> 01:18:55,980
to open up a little bit how um literally

598
01:18:55,980 --> 01:19:01,320
you might take your hands and if this is your head thinking right now just go

599
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:06,360
ahead and feel the exaggeration of it let your hands hold here yeah and then

600
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:11,940
literally imagine sitting back relaxing and opening up just right and you feel

601
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:18,900
it if I see it in you right there nice so literally just helping yourself physically in this way what we do with

602
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:23,840
our body our mind can follow sometimes

603
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:30,560
um so then the um letting go you know like the lessening

604
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:37,980
and you've already lessened when you've done this so I just oh look it's listening okay and the letting go is

605
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:43,140
like okay well maybe I need to let go of wanting to count or wanting my mind not

606
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:50,820
to think you know that's feeding the aversion so let me let go of that practice let me

607
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:56,580
let go of trying to make myself stop thinking and

608
01:19:56,580 --> 01:20:02,400
um thank you and then we even if you know everything

609
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:09,000
isn't the way we want it to be can we appreciate can we appreciate oh it shifted a bit oh

610
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,640
I got to see I got to see the hindrance and I got to practice with it in a

611
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:20,159
little different way and can I appreciate that does that make sense

612
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,699
okay

613
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:34,920
I'll read you a little quote and then we'll see if there's any more Reflections to share

614
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:40,199
um what we're doing here tonight is growing

615
01:20:40,199 --> 01:20:46,820
our wisdom yeah you feel a little wiser yeah

616
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:54,239
and so we when we grow that wisdom and we practice and we really turn toward our

617
01:20:54,239 --> 01:21:00,560
experience in this way we grow our faith

618
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:07,020
we're told the teaching we practice with the teaching we see how it works we need

619
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:12,540
to notice our own process so we can trust the teaching we have a

620
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:19,440
little more faith in the teaching because oh yeah I see this right

621
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:25,679
we might grow faith in the teaching the Dharma the Buddha the teacher or the

622
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:33,780
Sangha like what we're doing with each other here is supporting each other right doing this by yourself at home not

623
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:39,000
so easy but hearing other people share is hugely

624
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:46,440
supportive so these are the the gems that the Buddha really emphasized this Dharma the

625
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:54,239
teacher and the Sangha the Buddha the Dharma the Sangha and so we can grow our faith so noticing

626
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:59,460
I have a little more confidence I have a little more faith this might really help

627
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:06,840
there's something here this is a precious thing to take care of

628
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:15,239
it helps us when we have doubt or the other hindrances come up having a moment like you described Corey

629
01:22:15,239 --> 01:22:20,400
you and Rose you know Mitra even just in that moment

630
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:26,760
you know Tracy all of you everybody who shared you have this moment you can be like okay

631
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:34,140
oh yeah things can shift I know how to shift oh they did it I can probably do it the

632
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:39,840
Buddha did it okay right this is very important

633
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:45,679
in part a very important treasure for us to grow in ourselves

634
01:22:46,739 --> 01:22:52,739
it will support us in our efforts to keep sitting back down on the cushion

635
01:22:52,739 --> 01:22:59,420
keep coming back to the Sangha to keep listening to the Dharma

636
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:08,040
so I want I want to invite you to notice and and share if you're willing to share

637
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:15,440
a moment where you felt like you gained some Faith or confidence tonight

638
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:23,460
if you're willing to share as part of honoring that and and sharing it with others that would be really beautiful so

639
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:29,239
is anybody willing to talk and about that name something

640
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:44,820
um so my aversion was desired

641
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:49,820
and um

642
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:58,199
examining that I tried to imagine

643
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:03,360
what what would it be like if I have these things this thing that I think I

644
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:09,960
want and realizing that if I had that thing I

645
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:15,480
would still be sitting right here and meditating and so

646
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:21,480
it really didn't matter if I have or have not

647
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:29,219
um so um it sounds like that that was a pretty significant reflection yeah yeah

648
01:24:29,219 --> 01:24:36,000
it's very very helpful wow that's great that's great so something

649
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:42,719
to remember right beautiful thank you Caroline anybody else grow a little bit of Faith

650
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:46,940
or confidence tonight that you're willing to share

651
01:24:55,699 --> 01:25:01,560
so I was actually I had a new resistance today which I normally don't have which

652
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:07,920
is aversion which because I uh when we started the whole Bella practice what I

653
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:14,940
kind of found myself thinking about some just like some uncomfortable experiences

654
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:22,980
and what I wanted was not to think about it but as I explored more of it like actually I

655
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:31,380
realized more truths about you know what that experience is and also kind of

656
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:36,840
I don't know if this will last or not but this I had like a new uh almost like

657
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:45,540
uh shift in my mind because I realized that the discomfort that comes from feeling a

658
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:52,980
sense of loss is I mean it's um the the shift essentially for me at

659
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:59,580
least in the end which was with the appreciate was that uh oh okay I actually found myself

660
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:07,679
appreciating the fact that I even had an experience that is worth losing like

661
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:14,639
even that is a grateful um I mean even that's something to be grateful for so I think I don't know if

662
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:22,020
I'll like be able to keep that maybe that's something that you know is worth practicing as well but that's not how I

663
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:27,659
think on a daily basis like normally I'm just like obsessed with my loss rather

664
01:26:27,659 --> 01:26:33,659
than um and with the the appreciating you had the experience

665
01:26:33,659 --> 01:26:39,239
yeah beautiful beautiful thank you wow

666
01:26:39,239 --> 01:26:45,620

669
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:05,300

670
