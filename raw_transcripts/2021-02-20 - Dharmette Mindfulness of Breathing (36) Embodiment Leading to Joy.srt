1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,120
so

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,200
i think many of you have heard from me

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,000
and maybe

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,440
other buddhist teachers and teachings

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,199
the value of being embodied

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,600
so much so that i sometimes will

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,359
with kind of imagine that it would be

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,519
nice if we had translated

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,640
sati not as mindfulness but as

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,840
body fullness it's such an important

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,920
part of this practice

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,280
and in the two classic buddha

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,160
teachings by the buddha on mindfulness

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,520
practice

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,079
in the discourse the four foundations of

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,960
mindfulness and the discourse on

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,480
mindfulness of breathing it begins with

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,680
an emphasis

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,680
on mindfulness of the body and

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,960
now one of the reasons for this

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,840
is that the body the more present we are

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,360
for our body

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,119
the more we're aware the more there's

24
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,520
awareness that's alive and

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,280
and kind of available through the body

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,560
the more the body becomes an instrument

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,600
for the growth of meditation practice it

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,280
becomes the vehicle

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,640
in space for some of the deeper feelings

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,159
some of the deeper

31
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,280
qualities of meditation that begin to

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,400
arise it's kind of like as the body

33
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,439
receives some of the benefits of

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,880
meditation

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,360
those benefits are augmented or or

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,840
not augmented but those those benefits

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,119
grow and

38
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,000
fill out and we get the most out of them

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,799
so

40
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,720
what i'm talking about here partly is

41
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,920
that as the body becomes more alive and

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,759
more sensitive and more of

43
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,439
an instrument of sensations and

44
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,520
experiences and feelings

45
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,479
it's not just feeling the body itself

46
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,360
but it's also start the body becomes the

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,200
the sensor for feeling

48
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,720
some of the goodness that comes from

49
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,560
meditation and i would use the word

50
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,040
goodness

51
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,319
in a very abstract vague way like

52
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,640
just like maybe like the word all the

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,319
some of the positive feelings that can

54
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,560
come with meditation

55
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,879
so um classically it's joy and happiness

56
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,360
but it could also be contentment i like

57
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,720
the word ease

58
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,160
quite a bit um there can be

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,519
uh gladness there's

60
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,280
deep feelings of equanimity deep

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,120
feelings of

62
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,560
of confidence that can arise

63
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,480
even feelings of being of inner

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,879
cleanliness and inner

65
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,400
purity that really are embodied feelings

66
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,720
that

67
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,200
kind of course through us so all these

68
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,400
qualities

69
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,879
are felt more fully when they're felt

70
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,080
throughout the whole body

71
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,720
felt with the body if the body is not

72
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,000
available

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,959
then it becomes a mental thing and

74
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,400
sometimes that's quite

75
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,440
wonderful and profound in its own way

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,840
but it's really especially in the

77
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,760
beginning stages of meditation

78
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,599
it's really a way of being quite limited

79
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,599
in the experience and it gives us a

80
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,280
different impression of what meditation

81
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,879
is about

82
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,440
and different orientation which if it's

83
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,000
too

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,200
much towards the mind it doesn't really

85
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,239
help us

86
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,440
develop the wholeness

87
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,879
the unification of all of ourselves

88
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,280
which

89
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,159
is ideally what we're looking for in

90
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,799
buddhist meditation

91
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,239
i think it's one of the meanings of

92
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,319
samadhi is unification

93
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,920
bringing it all together here present

94
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,120
so the so again the body is not just a

95
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,720
you know a a bunch of physical stuff

96
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,640
that we have to carry around with us

97
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,879
the body is a is a significant

98
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,720
uh repository of nerve endings

99
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,319
significant uh location for

100
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,199
uh the emotions the feelings the the

101
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,120
goodness of meditation to course through

102
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,479
us or to fill us

103
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,440
and be here um

104
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,040
the um the

105
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,919
so to begin tuning in being relaxing the

106
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:32,400
body

107
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,960
sitting in with the body feeling the

108
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,080
body

109
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,840
is uh one way in which we begin to

110
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,919
um open up to this repository of

111
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,360
goodness as i said classically what

112
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,320
comes next

113
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,080
after the first four steps of

114
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,400
anapanasati what comes next as a

115
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,759
practice deepens

116
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,120
is some feelings of well-being joy or

117
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,560
ease or

118
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,759
gladness and something like and so

119
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,680
uh to know that that's coming to know

120
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,759
that's part of meditation

121
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,840
um it can then encourage us to be a

122
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
little bit more sensitive to when they

123
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,479
start

124
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,440
appearing hints of them appear and we

125
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,400
start feeling

126
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,039
a little bit these good feelings that

127
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:17,840
come

128
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,520
sometimes it feels like pleasure in the

129
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,919
body or tingling at places

130
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,840
a sense of lightness that comes and

131
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,080
it's not that we're trying to make it

132
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,919
happen so much or

133
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,360
or searching for it or striving for it

134
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,520
but when it begins to show show

135
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,880
themselves a little bit

136
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,080
there's an art to opening to them

137
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,199
to relaxing with them to include them so

138
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,199
they go along with the breathing or the

139
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,160
breathing goes along with them

140
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,199
so we encourage us to become even more

141
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,400
embodied

142
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,520
to feel these in our body and as we feel

143
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,639
this goodness

144
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,720
to kind of breathe with it and open with

145
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,080
it and continue this

146
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,000
process of feeling and sensing and

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,759
developing

148
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,080
as we go along and

149
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,800
so the contentment is part of this

150
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,160
to feel contentment allows

151
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,080
it isn't like again a moral obligation

152
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,600
to feel content

153
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,400
but it allows for this filling out of

154
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,240
the practice and really

155
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,560
being rooted and centered here in this

156
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,039
body feeling more and more

157
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,840
the same thing with this idea of being

158
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,520
in the present moment and not thinking

159
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,280
about the past and future

160
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
it's not like a moral obligation we have

161
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,720
to do that

162
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,680
but when we're no longer caught up in

163
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
the past and future in thoughts

164
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,919
it allows for possibility of filling out

165
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,000
more into the wholeness of this

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,880
moment that includes so much more of us

167
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,199
and it's kind of like a

168
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,199
momentum a movement towards becoming

169
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,360
really whole and present

170
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,039
with all of who we are and part of that

171
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,479
comes along with relaxation and and

172
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,599
tranquility calmness is a more and more

173
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,360
space for

174
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,639
delight and joy well-being a

175
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,599
sense of pleasure and just being alive

176
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,080
and being

177
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,120
here and i think of this joy of

178
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,560
meditation

179
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,960
as being a joy that has no opposite

180
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,440
it's just a joy that exists kind of in

181
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,120
its own way

182
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,360
if it had an opposite then you know it's

183
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,240
we can swing

184
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,960
from one to the other but it has no

185
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,000
opposite so

186
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,919
certainly we can not have it not be

187
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,919
there but it isn't that it swings it's

188
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,520
not part of a pendulum that goes from

189
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,199
one to the other

190
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,960
so for example if your joy is dependent

191
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,440
on

192
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,800
praise the opposite then is blame

193
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,960
and then the pendulum can swing because

194
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,240
it's dependent on

195
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,960
getting something or if your joy is

196
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,840
dependent on

197
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,759
success then there can be failure

198
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,160
if it's dependent on physical pleasure

199
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,360
it can be dependent on

200
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,479
things being uncomfortable and so

201
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,440
but the joy of meditation does not have

202
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,639
an opposite

203
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,759
it just has this wonderful simple

204
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,879
and clear quality of surfacing and

205
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,120
arising and being here

206
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,319
without really in a sense not depending

207
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,759
on the things that come and go in the

208
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,039
world so much

209
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,080
but is a wellspring that flows within

210
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,120
the body and so the more we can kind of

211
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,680
center ourselves in the body relax and

212
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,880
be present

213
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,839
the more

214
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,440
we will be

215
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,839
you know starting to open up to our

216
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,839
potential our capacity

217
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,839
for well-being for joy for happiness

218
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,200
and and that's a wonderful thing and

219
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,519
it turns out that meditative joy and

220
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,800
happiness

221
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,920
is a wonderful it continues this process

222
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,160
of unification of wholeness bringing

223
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,760
more and more of ourselves into the

224
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
picture

225
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,760
so that we can

226
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,480
continue on a path to liberation
