5

on e

6
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,479
once again a little rusty and all the buttons that have to be pushed and

7
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:26,240
U so again uh welcome everyone to

8
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,240
our YouTube community and I'm delighted to be back to be sitting with all of

9
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,200
you and uh and something

10
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:47,200
very certainly kind of personal and and heartwarming to come down to IMC

11
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,680
here uh in the morning getting ready at home and coming down here and sitting

12
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,840
down here in my meditation posture to be with you to share the Dharma and

13
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,240
and to um participate with you in the

14
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,879
Dharma so um one of the for me remarkable

15
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,280
aspects of mindfulness awareness practice

16
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:27,360
is the time or the the the transition from awareness

17
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,519
practices mindfulness being being maybe we can call it simply

18
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:40,360
mindfulness simply awareness to having a clear

19
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:47,640
sense that uh mindfulness and love

20
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:56,319
are just about synonymous maybe not exactly in in all their Dimensions but they

21
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:03,239
can't be te's apart or I don't know maybe they can be teased apart but in doing this practice

22
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,080
I came to a point where they arose together almost as if they are the same

23
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,879
almost as if they coexist like maybe like right and left hands coming

24
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:21,640
together to bow or maybe like

25
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,720
um um

26
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,439
just comes to mind is petting a cat and feeling affection for the cat

27
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:41,560
and the petting and the affection the contact the awareness of the cat the participation with a cat is the

28
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,519
same so to sit with

29
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,920
love to sit with love as a reference point and there are many flavors of

30
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:01,040
Buddhist love and uh the word can be very vague just using it by

31
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:09,439
itself and one of the flavors is friendliness a basic good will a basic

32
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:17,840
attitude of meeting our experience meeting others with friendship or

33
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,199
goodwi well-wishing and to be able to meet

34
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:30,560
anyone we meet anyone at all with a very basic

35
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,400
the basic love of stepping towards

36
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:44,520
them with Good Will with a friendship a

37
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,680
friendliness it doesn't have to be that we like someone it doesn't have to be that we agree with them it doesn't have

38
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,840
to be that we have what normally would call love as a high

39
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:05,160
bar but we can have that joy we could have

40
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:12,360
the the miracle

41
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:19,000
of opening our Good Will Opening Our Hearts

42
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,680
Opening Our Eyes to gaze upon others

43
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,720
kindly to gaze upon them as if

44
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:38,560
of course we would look upon others with kindness because to not do

45
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,120
that we have discovered is to diminish

46
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:51,000
ourselves to not do that means something closes something tightens something

47
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,639
resists something uh is becomes Limited in

48
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,919
US there's a way in which the Buddha

49
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,639
emphasized Good Will can have an unlimited quality

50
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,919
characteristics no limitation that we feel within ourselves

51
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:20,680
nothing closes nothing resists nothing shuts

52
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:31,919
down and it's almost as if love and awareness arise together as a

53
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,639
default because the alternative is not

54
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,919
healthy so let's sit here to whatever degree you would like

55
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:51,319
whatever degree that works for you to whatever degree that you're

56
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:57,240
inspired to meet yourself with Good Will to meet your difficult emotions with

57
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:05,160
Good Will to meet your um physical challenges with a level of

58
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,840
Good Will that's good for your heart that's good for the world's

59
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,639
heart so to assume a meditation

60
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,280
posture and

61
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,440
to begin with a posture assuming a posture

62
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:38,720
that is an expression of good will for

63
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:46,639
yourself the longer you meditate the more you know how

64
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,639
to enter into a posture of

65
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,560
meditation that feels good that feels right

66
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:07,400
that feels healthy and beneficial for you and if you don't haven't found

67
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:15,720
that just the wish to find it can be an expression of Good

68
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,840
Will without expectation without expecting to find it right

69
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:32,880
away and then with that good will to gently softly not too

70
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,479
much taking some deeper

71
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,519
breaths maybe with [Music] appreciation for the oxygen you'll

72
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:54,240
breathe in the carbon dioxide that you breathe

73
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,040
out in breathing you're being cared for

74
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:08,720
even if breathing is difficult it is an expression of your

75
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,680
body caring for

76
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,160
you relaxing on the exhale

77
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,920
relaxing the whole body

78
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,279
settling into your meditation

79
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:59,800
spot letting your breathing return to normal

80
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:22,360
and whatever way you're breathing whatever the sensations of breathing you

81
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,040
have breathing has an influence on the body

82
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,240
has an influence on the mind the

83
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,120
heart breathing has an influence just beyond the

84
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,680
edges of where we feel

85
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,920
breathing let that emphasis

86
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,680
let the influence of

87
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:12,040
breathing be like the softest gentlest

88
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:22,320
wind or the most comfortable feeling of warmth

89
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:41,720
that spreads kindness through your

90
00:11:52,040 --> 00:12:01,240
being that spreads the warmth tenderness softness

91
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:10,000
of Good Will through your being

92
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:41,040
and whatever your attention lands on whatever present moment

93
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,160
experience comes into

94
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,279
mindfulness Let It Be

95
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,040
received with kindness with good will

96
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,120
let this Soft Wind the soft

97
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,839
warmth of friendliness

98
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,600
welcome whatever there might

99
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120

friend so let your mindfulness meet whatever is happening

107
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,079
for you even what is

108

that allows you to be aware with a

123
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,519
kindness with a

124
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:55,039

and as we come to the end of this sitting

129
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:06,320
to open your awareness your

130
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,640
imagination to The Wider world around

131
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:29,159
you and to recall or think about the wider world of friends family Neighbors

132
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:39,640
strangers out across the world what it would be

133
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,840
like that whoever you

134
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:53,000
meet at least you meet them maybe

135
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,240
privately with a gaze of kindness

136
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,399
a gaze of wishing them well imagining

137
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:12,159
them well wishing them well in a healthy good

138
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:19,760
psychological emotional way that they would turn

139
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:30,080
around and be more friendly to the next person they meet that they would be kinder

140
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:39,640
warmer to offer our good good will to the whole

141
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,559
world so that others might be more

142
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,799
disposed to also have good

143
00:28:52,399 --> 00:29:00,039
will certainly not to meet people with some opposite of Good

144
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:05,240
Will that would predispose them to do the

145
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,600
same may all beings be

146
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,760
happy may all beings be

147
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,760
safe may all beings be

148
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,480
peaceful may all beings be

149
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:39,559
free and may the kind gaze we have upon others

150
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:47,880
the open heart we bring to others spread a world of good

151
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,320
will even in the midst of all the ill will there exists

152
00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:00,519
in the world may we spread the winds of

153
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:17,180
[Music]

154
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,200
kindness thank

155
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
you

156
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
e e

157
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,000
so hello everyone and welcome to this Monday

158
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,760
morning sitting and now this Dharma talk and I've been away for a couple of

159
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:51,279
weeks and happy to be back for this week and I will be away again next week

160
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:56,399
then I'll be after that I'll be back for a while and the reason again is to be to

161
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:06,039
teach a retreat IRC I just finished one yesterday and um and I realized well

162
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:13,840
after having scheduled next week's Retreat that the retreat is during the election national

163
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:20,720
election so uh we've given some thought to what it means to have this national

164
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:28,399
election during a retreat and how to um probably many people on the

165
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,919
retreat are anxious to know the results and will probably be trying to find out

166
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:39,399
what they are or and so how to inform them how to

167
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:45,039
support them to um process uh the election no matter

168
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:53,360
what direction it goes might be important for this Retreat we're doing and also it might be important for

169
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:01,120
many of you and it might be um you know I can imagine that there are many of you

170
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:08,720
and others who are anxious about what's happening concerned about what's happening and um

171
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,880
and no matter what the who wins who doesn't win what happens with the

172
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:22,399
election that it could be distressing for someone if not

173
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,279
everyone and so uh maybe if there's an occasion to

174
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:35,919
it's important enough to have a um I'll have a YouTube Zoom meeting uh for

175
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:43,360
people uh during the retreat I'll some figure out some way to set it up a time where I can do it and and in a sense

176
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,399
kind of leave the retreat to support those who maybe need some support in

177
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:56,559
this regard and um and but uh for this week that I'm back I thought that um it would

178
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:04,960
be important to um teach something that uh maybe would

179
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,000
support you over these next weeks and and it's not just the elections

180
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,919
which has people uh concerned uh and uh some people are are more than concerned

181
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:25,280
or um and um it's a you know it's quite

182
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:33,040
difficult for some people what's happening in the world World these days and uh

183
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,480
so I would like to somehow this week try to support you and address some of these

184
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:45,560
but to do so in a particular way that probably will not satisfy some of you

185
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:54,118
who are demanding action and and um and all that but um the

186
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:01,400
um uh I want to offer you one way to transform the world and that's kind

187
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:09,079
of maybe the title for this week's series to transform the world and

188
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:16,480
uh and to transform the world uh for the

189
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:22,599
better so um one of the important questions to

190
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:28,200
ask all of all of us to ask for ourselves and for each other is

191
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:35,839
how do we understand how change happens how do we understand a kind of a theory

192
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:42,720
of change or an approach to how change happens to yourself as an individual to

193
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,320
a family to a neighborhood to a friend Circle how does change happen in The

194
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,560
Wider world how does it happen politically how does it happen socially and

195
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,640
um and this I think this question needs a profound

196
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:05,680
consideration uh because uh we have I've see a lot of people with very strong

197
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:13,960
opinions about what should happen what has to happen and um uh but there's no

198
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,640
reference point for how that change Could Happen uh

199
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:27,640
except that someone out there needs to do it and uh and uh but how does change

200
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:35,960
happen is I'm not going to answer that question directly but what I will say it happens in 100,000 different ways it

201
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:44,680
happens in seven eight billion different ways and um and different people have

202
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,760
different opportunities to contribute to the change in our society and some

203
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,800
people do it dramatically and some people do it in uh

204
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,800
in quiet ways that are not seen recognized or held up as being

205
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,599
exemplars and um some of the more exceptional ways that some people change

206
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,280
the world is uh the accidents of history that they were in the right place at the

207
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:19,319
right time some of it has to do with where they're positioned and elected and

208
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:25,079
all kinds of things that affect them and uh whereas many people are not elected

209
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:34,680
many people are not positioned with the power the influence that a few individuals have but how does

210
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:40,640
how do how does uh individuals how do we involve with change for the

211
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,880
better and uh when I look at my life over with this question uh I've been

212
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:56,000
involved and interested in uh working for social change environmental change

213
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,520
um since I was 19 or so uh when I went to college and

214
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:10,680
began kind of getting a better understanding of what's happening in this world that I had growing up and

215
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,800
um and uh so now it's more than 50 years

216
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,119
since I was 19 and you know to I have the

217
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:27,000
perspective of half a century of what follows that initial impetus to make the

218
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,359
world better place and um and what I'd like to offer you is how I see myself in those 50

219
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:40,400
years uh maybe it's a little hard to believe with the with

220
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:47,720
um uh you know that uh I'm now become kind of a some people say a senior Buddhist teacher and so it might seem

221
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:57,480
like I have a lot of influence in certain ways certain places but I feel that uh uh that my

222
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:04,680
contribution to change uh I'm uh been more of an earthworm or a

223
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:13,240
fungus than you know a gorilla or a

224
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:18,520
elephant that can charge around and do big things and shake the

225
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:24,960
world and um and so you know so a fungus

226
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,079
in the soil uh changes the soil earthworm in the soil changes the soil

227
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:39,000
but it's underground you don't see it so much and um but it's uh essential it's

228
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
it's uh to have fungi it's essential to have earthworms it allows uh the soil to

229
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,200
be healthy allows it to uh we call it uh you know when dead matter leaves and

230
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:59,680
plants fall and die in the soil um they Decay but K really is another word for

231
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:07,079
composting and uh we need fungus to compost and uh digest and to transform

232
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:12,280
the soil so that we can create um a new

233
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,720
world so we can create new uh growths of of seeds and

234
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:23,760
growth and um and it might seem that the conditions of the world are so huge and

235
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,839
Monumental that um it's not okay just to be a fungus just to do the small changes

236
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:37,000
to work on the soil underground and it might seem like we're ignoring the rest of the world we have

237
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,359
to do something we have to stand up we have to make our voice heard we have to demand

238
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:47,680
change but demanding change is that how change happens is that the best way the

239
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,920
only way for it to happen um there are uh so as I've been

240
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,000
this fungus it started off very small and when I first wanted to be some kind

241
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,280
of to offer Buddhism Buddhist practice to respond to the suffering of the world it was I would say in retrospect

242
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:15,440
compared to what I'm doing now it was um uh uh pretty modest I just wanted to

243
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,640
have a storefront Meditation Center uh and uh for it was a Zen Center

244
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,720
I was a Zen priest and keep it clean and have the key that opened it and ring the

245
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:35,079
bells people came to meditate and support people to have a place to meditate I had some profound belief that

246
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:40,319
that was really valuable for people and I wasn't anything more than that that I

247
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:47,119
could imagine myself doing I certainly didn't imagine myself being a teacher and

248
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:53,560
um and then uh so I I engaged and practice and at some point I was invited

249
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,560
to be in a teacher training and that seemed nice and and uh my probably the

250
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,920
highest ambition I had was just to be involved with a local sitting group uh

251
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,920
and mayble support the sitting group or I actually also wanted to just kind of be connected to some of the Buddhist

252
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:16,160
centers in the Bay Area that I'd kind of grow grown up in and be able to support

253
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,200
those centers in some way maybe with some teaching and um and so I was trained to

254
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,280
be a teacher I I started was involved in a sitting group nearby and that sitting

255
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,760
group grew and uh and I just continued being the the earthworm or the fungus

256
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:40,160
and things grew around me and as they grew my influence grew as well as they

257
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,720
grew uh other opportunities could develop and happen and so when the

258
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:51,559
opportunities came then you know we kind of worked on things here at IMC and and

259
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:57,760
without you know making a big thing to do about it and um and now we have

260
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,880
you know uh we've done many many things over the years and had a huge influence

261
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:10,200
in certain kind of ways not particularly in political ways but we've done all kinds of things that have promoted the

262
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:15,680
good in the world that we don't we don't talk about much or celebrate much and

263
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:22,720
I've been to Sacramento to Lobby the governor I've been to train people to work in prisons to

264
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,319
offer um restorative uh Justice programs in

265
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,680
the prisons I've trained people to do mindfulness in the schools we the very

266
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:40,079
first National Conference in mindfulness schools have been here was was not didn't happen here but was planned here

267
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:47,960
organized here from IMC uh we have created chaplaincy programs and sent people to all over the

268
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:53,440
the the world in a sense to uh develop and and offered spiritual care and

269
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:59,040
hospitals and prisons and um

270
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,160
um hospices and many things and so slowly things are growing and we've had

271
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:11,720
kind of false starts we tried to be engaged with engaged Buddhism and there there wasn't much traction for that we

272
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:17,079
created a Buddhist humanitarian organization that had a glorious couple

273
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:22,200
of years of life but then it kind of faltered and now it's dormant for a long

274
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,359
time and uh but as opportunities come this earthworm this fungus that can are

275
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,640
working and doing things um and in the process of it having Buddhist

276
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:41,960
communities that communities now that's spreading across the country a little bit from IMC um and that is spreading this

277
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:48,680
practice of mindfulness of good willll of care uh training people in spiritual

278
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:58,839
care uh skills training teachers to go out into the world and um and maybe it's not enough

279
00:44:58,839 --> 00:45:03,960
maybe we should also have a training in political action I would love to have a

280
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:10,559
program in nonviolent Civil Disobedience that really expresses love and care and

281
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:16,920
um but is the time come for that do we have the conditions for us to do that uh

282
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:24,240
I don't know but uh but we're kind of this earthworm is kind of finding its way seeing what happens and we've

283
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:32,559
started so many things over the years and you know now that I'm 70 how much more can I start than do um but all

284
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:37,680
behind all this and now I'll end is um

285
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,480
uh I believe that it's essential not to

286
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:49,400
sacrifice The Good Will in our own Hearts to not sacrifice a friendly

287
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:56,240
attitude towards all things if there's going to be a change in the world that really is going to for this earthworm

288
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:03,680
the way earthworm ter can change the world um and Earth orbons in the end are probably more and funguses are more

289
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:10,599
important than politicians uh that we have to um uh do

290
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:17,599
the simple ordinary work of love of kindness of Good Will of showing up and

291
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:24,119
being present for our neighbors and our people we see and encounter with

292
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:31,280
um with um uh um with an open heart and that's no

293
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:39,400
small task but if we can't do it do we expecting others to do it if we meet the

294
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:47,880
world with anger if we meet it with horror sense of horror if we meet it with fear if we meet it with

295
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:54,480
despair the unfortunate thing is that's what we spread out into the

296
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:02,960
world and so this practice this spiritual practice that we do in Buddhism is what is meant to support us

297
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:10,520
to find a way to heal our despair to heal our fear to heal our

298
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:16,280
anger uh because it harms ourselves it harms us to do to

299
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:22,839
have those things and in a healthy way to be healed so that we can meet the

300
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:28,040
world with kindness no matter what comes and that's a teaching of the Buddha no

301
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:34,480
matter what the challenge we meet to meet it with Good Will and

302
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:41,040
um so this week to transform the world I'm going to talk about the five

303
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:47,720
different flavors of love that we could have and today it's Goodwill I mentioned

304
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:55,359
briefly here and we did in the guide meditation and um and uh and certainly

305
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:03,440
if some of you can be great I don't know

306
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:10,440
what great powerful effective people for social change certainly do it certainly

307
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:19,720
go out and vote certainly go out and do what you can for our world but let's also be in addition

308
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:26,119
let's be earthworms and funguses composting the anger composting

309
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:32,160
the fear composting that despair so that we can compost it into

310
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:39,559
rich soil for the flowering of love into this world let that

311
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:46,559
be our theory of change to love wherever we

312
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:54,440
go so thank you and uh I look forward to continuing
