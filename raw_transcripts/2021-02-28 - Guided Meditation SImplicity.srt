00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:09,600
so good day everyone and welcome to our sunday morning sitting

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,960
and as we begin this sitting i would like to evoke i believe it's an

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,400
important principle not only of buddhist meditation

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,199
that we teach here and but also of the dharma the teachings of the buddha

5
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:35,120
um you know certainly i think have been important

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,239
part of my practice life and that is the principle

7
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,120
of simplicity that

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,960
even though sometimes the dharma the teachings might seem complicated if that's the case

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:01,199
the hope we have is that their purpose is to point to simplicity perhaps sometimes we're

10
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:09,760
complicated because people are complicated and so to explain to point back to a

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,960
simple way of being a simplicity of being a simplicity of freedom

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,880
that sometimes we meet the complexity with complexity

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:30,720
but to keep in back of the mind you know where is it pointing to that is simple the simplicity of

14
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,759
non-clinging the simplicity of just being with the experience

15
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:45,759
with clear vision with clear seeing it's kind of like turning our gaze

16
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,960
upon whatever is happening and having that gaze

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:58,640
be easeful relaxed at peace with what we see

18
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,960
the gaze itself our wisdom might

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,360
see the complexity of the situation or wisdom might tell us

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,280
what should or shouldn't be done

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:24,720
but not to confuse or entangle the wisdom with the gays

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,319
wisdom with clear seeing

23
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:38,640
and to have this foundation of simplicity as a simple presence

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:47,040
within which wisdom can operate so to take

25
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:57,280
assume a posture that is appropriate for you

26
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:07,519
in allowing your body some ease some simplicity of being

27
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,959
hopefully where there's not much struggle physically to be present

28
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,440
a posture that allows the body to be still

29
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,519
for this duration

30
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:35,120
and if there is no such posture then it's fine to do this meditation

31
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,440
as a form of walking meditation back and

32
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,120
forth and then giving some care

33
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:59,439
to settling into this posture maybe moving the body a little bit

34
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:06,799
rotating swaying back and forth maybe even lifting the shoulders up as

35
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,159
high as you're comfortable and then letting them relax

36
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:21,440
and settle and then gently closing the eyes

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,560
and feeling the foundation under you the solidity the hardness the

38
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,479
firmness that supports the weight of your body

39
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:49,199
such a simple everyday phenomenon that we we live with we navigate through

40
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:59,360
and which in meditation we rely on to help us settle in

41
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,758
the pull of gravity the weight of our body

42
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,720
is something we yield ourselves to and that in the place where the body

43
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,680
makes contact with that support feeling the ground feeling grounded

44
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,840
there rooted

45
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:39,840
and then further up maybe to soften the belly relax your belly

46
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,840
sometimes when you soften relax the belly let it hang forward and down

47
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,720
there's a little bit more of a foundation a base a groundedness

48
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,080
in the lower torso

49
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:20,160
and then softening in the chest softening around the heart

50
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:34,160
you exhale relaxing the shoulders softening the shoulders

51
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,199
releasing the shoulders to the pull of

52
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
gravity

53
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:03,440
and then also as you exhale to soften the muscles of your face

54
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:10,000
the jaws maybe by having the mouth

55
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,160
just open a teeny bit more than it is maybe the lips are still touching but

56
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,960
the teeth a little bit fall away from each other

57
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:35,199
relaxing the cheeks and the muscles around the eyes

58
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,840
letting the eyes eyeballs rest in their sockets

59
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,520
and then you're softening relaxing around the forehead

60
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,240
the temples and even if it doesn't relax easily

61
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,520
maybe on the exhale can be some softening around that area

62
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:27,840
even if it's just the softening of the way we hold it that we're aware of it

63
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,839
and then behind the forehead between the ears the area of the brain

64
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:49,120
feeling whatever sensations there might be there of energy agitation pressure

65
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,839
contraction hardness

66
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,560
and if there's any of those things than on the exhale softening

67
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,839
the brain relaxing that energy

68
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,440
and as you do so

69
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,839
quieting the thinking mind

70
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:46,399
and notice whatever is simple about being here with a modicum of

71
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:54,480
silence where there's nothing to figure out or attain or do

72
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:05,839
but to rest with some ease in the simplicity of this moment

73
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
uh

74
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:44,079
and then within the simplicity of the moment to

75
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:53,519
just center yourself in the body breathing with whatever way it's easy for you or

76
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:01,519
right for you for awareness to be aligned attuned

77
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:15,839
to the body breathing

78
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,959
and no matter how complicated the mind gets with thoughts and ideas

79
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:31,600
keep returning to the simplicity of breathing breathing here

80
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:42,959
and see how simple you can become so simple perhaps that

81
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:50,320
desires fall away aversions fall away

82
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:57,200
expectations fall away

83
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,200
ideas of what is should be and shouldn't be fall away

84
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,760
simplicity where in which everything is allowed to be just the way it is

85
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:20,079
and we gaze upon it kindly

86
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:30,800
we breathe with it breathe through it without getting entangled

87
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:37,200
just here sitting breathing

88
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,839
knowing

89
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:53,839
being simple with how things are

90
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,840
if you've wondered often thought chances are that's a more complicated

91
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,679
world concerns than the simplicity of just

92
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,039
being here being here alive

93
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,480
being here breathing

94
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,840
as if that's enough for just these minutes

95
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,600
and that and then as we come to the end of the sitting

96
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:25,360
maybe using your imagination a little bit and imagine what it would be like

97
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,399
to maintain a simplicity of being

98
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:38,080
a kind of radical simplicity with a kind and clear gaze

99
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,559
of what's happening not needing to understand not needing to

100
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:54,399
fix not needing to explain not needing to defend but to really just be

101
00:31:54,399 --> 00:32:01,200
with clearly with what's happening with someone else

102
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:08,960
what is it like to sit quietly with someone on a park bench maybe it's talking simply and chatting

103
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,559
but offering just a simplicity of being

104
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:21,679
contentment and ease with being alive as if for a few moments

105
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:29,840
at least just to be alive is enough alive and breathing

106
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:41,679
and perhaps with that simplicity of being maybe our good will can be simple as

107
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,039
well a simple warmth and goodness

108
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:54,399
friendliness that doesn't have to be actively expressed and

109
00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:01,200
doesn't have to be explained but a good will and a generosity of

110
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:09,440
spirit a friendliness and a love a care

111
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,080
that maybe is part and parcel of that simplicity

112
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:28,320
and maybe staying simple to end this sitting

113
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:38,880
with tapping into whatever wish you have for others to live well

114
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,080
may all beings be happy

115
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:53,840
may all beings be safe

116
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,000
may all beings be peaceful

117
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:10,560
may all beings everywhere be free

118
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,520
and may it be that we contribute to that

119
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:35,839
and may it be that our practice contributes to that possibility

120
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,440
you
