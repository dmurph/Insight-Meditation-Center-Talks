00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:01,600
welcome

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,200
welcome to our last day on this second

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,320
round of the Poetry of practice it's a

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,080
been a pleasure sharing these poems with

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,840
you this week and today I'll share one

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,800
more there's something about um poetry

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,920
and mindfulness practice that I think

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,080
goes together and that is the poet in my

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,240
view not being a poet myself but in my

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,360
view the

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,000
poet has to like feel into the

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,360
moment has to really be

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,520
present for what it is that they're

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,480
trying to express in order to be able to

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,520
like

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,160
distill the moment into some imagery or

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,120
to some words

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,440
or so in the same way maybe the poet is

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,199
particularly mindful is particularly

20
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,640
present when they're

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,400
writing in the same way that with our

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,439
practice that we are present for what's

23
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,479
happening like letting the

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,240
extraneous I don't know thoughts

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,240
experiences you know just be in the

26
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,600
background and instead to be really

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,680
present for what's

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,960
happening and maybe that's part of the

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,200
reason why

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,320
mindfulness practice and poetry go

31
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,600
together they both have

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,600
this property of

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,040
presence and

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,040
distillation

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,560
maybe so well that is an introduction

36
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,600
let's

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,920
uh do some meditation as you know I'll

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,159
drop in a poem after we've been settled

39
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,039
and I've had some amount of silence and

40
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,360
then I'll drop in a poem into our

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,920
meditation but again we'll start

42
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,120
by taking a meditation

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,719
posture a posture that

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,200
expresses Our

45
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,800
intention to be

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,760
present in this moment

47
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,440
taking this posture and can be helpful

48
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,640
to have a

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,239
few long slow

50
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,120
exhales there a way in which exhaling

51
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,599
kind of like supports the arising of

52
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,640
ease maybe in some way expelling some

53
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,760
tension or tightness

54
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,879
tuning into this bodily

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,720
experience bringing some presence some

56
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,680
embodiment to this moment

57
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,640
feeling connected to

58
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:16,000
grounded with this base this seating

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,639
base the

60
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,639
foundation two feet on the ground with

61
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,240
the buttocks

62
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,360
or if you're sitting in a chair or or if

63
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,160
you're sitting cross-legged

64
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,840
the buts and

65
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,919
two other areas maybe the calf the side

66
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:41,320
of the

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,240
leg what would it be like to tune into

68
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
the sense of

69
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,960
stability in this moment even if you're

70
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,800
walking and if you're lying down sense

71
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,800
of

72
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,840
balance a

73
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
brightness

74
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,759
and then tuning into the move movement

75
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,160
within that

76
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,960
stability the movement of the sensations

77
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,120
of

78
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,290
breathing the chest

79
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,639
[Music]

80
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,479
moving or the belly

81
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,440
moving for some of you you might be

82
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,039
feeling the sensations of the air going

83
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,400
in and out of the

84
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
nose

85
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,880
just allowing that experience to be

86
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,040
[Music]

87
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,039
known more of a receiving the experience

88
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,400
than going out and getting it

89
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,478
receiving in a relaxed open spacious

90
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
manner

91
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,340
it wouldn't be

92
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,720
[Music]

93
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,479
surprising if the mind was

94
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,479
wondering it's

95
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,080
okay you just very simply

96
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,560
gently begin

97
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,680
again it doesn't matter how many times

98
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,199
we begin

99
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,919
again this is simply the

100
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,440
practice beginning

101
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,400
again and again and

102
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
again

103
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,839
and can we imbue this

104
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,480
experience an attitude of care an

105
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,760
attitude of warmth an attitude of

106
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,120
kindness towards

107
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
ourself

108
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,200
no need to

109
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,200
parate

110
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,959
chastise instead an opportunity to have

111
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,680
kindness love for

112
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,399
ourselves as best we

113
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,920
can

114
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
as best we

115
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,200
can without insisting on

116
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,200
perfection
