6

9
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,698
foreign

10
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:38,459
so if you have any routine ways of relaxing or directing attention

11
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:42,539
that helps you establish

12
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:52,820
sense of embodiment mindfulness please uh please do that

13
00:10:52,579 --> 00:11:00,620
and if there's anything that needs awareness is blessing

14
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:06,320
in order for you to put it down

15
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,320
and give that blessing

16
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,560
something that's recently happened something you're anticipating big

17
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,940
existential questions and issues

18
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,579
it's not that blessing with awareness resolves it ties up the Loose Ends of

19
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:45,480
Being Human but it's that we make enough peace with

20
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,760
it that the attention

21
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,760
is no longer compulsively pulled there

22
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,740
we can become available or our life

23
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,820
In This Moment

24
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:49,940
body in the posture mind in the body

25
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,459
relaxation in the mind

26
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:38,180
to the present bird is to momentarily give up

27
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:44,240
hope for clinging

28
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:14,880
some part of our mind as these utopian fantasies

29
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,120
about what clinging might be able to get us

30
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,438
the Buddha says

31
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,360
not so much

32
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:00,960
and sometimes we have to mourn the truth

33
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:09,320
that are clinging cannot work out the way we hope

34
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:29,460
but in our relaxation in our

35
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,600
letting go

36
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,080
the settledness of equanimity

37
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,760
we received the Dharma

38
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,658
those blessings

39
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:31,559
and all the anxiety and agitation bound up with the sense of needing

40
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:37,880
to steer and control our life Moment by moment

41
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,700
starts to Fall Away

42
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:55,100
our heart becomes more and more are available

43
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:21,059
and uh poignancy of our life

44
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:24,059
dawned

45
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:37,940
our hopes and fears become

46
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:46,640
Maybe less entangling

47
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,259
but still poignant

48
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,120
in a sense of self becomes less entangling

49
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,559
but poignant

50
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:26,059
rather than reaching out to control the moment

51
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,820
we're willing to receive it be changed by it

52
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:47,600
and says something in the heart rests

53
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,880
[Music]

54
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,520
foreign

55
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,920
so it's good to uh good to see with you um

56
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:57,599
so last uh last time I was here uh just a few weeks ago I did

57
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,820
uh the um series on the five five spiritual

58
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:08,880
faculties of faith and energy mindfulness samadi concentration wisdom

59
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,660
and when deciding what to uh what to teach just generally like I kind of

60
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:21,839
float this balloon in my mind little trial balloon

61
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:27,000
and then imagine the Sangha imagine speaking to

62
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,460
that theme and um and try to feel into that and

63
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:38,099
this time like all my balloons all the trial balloons immediately kind of

64
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:45,300
deflated and fell to the ground I didn't know what to teach so I um I

65
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,800
made up a list not official by any stretch

66
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,880
[Music] um kind of factors that don't show up in uh

67
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:03,780
in the list but from what I can see lead us deeper into uh

68
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:10,820
into the direct path and so today is uh

69
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:18,300
awe and wonder it's the researcher

70
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:25,500
um Decker Keltner uh oah is the feeling of Wonder and

71
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:32,940
amazement of being in the presence of something that something vast that transcends one's current understanding

72
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:38,940
as part of a family of states that includes elevation appreciation and

73
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:45,900
admiration the majority of all experiences occur in response to Nature other people who

74
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:54,000
display virtuosity or Magnum magnanimity art and music religious experiences and

75
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,220
ideas similar to other pro-social emotions like gratitude compassion

76
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:09,300
are reliably predicts increased sharing assistance and generosity

77
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:15,780
so awe on this path we

78
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:23,060
we develop I would say a kind of awe for the Dharma

79
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:30,240
I I remember early early in practice maybe I don't know a year into practice

80
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,579
or something I was at a weekend retreat with Galen

81
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:40,640
Ferguson and the Tibetan tradition and

82
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:47,220
Galen is uh I think a professor and was a professor

83
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:55,800
he is a full-time Dharma person very beautiful teacher quite buttoned up you know kind of and

84
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:03,140
um the weekend was on the unity of of shamata and insight the unity of the the

85
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:10,079
tranquilizing and the Insight side of the path and it touched me quite deeply and

86
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:18,119
afterwards I kind of approached him crying and sort of rambling and just

87
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:25,859
trying to express something something what he had done to my heart and

88
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:32,760
uh I was trying trying unsuccessfully to say something like

89
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:38,520
I'm falling in love with the Dharma you're helping

90
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,859
I wasn't able to say that and just kind of

91
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:51,240
sat there a little messy in his uh kind presence and he said something like oh

92
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:58,079
yeah um gazing out over the vastness of the

93
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,420
Dharma ocean you know that can be a lot

94
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:10,940
and in a Dharma life we we

95
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:21,000
develop a sense of awe for the path awe for awareness itself

96
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:29,280
the the sense of how um how close the distance

97
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:38,240
from suffering to peace can be in a given moment

98
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:47,180
it feels so far and yet we come to know it as being so close

99
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,800
and the potency of of awareness becomes

100
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,160
a kind of object of of all

101
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:05,960
this life this life this life we are somehow given

102
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,420
I remember again early in practice I think from the Tibetan tradition the

103
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:20,540
image of being born human is like a turtle swimming in the great ocean that

104
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:26,359
breaches the surface of the water once every century

105
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:33,780
and happening to poke its head through a small ring floating in the vastness of

106
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:40,859
the ocean the chance of that is like the

107
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:48,560
preciousness of being born human with this possibility to wake up

108
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:56,339
and so yeah there is wonder wonder for having been born Wonder for

109
00:42:56,339 --> 00:43:01,160
the possibilities of Being Human

110
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:08,700
and wonder or the question of like how might I live

111
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:16,980
how might I live we're so so hemmed in so constrained by

112
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:23,160
prevailing narratives and cultural assumptions and the the seeming

113
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:32,040
foundations of a human life but in Buddhism uh

114
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:38,900
the the foundation of all things is empty

115
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:45,660
and so what if what if everything I consider

116
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:53,160
natural and customary the right way everything I consider to be self-evident

117
00:43:53,160 --> 00:44:01,079
to be common sense is empty empty

118
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:10,020
the the kind of usually translated as attachment to rights and rituals

119
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:15,900
um and has said said to be shed at stream entry the kind of first uh real

120
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:23,300
taste of enlightenment see the Bata paramasa

121
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:31,200
kind of endowing all the conventions of our life with um more

122
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:38,579
and in a way our entire culture is silabata paramasa

123
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:45,420
and when we recognize the the groundlessness of all convention

124
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:52,700
there's a lot of wonder how might I live

125
00:44:53,180 --> 00:45:00,240
unconstrained by this attachment to Convention how might

126
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:07,859
I live wonder wonder is uh is an especially

127
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:15,920
clean engine for our motivation and Dharma effort

128
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:22,140
clinging of course is the Buddha says is at the heart of

129
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:29,819
suffering but how do we avoid trying to cling our way to peace

130
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:39,780
so many of the moves that we can make on our experience the Dharma moves we make

131
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:45,300
in one way or another express some clinging

132
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:54,740
and wonder wonder this deep abiding interest

133
00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:03,060
this is a very powerful place to practice from and I I feel you know in my capacity as

134
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:10,440
a teacher when people become interested in their minds my job is kind of done relegated

135
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:17,460
uh primarily to just being a cheerleader and I like that role

136
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:23,119
but it's um there's something that happens when we like are interested

137
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:30,480
interested in our minds there's no real agenda and interest in

138
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:37,440
wonder and this uh is a powerful

139
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:44,359
condition for the arising of wisdom and love

140
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:56,400
ah is associated with the the sense of self becoming smaller sense of self

141
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:02,099
becoming smaller sometimes this is seen you know in the

142
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:09,060
classically gazing up at the stars or something and um

143
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:17,460
it says an astronomer she writes um our galaxies located at one end of the

144
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:22,500
local group a small cluster of galaxies with the Andromeda galaxy at the other

145
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:28,740
end the local group is near the outskirts of the local supercluster

146
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:35,900
which has a diameter of a hundred million light years the biggest supercluster is the Perseus

147
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:41,460
Pegasus filament which stretches for roughly a billion light years a number

148
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:47,339
of other super clusters and voids are known but astronomers have only mapped

149
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:54,420
the large-scale structure of a small part of the universe there may even be larger scale

150
00:47:54,420 --> 00:48:02,960
structures to really you know just to really 100

151
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:09,780
billion light years whatever to really take that in it's um

152
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:17,400
it's tough tougher to get too lost in the details

153
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:24,000
of a particular life but um

154
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:33,060
but here's the thing the self-becoming smaller means the world gets much much

155
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:40,940
bigger much much bigger the less the less clinging

156
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,078
the more life

157
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:54,980
and so we discuss we we wake up to awe in the face of the vastness there

158
00:48:55,079 --> 00:49:00,720
awe in the face of the vastness of of suffering

159
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:08,300
it just brings you to your knees

160
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:16,800
and awe in the face of love to know how vast our love might become even though

161
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:23,400
it does not resolve samsara does not tie up the

162
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,838
Loose Ends of Being Human

163
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:37,800
but to be kind of humbled how vast our love might become

164
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,839
