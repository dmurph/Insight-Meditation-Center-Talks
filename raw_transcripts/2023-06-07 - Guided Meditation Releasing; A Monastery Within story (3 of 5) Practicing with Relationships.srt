1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:09,139
greetings good morning good day everyone

2
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:19,279
welcome Sangha to our 7 A.M meditation and they're met

3
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:33,899
so I assume that you're able to hear me if there is a few responses in the chat

4
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,218
box that be helpful

5
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,100
I've been feeling very intimate to this morning's and to meditate and

6
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,780
practice together learning together

7
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:05,120
so thank you thank you for letting me know that I can be heard

8
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:13,619
so whipping uh using this list of r words in our meditation

9
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:20,340
in the morning and so uh last a couple of days we went

10
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,860
through relaxing and recognizing

11
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:33,720
and today in our progression I will add yet another r word

12
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:42,479
which is releasing and so there is a progression uh in our

13
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,540
meditative process where when our body mind and heart

14
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,659
become more and more relaxed and there's a surface of levels of

15
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,880
agitation began to calm down settle down

16
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,579
it's like the water become the mud began to settle down to the

17
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:11,940
bottom of the lake and so that allows for Clear seeing

18
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,879
and so we can begin to recognize what's in the field

19
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:28,980
and recognize the fish swimming or the oysters moving or the sea grass moving

20
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:37,980
um and just like that when the relaxation deepens there can be a sense of clear

21
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:47,819
recognition of what's Happening and maybe one of the important aspect of

22
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:57,780
our practice is to begin to recognize the forces of cleaning grasping and

23
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:05,420
craving and when those are recognized

24
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,819
at the same time they can be released so releasing

25
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:17,879
is this a dimension of kind of the movements that come when

26
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:23,700
there is a clear recognition of the forces of a grasping claiming

27
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:31,640
and the forces of a grasping cleaning have many forms of manifestations

28
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:39,239
um I'm using quite abstract a word clinging grasping craving

29
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:47,280
but in our manifest world we can begin to feel how it feels in our

30
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,060
embodied sense maybe there are certain kind of extra

31
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,239
um instructions somewhere in the body or there may be certain sense of

32
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,519
heightening that can be released

33
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:13,080
and so today and our meditation a kind of a

34
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:21,060
if you take on this a tours of three r's relaxing recognizing

35
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,240
and releasing whatever that may be released in terms of

36
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,199
extra tension and grasping and wherever you are it's perfectly fine

37
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:42,720
and it doesn't mean that you have to be somewhere in this sequence of ours or

38
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,680
the map of ours but wherever you are is wholesome

39
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:58,400
so let's begin to take a meditative posture

40
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:07,380
maybe take a first a few moments to just arrive at your seat

41
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,780
arrive in a space you're in

42
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,719
arriving Here and Now

43
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:32,360
as if you're entering into a monastery within yourself

44
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,940
a monastery of this body mind and heart

45
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,340
a temple Within

46
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,900
maybe there's a metaphor immediately evokes

47
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,759
some sense of irreverence

48
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,419
there may be some sense of quieting

49
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:30,680
as you enter into the Temple of this body mind and heart

50
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:37,340
take your seat right here

51
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,380
the initial face of our practice

52
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:02,520
involves relaxing the body

53
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,660
in however way that might manifest itself

54
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:28,460
we can do a body scan while inviting relaxation

55
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,020
or you can simply sit

56
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:53,660
and the offering and invitation to relax

57
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,000
it's helpful to relax the body

58
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,680
if there are certain parts of the body that tends to be

59
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,720
tightened

60
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:32,180
out something gentle

61
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,080
invitation to relax

62
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,019
relaxing the mind

63
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,779
relaxing the heart

64
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:22,279
maybe relaxing the mind refers to relaxing the thinking muscles

65
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:29,940
maybe muscles around skull

66
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,879
neck

67
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:49,380
some parts of the body were thinking

68
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,660
seem to be associated with

69
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,180
relaxing the heart

70
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:24,019
gently breathing through the heart

71
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,320
as the body becomes calmer

72
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,000
more is settled

73
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,660
it's natural that mindfulness

74
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,600
began to come to the foreground

75
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,459
present aware

76
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:32,220
and began to recognize the dancing movements

77
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,740
Sensations in the body

78
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,720
and temperature on the hands

79
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,920
warmth in the Palms

80
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:23,100
the touch points that have a sense of a pressure and

81
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:31,019
tingling of the body against the floor chairs

82
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,019
beds

83
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:04,760
recognizing each experience as they arise and pass away

84
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:33,200
being a relaxed and easeful field

85
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:41,160
the recognition comes naturally

86
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,339
there may be a slight height and declarity

87
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,839
our sensitivity

88
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,560
to the experiences in the body in the mind and heart

89
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:05,480
noticing any Pleasant or unpleasant experiences

90
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,320
arising and passing

91
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,300
and also noticing what happens

92
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:33,660
as the pleasant and unpleasant experiences arise

93
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,399
they're extra efforting that's happening

94
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,740
and that's a form of grasping

95
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,199
that can be released

96
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:43,320
my very tightening to the experience the object of your

97
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,799
experience

98
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:56,120
that is a form of grasping that can be released

99
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:28,280
are there forms of Leaning into

100
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,600
the objects of experience

101
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:43,279
that is a form of cleaning

102
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,380
that can be released

103
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,400
simple relaxed

104
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,660
recognition

105
00:19:52,200 --> 00:20:00,440
with a relaxed easeful clear recognition

106
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,880
there arises Stillness

107
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,659
silence Within

108
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:48,500
yeah the mind that gets caught up in the stories

109
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,320
and the stories be released

110
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,919
and the mind is caught up in judging

111
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:42,000
comparing evaluating [Music]

112
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:50,720
of fixing and they'd be released

113
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:51,140
noticing what it feels like when the extra tension

114
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,640
grasping are released

115
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:03,620
maybe just a hint of how it might feel like

116
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,139
maybe just a possibility

117
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,799
in the opening of the heart

118
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,059
quieting of the Mind

119
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,340
maybe some sense of a Stillness

120
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,860
away into our Stillness

121
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:54,320
I go walking into a peaceful Temple

122
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,940
this process of a relaxing recognizing

123
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:45,620
[Music] and releasing

124
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:55,460
allow us to settle into deeper aspects of our being

125
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:05,419
that are otherwise constantly stirred up and hard to get in touch with

126
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:25,500
as you receive the sound of the Bell to signify the end of the sitting

127
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:32,220
together you're welcome to abide

128
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:40,140
in this Monastery Within to receive the stories

129
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,299
from a monastery Within

130
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,500
foreign

131
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:29,559
[Music]

132
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:10,320
exploring this theme of a multi-dimensional nature of the Dharma

133
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:18,659
practice and Dharma practice path and yesterday I shared this story from

134
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:28,260
Anne Gil's book a monastery Within about how does a 30 year old man who was

135
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:36,600
overwhelmed by his family life particularly the two children and wanted

136
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:43,860
to escape to the monastery to find a relief

137
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:51,539
but the Abba to send him out back out after a seven day solitary retreat

138
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:57,020
and the officer sent him back out to his family

139
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:05,580
and told him that [Music] um his family is his best teacher that's

140
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,980
where you'll find spiritual strength and the freedom

141
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:17,820
and so today will continue a bit in this dimension in

142
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:23,700
visiting and today and this character in the

143
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:29,399
story is not someone who was trying to escape from

144
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:36,720
from the monastery in fact that the person that was having a really good time in the monastery

145
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:44,220
but Abbas decided again to send him out because that's

146
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:50,460
his Monastery that's where his Monastery is and so

147
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:57,899
I'm going to read to this story and then I'll offer some reflections

148
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,658
the brilliant Monk a young man once came to the monastery

149
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:17,820
to ordain as a monk he had been raised in relatively

150
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,980
fortunate circumstances with easy access to education

151
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:29,940
capable smart and a friendly he succeeded in most everything he set

152
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:37,020
his mind to deeply reflective about life he had to study the teachings of the

153
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:44,520
major religions in his early twenties he decided not to follow the customary path of marriage

154
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:51,300
and a career leaving behind the life he had known

155
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:58,020
he ordained at the age of 22 and applied himself to the meditation

156
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:03,980
and the training the training the monastery provided

157
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:11,880
disciplined intent and intelligent he made quick progress in the spiritual

158
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:19,859
practice monks and nuns who had been there for years were in awe of how quickly he

159
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:25,859
settled into deep meditation within three months of entering the

160
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:31,560
monastery he experiences the first taste of enlightenment

161
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:37,920
immediately the app is grabbed the young monk dragged him out the front gate

162
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,780
without explanation kicked him out of the monastery

163
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:54,240
um later addressing the residence of a monastery the app is explained

164
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,480
the new Monk's realization was genuine and I'm quite happy for him

165
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,700
however in order for him to mature further along

166
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,740
the path of liberation he has to return to the world

167
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:16,500
to experience more of the difficulties and sufferings of life

168
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:22,200
to understand all the corners of his own heart

169
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:28,020
he has to grabble with issues of livelihood family

170
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:33,599
and community life furthermore

171
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,060
I expect that someday he will be a great teacher

172
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:46,440
but for this to happen he has to understand all those issues so that he

173
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:54,060
can have greater compassion and insight into the lives of his students

174
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:59,880
for this particular Monk this is not going to happen in the

175
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,480
monastery

176
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:09,260
this Abyss is a pretty dramatic

177
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:12,980
um

178
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,099
and reading this story I was asking myself you know what is

179
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:30,839
great Fortune hard to say right for This brilliant monk

180
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:37,680
um a smooth the fast track was quite nice you know quite nice

181
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:45,599
for a while and all the life fortunes

182
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:52,020
quite nice for a while yeah to the Dharma is

183
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:58,460
much bigger broader richer and deeper

184
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:10,380
and so having a deep meditative experiences and knowledge is great I don't want to

185
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:17,460
dismiss any of that yet as the story says

186
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:25,619
to understand all the corners of his own heart it has to Grapple with the issues of

187
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:31,578
livelihood family and the communities

188
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:41,040
and so for me what is pointing at is that The Liberation happens when the

189
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:48,420
majority of the whole being the holistic being ripens

190
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:55,380
and so there's no such a thing as a kind of a conditional liberation

191
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:03,660
you're only liberated if your neighbors dogs stop barking or

192
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:11,940
when you live in a constant 70 degree temperature the room

193
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:18,599
or when you can have I know what your favorite food once every

194
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:28,579
five days and so Liberation is not conditioned

195
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:35,660
whatever the conditions that we kind of hope that they have to be

196
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:43,200
into in this way maybe all of us are fortunate enough

197
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,680
that we're practicing Dharma with good enough conditions

198
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:57,599
in this world maybe having a livelihood a family and

199
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:06,000
communities to Grapple with and this is the monastery where we can

200
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,380
um engage in a way that has strengthen our

201
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:19,320
heart and mind and so today in particular I wanted to

202
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:27,839
maybe say a few words about practicing in the relational field

203
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:34,800
and so this monk in a rather secluded a monastery may not have had the chance to

204
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:41,359
deal with wide range of kind of relational field

205
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:51,020
and so for me I can definitely say that practicing in the relational field

206
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:58,500
whether it's in the family in local communities or in Dharma communities

207
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,839
I think so rewarding

208
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:13,320
that the very factor that we're here together in this virtual way we're creating a

209
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:21,480
virtual community as a social beings so we're living in

210
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:28,680
the relational field we always influence each other and the being influenced by

211
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:34,220
each other and so practicing in this relational

212
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:41,520
Dynamic has many many benefits and so for me I definitely would not

213
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:48,560
have been able to practice without the support of a communities

214
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:57,000
we mirror each other and we're married back by each other

215
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,480
and so right now and just knowing your presence right

216
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:09,839
here in This Global field that work co-creating

217
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:15,560
so uplifting so inspiring

218
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:24,500
and so in this way what kind of our practice is a collective path

219
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:32,640
even while each of us have a unique unfolding but there's a collective path is

220
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:38,839
unfolding right here in this relational field

221
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:46,260
and when we're practicing in the relational field it also offers great

222
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:52,619
opportunities for us to work with the challenges that come along

223
00:42:52,619 --> 00:43:01,760
and we get to open the corners of our heart that are otherwise may not be touched

224
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:09,000
as soon as we engage in the relational field at the communities

225
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,819
will have will meet differences disagreements

226
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:22,619
likes and dislikes preferences like this yesterday's story where the 30

227
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:31,200
year old man so having a very hard time to accept to his older son's behavior and I

228
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:37,260
consider them as unacceptable unacceptable

229
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:43,260
and the story didn't make it very detailed elaboration about what the

230
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:47,720
behavior behaviors might be

231
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:55,640
how many times we are considering other people's behavior unacceptable

232
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:01,380
because we had a fixed abuse or something

233
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:07,140
it's not necessarily that they're doing anything harmful they're just different

234
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:16,020
I remember for a while when my son was young and he loves to eat with his hands

235
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:21,079
and I had this idea that it's not clean

236
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:26,819
but the Buddha ate with his hands there's still Billings of the people on

237
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:34,200
this planet eating with their hands is that unacceptable

238
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:41,180
is that I had to change my own view on this

239
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:48,960
and so how can we live with the differences without harboring

240
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,780
ill will anchor hatred aversion

241
00:44:54,780 --> 00:45:01,200
how can we live with the differences while still being in harmony with each

242
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,680
other this is certainly not easy to do

243
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:14,420
that it's such a worthy dimension of the practice to open up to

244
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:23,040
when we become more and more skillful in our relational World relational fields

245
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:30,200
the benefit will Ripple out into the World At Large

246
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:36,319
it's such a beneficial Force for the World At Large

247
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:44,520
so may the collective practicing force that were engaged in together

248
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:49,400
bring benefit to all beings everywhere

249
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:58,140
thank you for your attention and deep bows to your practice and your

250
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:04,640
engagement and I'll see you tomorrow

251
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:09,619
bye bye everyone
