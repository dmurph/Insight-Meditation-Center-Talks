1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,840
so let's do uh some

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,040
meditation maybe there's a way that there's a little wiggling of the body as

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,119
we like settle into our meditation

4
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,960
posture some bigger breaths as we connect to the sensations of breathing

5
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,000
connect to the

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,960
body and tuning into the connections with our Cain

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,320
surface whatever that surface might be

8
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:07,118
the couch floor the

9
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:17,159
bed maybe even some of you are walking probably not driving but

10
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:28,159
walking I find it can make a big difference to really feel the foundation

11
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:35,280
upon which I'm sitting and to feel grounded and I'm

12
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,680
here which also means

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,280
now feeling the feet on the ground

14
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:13,520
feel in the back of the legs the contact with the sitting

15
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,599
surface the Bic the pressure

16
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,800
of the cushion chair seat whatever it might be

17
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,879
L that against the

18
00:02:51,400 --> 00:03:00,920
body and if you're using a back rest pressure against the back

19
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,599
opening to Sensations in the

20
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,000
face we often hold tension around the eyes or the jaw

21
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:49,439
it might be that bringing awareness to areas that have

22
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,560
tension help soften or loosen the tension

23
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,879
it might not be

24
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,879
also can we not be tense about having

25
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,280
tension cheen in with the neck

26
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:43,080
for me I like to move my chin like directly back not up or down

27
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,840
but back just a tiny

28
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,680
bit opens up the neck and it's a little bit more speed

29
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,360
the shoulders letting them relax and move

30
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,280
away from the ears shoulder blades sliding down the

31
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,280
back

32
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,840
justest can it be just a tiny bit more

33
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:04,960
open moving the should shoulders back maybe it's not even perceptible by

34
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:14,800
another person if they were to be looking at you this really small movement

35
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,360
something

36
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,520
resting attention on the sensations of

37
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:21,000
breathing noticing how the body breathes noticing the

38
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,240
experience the sensations no words are needed

39
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,479
e

40
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:53,240
feeling into the experience breathing

41
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:01,440
noticing the stretch and the release of the stretch

42
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,639
as we inhale and

43
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
exhale

44
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,360
e e

45
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,760
when you find yourself lost in

46
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:48,959
thought no need to make a story about what it means about you as a

47
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,399
meditator or this meditation

48
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,240
session we just Begin Again

49
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,360
with the sensations of

50
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:15,120
breathing the experience of

51
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
breathing

52

00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,519
Bing pretty particular needs to be

54
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:15,680
happening or just noticing the experience of

55
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
breathing

part of this tradition

60
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,920
the story of the Buddha

61
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,519
meditating under a

62
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:20,759
tree is there a way that you can feel

63
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:28,399
supported encouraged knowing that countless

64
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:36,360
individual have been doing this practice

65
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:42,680
sitting literally or figuratively under a

66
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,079

[Music]

94
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,240
morning welcome welcome

95
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:51,720
again so I'm continuing on this series about

96
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,360
stories and in the preceding days I earlier in the week I spoke about you

97
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,600
know I gave few stories and sort of to talk about the role of stories have in

98
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:08,559
our lives and our relationship to them and I'll do the same today with a

99
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,600
different story and that is the story of the

100
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,480
Buddha's path to Awakening and uh as you may know

101
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:26,000
different uh Buddhist Traditions have different versions of this story and um I'll talk a little bit more

102
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,640
about that in a moment but um I'm going to give one version of this

103
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,039
story as you know there's different versions of different ways I could do

104
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:44,679
this so this version of the story is in one that if um it's not uncommon uh in

105
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:50,200
this lineage this tradition is that the the Buddha was a historical figure like

106
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,880
somebody who existed who Scholars will say died in

107
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:03,200
483 in the before the Comm era so you know about 2600 years

108
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:11,440
ago and his name was sidartha ktima and he was a human he lived and died just

109
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,159
like humans do so he wasn't a God in particular or he wasn't born from a God

110
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:25,799
or something like this but was a human just like we are and but he uh during

111
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:32,519
the course of his life made some discoveries about Freedom peace Nana

112
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:38,760
Nirvana and these discoveries were very practical and profound and

113
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:45,440
groundbreaking so over the ages people have felt compelled to have shared of

114
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,240
his teachings including the story of his

115
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:58,960
Awakening and in some ways uh we might say that this story has become

116
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,799
um maybe little bit more myth than fact or I don't know but it doesn't mean that

117
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:13,679
we uh can't be inspired by or moved by his life and his uh Discovery so the

118
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:21,760
Story begins with this person Sara Goa who uh was a prince that was in Northern

119
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:28,720
India probably what is [Music] in in modern times at Nepal and he lived

120
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:36,240
a very sheltered life he lived in his Palace and he was was very pampered and

121
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,840
had a life that um made him not really experience some of the difficulties of

122
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,960
his life and so it wasn't until he was a young adult that uh he really

123
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,519
encountered what we sometimes call like the Heavenly Messengers that he encountered old age sickness and

124
00:31:54,519 --> 00:32:00,320
death and in some versions of the story The put in a fourth Heavenly messenger

125
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:07,679
uh so a monastic somebody who was uh had some great peace but having encountered old age

126
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,039
sickness and death while he was out on a ride in a chariot being driven by a

127
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:18,639
chariot driver of course he was a prince so uh he didn't drive himself he was

128
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:24,639
driven around but he was deeply troubled by seeing this old age sickness and

129
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:31,399
death and realized my goodness you know this is going to happen to me as well

130
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:38,880
and everybody that I care about and everybody that's important to me and there's got to be a way out of this this

131
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,039
suffering of knowing this impending old AG sickness and death and or if there

132
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:51,559
people who are already experiencing old age and sickness maybe see a death on

133
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:57,960
the horizon there's got to be a way out of this suffering out of the difficulties of

134
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:04,559
this so he left his this Palace this beautiful palace where everything he had

135
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,960
was a catered to apparently in this quest to go find the end of this

136
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:17,720
suffering of this part of the suffering that's uh The Human Condition and it's noteworthy that he

137
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:25,639
left behind a wife and a baby the wife was uh named yasodara and the baby was

138
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:30,840
named rahula so after he uh left he discovered some

139
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:37,039
meditation Masters and he studied uh meditation with them and becoming

140
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:43,559
incredibly proficient and the first meditation Master said well you know you're as good as I am now maybe you can

141
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:50,240
teach with me but uh the person who is to become the Buddha the bodh

142
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,440
S said like yeah you know but I haven't found the end of this suffering so he went to the next meditation Master uh

143
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:06,880
who taught a little bit further a little bit more depth than what the first one had and uh acquired the same skills and

144
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:14,040
the second meditation Master meditation Master said okay well you're so good maybe you can teach with me or another

145
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,520
teacher and person who was to become the Buddha said nope I haven't found an end of

146
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,520
suffering so he continued on his quest and then uh said that maybe he

147
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:33,200
would try some extreme asceticism and which included uh not

148
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,358
eating and he nearly starved himself to death and you can find statues of him

149
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:44,280
being incredibly emaciated with with his ribs and all his bones are really being

150
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:50,638
uh predominant and but he still couldn't he was near

151
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,720
death and still hadn't found an end to suffering and he just found more suffering

152
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:04,599
really but then uh had this memory of when he was a young person having uh

153
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:09,760
was often I said the first jna this meditative experience where there wasn't

154
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:17,720
suffering there's this incredible ease and some joy and some happiness and he had the sense of maybe

155
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:25,320
that's the direction that's the direction to go but he was so uh emaciated he didn't

156
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:31,160
really have this strength so uh young woman as it happened encounters him in

157
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:37,400
this near starvation near death and offers him some rice milk he takes the

158
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:44,000
rice milk and starts uh regaining some of his health eating a little bit more

159
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
and then he when he had enough strength he sat with this incredible

160
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,440
determination under a bod tree like a ficus religiosa I think is

161
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:02,760
the name this is a type of a Fus that I'm sitting next to here too and he set up with this incredible

162
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:10,440
determination okay I'm not going to move until I become awakened and while he is sitting there

163
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:16,359
he becomes attacked by Mara can say is this a personification of difficulties

164
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:21,839
or things that get in the way of a hindrances some traditions hold that

165
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,839
Mara is a demonic uh figure but uh I personally don't have that view I just

166
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:33,800
that representing what uh gets in the way and Mara is throwing all these uh

167
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:40,800
terrible things towards him there's different versions of the story but some of them you like a mud

168
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,040
and fire and all these things are getting thrown at the Buddha and somehow

169
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:53,480
he's able to meet them in such a way that uh they get transformed into flowers and instead the Just Flowers

170
00:36:53,480 --> 00:37:01,599
fall near to his uh seat and at one point he like touches the ground and

171
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:07,440
some as the Earth is my witness I'm going to become awakened and

172
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:13,240
he becomes awakened so that's the version of the

173
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:18,800
story that bana is telling on this uh Wednesday morning there's so many

174
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,160
different versions of the story and that uh maybe on another day I might uh

175
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:30,920
include other details and not include other details but one thing that's interesting

176
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:37,280
about this I think that um some of you know that like in this tradition and and

177
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,720
I would say in particular Gil Fran's lineage there's an emphasis on the sutas

178
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:49,760
there's emphasis on the poly Canon some of you know that Gil and I just we spent a number of years talking about the

179
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:57,599
majima Naya we offered a course on the majaya and um we've in other settings

180
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,160
have done of course on the samut Naya and the de Naya and a lot of stuff uh

181
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,800
with the suit do you might be surprised to learn that so much of what that story

182
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,880
that I just told about the Buddha and his quest for awakening is not in the

183
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:21,599
poly Canon some of those elements are there but uh they're attributed to other

184
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,640
people it's their part of other people's stories and some of it is just simply isn't there including this named sedara

185
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,480
Goa the name sadara is not in the poly Canon we just have um Goa some people

186
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,520
pronounce it gotama but in poly we would say

187
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:46,599
go so this for me is all fascinating well our tradition has the story We

188
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:52,440
value the PO Canon and yet the story is not from the PO Canon the story of the

189
00:38:52,440 --> 00:39:00,000
Buddha's Awakening in the poly Canon has a different emphasis about some of his medit ative practices and how he worked

190
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,160
with fear and some of these types things so you know as maybe the story of

191
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:14,760
the Buddha's Awakening as is true of all Stories the person who is telling it tends to

192
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:21,880
emphasize those aspects that speak to them those aspects that uh tend to think

193
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:29,480
are important and maybe like disregard those other aspects so I didn't talk about any Supernatural elements for me

194
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:36,000
that's uh not what's inspiring for me what's inspiring is the fact that the Buddha was a

195
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,280
human I'm a human you guys are humans right and there's for me like

196
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,680
this the potential for awakening the potential to find greater peace and ease

197
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,560
and freedom is really meaningful and inspiring for me and the fact that uh

198
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:02,040
this the Buddha story is a I feel uh inspired by so one thing

199
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:08,960
I want to talk about is how stories create connections they serve as a bridge but

200
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:16,280
connect individuals a bridge like through time or through geography through cultures a way in which we can

201
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:24,760
find some of these common elements some of you might recognize that this version of the Buddha's Awakening is a Heroes

202
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:32,240
Journey that is where this which is an archetypal you know story like Through the Ages that individuals have a person

203
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,240
embarks on a journey overcomes various challenges and then undergoes uh

204
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,839
personal growth and transformation these types of stories really resonate with us there's a reason

205
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:50,400
why Star Wars was so popular right this typical uh Heroes

206
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:57,880
Journey so that's one way in which they create connection is there these archetypes but there's also other ways

207
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:03,480
in which stories really create connections and some is that they um

208
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,800
represent or evoke emotions like maybe there's a way that

209
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,240
uh we could uh relate to I know I certainly can relate to the story of the Buddha's Awakening where he had some

210
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:22,160
confusion he wasn't clear to him okay well how do I find greater Peace and Freedom he went to some meditation

211
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:28,960
Masters that didn't work you went to work with some Aesthetics that didn't work and it was until he had a memory

212
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:37,000
from something from childhood which for me kind of like represents some innocence some ease you know when we're

213
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,800
children we don't have as uh as much idea of who we're supposed to be instead

214
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,280
we're just with the moment maybe there's this way in which

215
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:54,000
stories um kind of connect us with some emotion in this case maybe there's

216
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:02,960
frustration or perseverance and but maybe also some peace but there's also a way in which uh

217
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:10,520
stories pass down Traditions sitting sitting in a meditation posture

218
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:18,319
for us we sit cross-legged I can imagine that there's other Traditions right that don't necessarily sit in this particular

219
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:24,000
way but there's a way that um we also are passing down some of these uh

220
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,680
beliefs and values get shared uh with this with the stories in this particular

221
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:40,599
story of the Buddha's Awakening this idea of that okay there are difficulties in life daa there are struggles and for

222
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:46,920
me this is also really meaningful just to recognize okay I'm not the only one who has had struggles and a certain

223
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,480
amount of relief to like oh yeah even thousands of years ago they were

224
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,920
struggling too they had difficulties the particulars were different but there's

225
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:05,160
something the same that all of us humans have and there's also this way in which

226
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:13,000
through this storytelling is this uh in the Buddhist tradition in particular this um this uh

227
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,240
emphasis on Behavior ethical behavior in this version of this of the

228
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:29,079
story that I told the budha is not doing anything unethical right he's following the precepts he's uh has a standard uh

229
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:34,520
for his behavior that he's not going around you know trying to harm other

230
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:40,240
people and convince them or he's not uh gossiping about people like oh I had to

231
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:47,280
leave those the meditation Masters they were so terrible you know there's nothing like that no he's just finding

232
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:54,720
his way there another way in which like stories help uh connect us through what

233
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,599
we hold valuable and shared and some of our shared

234
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:08,680
struggles even though it's not in the poly Canon which we hold up to be really high this exact version of the story

235
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:15,440
it's a version of the story that get Carries On from Drama teacher to D teacher and Dr practitioner to Dr

236
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,359
practitioner books and so many different ways movies because it's meaningful and

237
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:27,319
it connects us so the stories that connect us

238
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:33,200
connect us as humans maybe today you'll notice some of

239
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:40,079
the stories that connect you to this tradition to this practice and to other

240
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:47,039
people are some of the stories that you share and are they helpful or not

241
