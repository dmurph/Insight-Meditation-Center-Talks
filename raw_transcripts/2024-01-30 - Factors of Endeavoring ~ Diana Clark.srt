1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,720
so tonight I'd like to talk a little bit or share about a story that uh is in the

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:13,920
suit does and I think that uh at least for me and actually I know for a number of people that I've spoken with it's uh

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,800
has some important or meaningful or helpful uh messages in it or something

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,439
like this so so it's a a story about this person

5
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:32,160
named Prince bod who is a prince not surprisingly and uh the

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:40,960
Buddha and Prince bod he had um built a new building like they call

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,719
it a long house which I guess was not uncommon in that time in Ancient India it's just like it sounds a long building

8
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:53,079
in which people would stay and Prince bod named it the pink

9
00:00:53,079 --> 00:01:00,160
Lotus long house and I just had this thought like right as uh Jim was ringing the bell

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,640
pink Lotus long house thought if I ever open a restaurant you know it just kind of has like a nice sound to it

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:16,320
so I don't think I will ever be opening a restaurant but if I were so Prince bod had uh built this uh

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,640
Pink Lotus long house and he invited the Buddha and his

13
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,079
monastics to come and to to um have a meal

14
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:33,000
there and and the Buddha agreed and

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,280
so Prince bod at his own house has uh overseas and has all the food prepared

16
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,000
for the Buddha this is very common at this time that uh somebody would like

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,399
oversee the preparing like it's we don't know how many monastics but it could have been a lot so it might have been like a big deal to make all this

18
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,719
food so he makes his food and then um

19
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:06,039
he's Prince bod is waiting outside his house house uh when the Buddha and his monastics show up so Prince bod like

20
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:13,599
welcomes pays homage to the Buddha and says you know please like uh after you let's go to the pink Lotus long

21
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,800
house so the Buddha uh walks to the pink

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,519
Lotus long house and Prince bod and all the other monastics are behind them and I guess they're bringing the

23
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:31,640
food and um they get there it's not too far away and Prince had like put this

24
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,840
white cloth like we that went through the hole of the building and then down the front

25
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,120
steps maybe we could think like the red carpet treatment is kind of what I was

26
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:51,400
thinking and that Buddha walks up to it and he stops before he gets to this white

27
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,640
cloth and uh Prince Booty says Venable

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,720
sir please step on the white cloth so so that it may be for my welfare and

29
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,640
happiness for a long time and the Buddha just stands

30
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:15,239
there he doesn't step on the cloth he doesn't say anything he's just standing

31
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:22,640
there Prince bod a second time venerable sir please step on the white cloth so

32
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,360
that it may be for my welfare and happiness for a long time the Buddha still just standing

33
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,640
there he's a patient guy right so he's just standing there doesn't say anything he doesn't

34
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:44,040
step on the cloth and the third time Prince Boi says Venable sir please step on the white

35
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,680
cloth we don't know right this is a little my embellishment of the story of course but so that it may be for my

36
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,400
welfare and happiness for a long time so like Prince bod somehow is really invested in the Buddha stepping on this

37
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:04,799
white cloth and he we don't know exactly what Prince bod was thinking but he clearly has this idea that it would be

38
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,280
helpful if the Buddha would step on this

39
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,720
cloth for it would be for his welfare and happiness for a long time and

40
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,720
somehow I was kind of thinking about this you know it's not unusual sometimes we have this secret wish like oh if only

41
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,759
like something out there would shift and change and be different or somebody else

42
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:34,440
would do something then I would be happy then my life would go right you know kind of like waiting for somebody or

43
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,199
something else like out there in our external life to be

44
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,720
different kind of like in some ways expecting you know somebody else to make us happy and kind of like issuing the

45
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:52,919
responsibility we might have so Prince bod he's kind of like this so after the third time that he

46
00:04:52,919 --> 00:05:00,240
asks the Buddha looks over at Ananda Ananda is his assistant uh and his

47
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:08,000
cousin his attendant I should say he looks over at Ananda doesn't say anything just looks

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,720
over at Ananda and Ananda I give Ananda a lot of credit and what Ananda does he

49
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:24,199
says fold up the cloth Prince the Buddha will not step on the white cloth he has

50
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:29,600
compassion for future Generations so I like that Ananda

51
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,120
doesn't chastise Prince bod or doesn't say anything like that or doesn't say the Buddha like what why are you looking

52
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,039
at me what do you want me to do but instead like Ananda understood that okay

53
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:49,080
if the Buddha has been asked three times and he still doesn't do it it means he's just not going to do it and so he so

54
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,840
Ananda says well fold up the cloth the Buddha's not going to step on it and then he adds the Buddha has compassion

55
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:04,120
for future Generations Ananda understood what was happening that if Prince if the

56
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,199
Buddha had stepped on the cloth and Prince bodh said yay this is going to be for my happiness and Welfare for a long

57
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:17,000
time then that would kind of like undermine this idea of practice and people would think that oh

58
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,720
yeah just the way to have some happiness in your life is to get somebody else to do something for

59
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,919
you and it's also is a way that um kind of if in the future somebody were to

60
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:38,160
let's say if the Buddha had stepped on the cloth and Prince bod did have a great life what would happen if in the

61
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,240
future a monastic stepped on a white cloth and somebody didn't have happiness

62
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,120
afterwards that would like undermine the whole monastic Community undermine the whole idea of practice so this just

63
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,800
doesn't work this whole idea have just find a Buddha get him to

64
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:02,840
step on a cloth and you'll be fine turns out it doesn't work this way even if if you have the Good Fortune to meet a

65
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:10,960
Buddha so so then we getting back to the the

66
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:19,240
suta the prince says oh so the prince he had the cloth folded up and uh he prepared the seats

67
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:26,440
where all the monastics were going to sit and then um Prince bodh he offered a food by himself which is kind of a big

68
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:33,599
deal you know he's royalty and usually has servants doing these kind of things but he himself Prince bod offers food to

69
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,639
the monastics and they eat and then they have their fill then afterwards he has a

70
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,919
little conversation with the Buddha and he

71
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,680
says pleasure is only gained through

72
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,520
pain this is what Prince fod says to the Buddha pleasure is only gained through

73
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,879
pain you can only have something good if you suffer for it now it kind of like

74
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:10,120
makes sense why Prince bod wants the Buddha step on the cloth because Prince bod thinks to practice is going to be

75
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:17,319
painful in order to get to have a better life or have something that's uh pleasurable or find more freedom more

76
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:24,599
ease more peace you have to do something really painful so Prince bod is saying pleasure

77
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:31,719
is only gained through pain and so then uh the Buddha

78
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:37,599
responds well before my Awakening I also

79
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:45,120
thought that pleasure is only gained through pain and then in order to make the point

80
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:52,120
the Buddha gives a little bit of his autobiography why the Buddha himself before he was awakened kind of like

81
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:59,200
thought that okay pain is a part of practice a necessary part of practice many of you know this story

82
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,240
story of the Buddha's Awakening he leaves the palace that he was living in

83
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,240
and goes to practice he wants to find Freedom find peace and he practices with

84
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,120
some esteemed meditation Masters discovers some meditation how to

85
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,240
meditate but didn't find Peace and Freedom there so he went from one

86
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,360
teacher to a second teacher and then he said well maybe some austerities some

87
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,160
really intense austerities aestheticism is needed that's the way to

88
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:40,120
find Freedom and this is where the Buddha is saying yeah I used to think that pain was the way to

89
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,720
Freedom so he said um this the Buddha is telling this story

90
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,240
to Prince bod and he says they after he had left the teachers he said seeking

91
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,040
the state of supreme peace I set out to discover what is skillful what is

92
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,480
skillful so if this meditation isn't going to work what is and then the

93
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:10,040
Buddha says traveling I came to sanama in urua and there I saw this delightful

94
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:16,480
Grove a lovely piece of ground with a clear flowing river and pleasant smooth

95
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:25,160
Banks and nearby was a village for Ms so an ideal location to practice water food

96
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,959
it was a pleasant place then the Buddha speaking he said

97
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:38,000
so having found this lovely place I sat down and I thought this is a

98
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,399
good place for endeavoring for practicing striving working applying

99
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:51,440
myself and the Buddha says why don't I with teeth clenched and tongue pressed

100
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,040
against the roof of my mouth squeeze squash and Crush mind with

101
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,200
mind like a strong person would grab a weaker person by the head or throat and

102
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,760
squeeze squash squash or crush them so that's what I did until sweat

103
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:17,720
poured from my armpits this quite something right he's like really in there striving mind

104
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,079
crushing mind this idea like okay I don't know exactly what Awakening is for

105
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:29,639
how to get there but I'm going to force my mind to do something there's no details here exactly what that was

106
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:37,600
was but just like through force of will with his mind so then he says my energy was

107
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:47,399
roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and Lucid but my body was Disturbed and not

108
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,800
tranquil because I pushed too hard with that painful

109
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,959
striving so the Buddhist recognizing this Crush mind with mind doesn't

110
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:04,399
work and then the Buddha continues and then I thought well why don't I practice the

111
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,800
breathing less meditation to not breathe holding one's

112
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,880
breath so I cut off breathing through my mouth and nose but violent winds cut

113
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,320
through my head like a strong person was drilling into my head with a strong

114
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:30,920
point my energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and loose but my

115
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,959
body was Disturbed and not tranquil because I pushed too hard with

116
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,720
that painful striving so here's a second practice that the Buddha did it didn't

117
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,360
um he couldn't find Freedom that way and then he includes there's a few

118
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:57,040
more um aesthetic practices that he did and they all say well then it didn't work and it was quite painful and I

119
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,480
didn't become awakened and they all end with this my energy was

120
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,639
roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and Lucid so he had energy and he had

121
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:18,120
mindfulness but he was just exhausting himself so then he says after he

122
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:26,079
describes a number of aesthetic practices he had done he said whatever spiritual adapts have experienced those

123
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:33,600
painful sharp severe AC feelings due to overexertion no one has done more than

124
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,240
me so just saying I did everything that's humanly possible describing starving himself you know all these

125
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,399
kinds of things and then he says you know that he

126
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:50,680
had a different idea like okay clearly those meditation Masters didn't work

127
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,680
this aestheticism didn't work so there has to be a third way and many of you

128
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:03,320
will know this is kind of like the middle way between this uh asceticism and indulgences and this is like the

129
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:10,040
road of practice then he found the bod tree another Pleasant place to practice

130
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:17,440
eventually sits down and becomes awakened that's all kind of the story about how that

131
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:24,360
happens so the Buddha is telling the story to Prince bodh kind of say like you know look I really tried this

132
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,600
painful thing and it didn't lead to pleasure it led to this exhaustion and

133
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,480
due to my overexertion and straining and

134
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,480
striving and it wasn't until you know that Buddha went another way that's this

135
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,920
third way between the extremes of indulgence and austerities but the way

136
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:53,279
to practice um the way that the Buddha described it his own practice doesn't mean everybody has to do this but his

137
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:59,759
own practice included the janas these are meditative states that are quite pleasurable

138
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,920
so instead it was actually through pleasure that he found his way towards

139
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,079
Awakening so it's that pleasure is and happiness and joy these are intrical parts of

140
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:18,639
practice right many of you might know the seven factors of Awakening include happiness and joy and concentration

141
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:25,440
including the Jas doesn't have to be the Jas but often

142
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:33,319
is so then after he tells all this to uh Prince bod so then Prince bod says well

143
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:40,519
when a person has the Buddha as the teacher right because the Buddha did this without a teacher so he had to try

144
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:47,360
all these things and discover what didn't work so Prince bdy says oh well now that you know that it's works it's

145
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,839
got to be easier so Prince Buddha says when a person has a Buddha as the trainer how

146
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:59,480
long does it take to become awakened why we don't blame him for are asking this

147
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,440
question right I think all of us would ask these questions is it going to be hard and how long is it going to take I

148
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:14,600
think we ask us about so many things in our lives right is this am I going to do this how how hard is it going to be and

149
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,319
what is it going to take and the Buddha replies with a

150
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:25,800
question to the prince instead of saying right away he asks the prince a

151
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:32,360
question Prince Booty are are you skilled in the art of wielding a hooked

152
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,800
go while riding an elephant I don't know exactly what a hooked goat is but it's

153
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,920
something that one does when they're writing an elephant Prince Bo here's a skill that

154
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,720
you have or do you have this particular skill and Prince boy says yes I am

155
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,759
skilled in that so the Buddha asks him some

156
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:02,360
questions well suppose a person were to come to you Prince bod and asked you to

157
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,360
train them in working with an elephant with a hooked

158
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:14,079
good if that person did not have any

159
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:23,480
confidence could they achieve what could be achieved if they did have confidence no well are you like can am I

160
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,120
saying that the negative right if they didn't have any confidence you can't achieve what you could achieve if you

161
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:36,039
did have confidence kind of makes sense right and then the Buddha says if that

162
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:41,799
person had no Vitality could they achieve what a

163
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:51,080
person who had Vitality could achieve no if that person were dishonest and had

164
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,600
no Integrity could they achieve what an

165
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:02,640
honest person with and integrity could achieve

166
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,159
no if a person had energy did not have energy could they

167
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:16,559
achieve what a person with energy could achieve no if that person were unwise could they

168
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,600
achieve what a person with wisdom could achieve

169
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,320
no so the Buddha is outlining five qualities here

170
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,559
and SP is saying you know wow if they

171
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:38,799
had if that person had even one of those qualities they could train under me like

172
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:45,039
one of those five if they had confidence

173
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:51,720
Vitality Integrity energy and wisdom they could

174
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,080
practice under they could learn from a prince bodh and then the Buddha says

175
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:04,679
well these are these five five factors of endeavoring is is a list in the Buddha

176
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:10,919
teachings that we don't talk about as much but I think it's such an interesting list because this is a

177
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:19,159
common question like how much effort to apply and what does effort look like and

178
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:24,880
is that the only thing that's needed because sometimes when we get stuck we feel like okay I just have to push

179
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:32,520
harder I just have to do the same thing but more I've did a lot of that in my early

180
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:39,520
practice and I tried to crush mind with mind I didn't know that expression but I somehow thought that I had to make my

181
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,840
mind be a certain way and there was this tension and I would like meditate with like this you know this kind of a thing

182
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,640
you know just really trying to strain and strive it didn't

183
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:59,400
work it didn't work for me I one of the time s when I

184
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:07,880
um really started to feel like there's some movement some real movement in my meditation practice was this time when

185
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:14,400
um I had some uh physical difficulties and so I had to lay down I

186
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,200
couldn't meditate sitting up that was quite something because you

187
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:29,039
can't strain it's hard to strain as much like when you're lying down and uh I just realized oh

188
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:37,440
this is a whole different way to practice with still with this commitment to practice with some diligence and some

189
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:45,400
sincerity but without the tightness and the straining I just felt kind of like a a

190
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:52,480
certain like a deepening and a letting go and a settling that started to point the way like oh this is the direction to

191
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,120
go not this real straining and striving that I had been doing and to be sure the

192
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:06,360
teachers had been telling me Dan you know back off you're a little too tight and I was like what do they

193
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:12,120
know you know like this worked for everything else in my life if you just have to work really hard because it's

194
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,840
true right for some things in our life working hard really does is the right

195
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,320
way the get through school sometimes it's a lot of work to have difficult

196
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:31,440
conversations with people so that you can like really allow your relationship to grow and mature it's a lot of

197
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,120
work sometimes jobs are a lot of work to work with difficult people or maybe

198
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,919
they're taxing in all kinds of different ways deadlines so this idea of kind of like

199
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:52,480
pushing is familiar to us because it works in so many areas of Our Lives it doesn't work the same way in

200
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,000
meditation we need a certain amount of effort

201
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
but itely goes as far as it goes I mean it'll work until it doesn't kind of

202
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,200
thing so I'd like to unpack a little bit this five factors of endeavoring five

203
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:21,200
factors of applying oneself five factors of working five factors of

204
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,960
um I'll just maybe say endeavoring is kind of an odd word endeavoring

205
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:34,799
working but something to for anything you want to do and pra this is being applied to

206
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:43,960
practice but anything you want to do confidence Vitality Integrity energy

207
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,320
wisdom confidence it makes a difference whether

208
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:55,240
you think the task you're embarking on is even

209
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,200
possible I don't think that I can fly I am not practicing flying right I just

210
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,960
because I just don't think that it's possible so you have to have a certain

211
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:14,080
confidence that it is possible maybe even this goes without saying but sometimes it can be

212
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,960
worthwhile to you know investigate like do we have confidence that a it's

213
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,000
possible to find greater peace ease

214
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,919
Freedom happiness well-being do we think that's possible for

215
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:37,240
us in this lifetime and do we think that we have

216
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:44,640
the capabilities you do have the capabilities if you're sitting in this room you have the capabilities and I'll

217
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,840
I'll go over that a little bit more here but just so confidence right just to

218
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:58,840
it's kind of like sometimes goes without saying but a certain amount of confidence is needed and it's not an

219
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:04,760
accident that this is the first item in the list right we have to kind of believe

220
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,760
yeah this is possible and humans can do it and

221
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:20,840
um and I can do it and so the Buddha um he also says

222
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:28,080
this whole idea of confidence I'm I'm sorry I missed over a part but

223
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:36,600
that's okay so this um also gets this word s in ply

224
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Dharma teacher Paulie would say Sada but if you're yeah paully is Sada and it often

225
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,600
gets translated as conviction so like just yes this is possible or

226
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,279
faith but often when we hear the word faith many of us think about uh this

227
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:03,279
unverified belief you you know just beliefs you have to adopt and that's not what's being pointed to here it's the

228
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:09,640
faith that greater peace freedom and ease is possible maybe you haven't experienced

229
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:16,559
it yet but this idea that more is possible that's what's being pointed to here is

230
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:25,440
Faith and then Vitality this sense of just like having

231
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:32,880
some uh enough maybe like energy or Consciousness or

232
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,360
awakeness and it can be just enough Vitality to just hear a Dharma

233
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,520
talk maybe it's not even like coming to a place driving to IMC but maybe there's

234
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:51,840
even people on YouTube who are lying down in bed listening because they're ill and that's

235
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,760
all they can do and that's all that's needed it's just this Vitality just in

236
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,120
enough to be able to like just be aware of what's Happening there's a suta where the

237
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,720
Buddha is sick and he is laying down he's very

238
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,559
sick and somebody comes to him and chants and the Seven factors of

239
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:20,640
Awakening to him and this is what was kind of like needed for the buddas to

240
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,720
maybe have some more energy and maybe that was all that at that time when he

241
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:32,159
was really sick he was capable of so the sense of Vitality it's not asking

242
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:39,600
a lot from us but maybe this um idea of being able

243
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,480
to take in some information and process it sometimes when we're in extreme pain

244
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:51,080
we can't do that or you we can't do that so maybe Vitality is also pointing to a

245
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,600
certain amount of a wherewith all

246
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:04,799
Maybe but I would also say that a c enough Vitality also to understand okay some

247
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:13,200
things are supportive for my practice and some things are not supportive I think all of us when we've

248
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:21,039
been injured or sick we all have noticed that if we get riled up and filled with

249
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:29,000
hatred and rage towards the sickness or the injury or someone else or some

250
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,279
institution or just getting filled with hatred and rage does not in the long run make us

251
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:43,640
feel better any pain that we have does not go away it just becomes more

252
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:51,159
acute instead it's when we can open and relax as best we can and whatever way is

253
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:57,120
available to us at that time as opposed to just you know being filled with Rage

254
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,279
or hate hatred so the Vitality is being pointed to is to recognize this just to know

255
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:11,000
this oh yeah when I hate that this is happening to me makes it a lot

256
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,640
worse if I'm able to say okay this is what my life is like at this

257
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,840
moment to turn be able to turn towards it as best we can as best we

258
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:31,120
can then it's better so the typ of Vitality point to to recognize that it doesn't mean that

259
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,240
you can stop the hatred and rage you know right then this is a natural reaction a lot of humans have this of

260
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:43,799
course when we have injuries we're really sickness or we're really

261
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,039
sick so I want to be careful here

262
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:58,480
because sometimes this uh this poly word is um

263
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:06,559
gets well I guess literally it's a a gets translated as a little like

264
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:14,440
oppression like there's little of anything that's holding you down so it's not you're not being held down too

265
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:21,120
much and um a Tano it's also kind of like the sickness isn't too much that's

266
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:29,480
uh with these words that I'm translating as Vitality sometimes people use this word

267
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:36,279
health and then you start to get this feeling like but I'm I'm not

268
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:41,720
healthy because the Dharma world is filled with people who found their way

269
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:48,720
to the Dharma because of sickness because of illness and I can imagine it would be

270
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,320
demoralizing to hear like wait I have to be healthy but I I'm not so it's more

271
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:00,080
about Vitality just having this a certain enough kind of energy

272
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,279
there so confidence vitality and then Integrity is the third

273
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:13,519
one and this is related to not being deceitful not being

274
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:21,480
fraudulent um not being devious but instead to be forthright to be open to

275
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,559
be honest to be authentic that's also what's being asked

276
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:33,600
as part of this to this uh quality of endeavoring and um in the sutas it

277
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,240
points to in particular to be open and honest with

278
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,640
one's teachers or companions in the spiritual life it's kind of the language

279
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,399
that's used so there's a way in which we might want people to think the best of

280
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:58,279
us I know when I was practicing I kind of wanted the teachers to like me and think I was a good student

281
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:03,399
and so you know I was reluctant to show them all the ways that I was

282
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:09,480
struggling and that's normal right I think all humans we do this often we

283
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:16,679
want to kind of like give our best impression but this is pointing to like

284
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:23,360
you can do this you can tell the things that are going well but in order for people to really be able to support you

285
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,000
they need to know where you really are struggling and in order to know where you're struggling there needs to be some

286
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,519
authenticity and some honesty doesn't mean that you have to tell everybody all

287
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:40,120
the time and be worn on your sleeve but people on the path with you or your

288
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,840
teacher to be able to say you know this is what's going on and

289
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,360
I would say it's most helpful to say kind of like what's going well and where the struggles

290
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:59,840
are a full picture like this forthrightness this honesty and this

291
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:08,519
openness so that's the third quality is integrity the fourth one is

292
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,240
energy so the energy is this the energy here is the one that's related to right

293
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:22,679
effort on the eight-fold path if you're familiar with the eight-fold path and this points to the energy to

294
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:30,120
not only recognize that for example feel hatred or rage towards not feeling

295
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:37,120
well um isn't helpful or that uh to recognize that

296
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:44,120
having a little bit more ease or openness towards what's actually happening in the moment is helpful the

297
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:50,919
energy is pointing to having the having the intention kind of like

298
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:57,760
this okay I want to turn away from the hatred and rage that is AE habit and I

299
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:04,559
find myself falling into and getting overwhelmed with I want to see if I can turn away for

300
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,519
example so that takes energy to even set that intention okay I can see this isn't

301
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:16,279
helping me is there another way and that this the energy is pointing to that

302
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:23,000
cultivating what is helpful and letting go what isn't helpful this is what the

303
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,720
energy is about and for some people it's just to be able to recog in initially it's just to be able to

304
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,919
recognize okay I can't help myself but I know this isn't the way that's

305
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:41,039
helpful and to set the intention to be able to go another way that is helpful

306
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,519
so the energy is about this and then the last one is

307
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:52,760
wisdom and the wisdom is pointed to here in a particular way it's defined in a particular

308
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:59,679
way it's about recognizing that experiences arise and pass

309
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:06,120
away they come and they go They're impermanent they are

310
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:11,839
inconstant they are not steady everything all of our experiences

311
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:18,638
arise and pass away and having this like seeing this

312
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:27,158
having this wisdom like really understanding this does a number of things including it helps us to put our

313
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:33,200
priorities in order like okay things aren't going to last forever nothing lasts

314
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,118
forever doesn't mean that uh this particular ailment I have I'm really

315
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:46,040
focusing on sickness here but this works for people who are healthy as well doesn't mean that this is going to go

316
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:54,320
away it doesn't mean it's not going away it means that maybe it fluctuates in its intensity This Love that I feel for

317
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,359
somebody doesn't mean it's necessarily going to go away but but it's going to change it's going to have seasons of

318
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:05,240
course it is just like everything so recognizing that helps us

319
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:11,839
to put things into priority maybe we're not going to live

320
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:17,880
for maybe recognizing that we're not going to live forever helps us to say

321
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:23,000
okay this is what's important and maybe it's not so important to prove to others

322
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,800
that I'm right all the time or to correct them when they do things wrong or something like

323
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:35,480
that so there's a way this impermanence help might help us put our priorities

324
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:41,760
kind of shift our priorities when we recognize we're not going to live forever and what we're experiencing is

325
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,160
not going to last always it's going to wax and Wayne and maybe disappear we

326
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:53,200
don't know impermanence also of course um

327
00:35:53,200 --> 00:36:00,400
helps us to recognize this is where growth and development cultivation is another

328
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,400
way of saying impermanence means things are changing so there's a way that we can

329
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,000
say oh yeah just like this is changing this uh this this uncomfortable feeling

330
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,400
in my knee in the same way my ability to sit

331
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:24,800
still for however long is changing too so impermanence also right is this

332
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:32,079
idea that things grow and develop and maybe a third thing that I'll just say about impermanence here is it just

333
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:39,480
doesn't make sense to hold on to things that are changing that are in constant and are

334
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:46,560
going away coming and leaving so there's just naturally a certain amount of Letting Go that

335
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,240
happens so I believe this is why wisdom is like the fifth element in these five

336
00:36:52,240 --> 00:37:00,079
factors of endeavoring confidence Vitality

337
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:07,599
Integrity wisdom I'm sorry uh energy and wisdom so then after the Buddha gives

338
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:14,240
this talk to Prince bod remember he asked well how long how long is it going to take to become awakened and the

339
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:21,440
Buddha answers him he says he says I have to get back to this

340
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,420
so I can like quote uh here

341
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:33,760
[Applause] he says oh my goodness

342
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,400
um I have to go back number Pages here

343
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:48,359
um so the after the Buddha he had gave uh Prince bod these confidence Vitality

344
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:54,800
Integrity energy and wisdom these uh five endeavoring and then he says if a

345
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,720
person has these five factors of endeavoring they can realize the Supreme

346
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:07,520
end of this spiritual path in seven years but let alone seven years they

347
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,640
could realize the Supreme end of the spiritual path in six

348
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,560
years well let alone six years if you have these you can do it in five years

349
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,760
let alone five years if you have these five factors you can do it in four years

350
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:31,079
let alone four years you can do this three years two 2 years one year let alone one year 7

351
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:39,240
months let alone 7 months 6 months five months four months the

352
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:47,160
Buddha just keep on going down right two months one month seven days you know where this is

353
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:52,200
going right six days one let alone six

354
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:58,800
days one can realize the Supreme end of the spiritual path in five days let

355
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,440
alone 5 days 4 days 3 days two

356
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,760
days and then he says let alone one

357
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:19,720
day one can be instructed in the morning and Achieve Awakening by the

358
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:27,280
evening and prince the prince bod is delighted and he says oh oh Buddha oh

359
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,599
the teachings how well this explains the teachings that one can be instructed in

360
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:38,720
the morning and Achieve Awakening in the evening and then someone that's standing

361
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,960
near Prince bod says to him yeah though you speak like this Prince B you don't

362
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,720
go for refuge in the Buddha dharm s right he's not taking the Buddha as his

363
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:57,720
teacher and then Prince bod says oh don't say that I've heard I've

364
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:04,720
heard and learned the teachings in the presence of my mother when she was pregnant with me she took refuge in the

365
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:11,000
Buddha Dharma and SAA and then when I was really young and I had a wet nurse

366
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,760
They Carried me to the um where the Buddha was and the wet nurse took refuge

367
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:23,160
in the Buddha Dharma and sa and then I can imagine everybody's going that doesn't

368
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:31,119
count then Prince bod he finally says I take refuge in the Buddha Dharma and

369
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,960
SAA so this is a story of somebody who's trying to figure out like how much work

370
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,200
do I need to do like how long is it going to take how much work needs to be done and I think the Buddha he's

371
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:50,720
pointing to it's not just about straining and striving because he tried that it didn't work instead to think

372
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:59,560
about this confidence or Vitality or Integrity maybe these are some things for us to think about do we have

373
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:07,000
confidence that we can have some more happiness health well-being and Peace

374
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:15,520
and Freedom and if not is there something that we might do are we being open and honest with

375
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:22,319
those people that are that could help us and support us in this practice sharing our struggles as well as what's doing

376
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:28,800
well and I would say sometimes we have friends that we just struggle with We complain about how hard it is maybe

377
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,800
being forthright and is to say you know these things are going

378
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,160
well and then having the energy to say you know I want to cultivate what's uh

379
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,760
helpful and skillful and then the wisdom to recognize yeah things change they're

380
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,680
always changing and this is how one can find

381
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:58,240
the way towards Awakening to Greater peace freedom and ease

382
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:05,200
so Prince bodh and maybe I'll say for those of you who don't know Bodi means Awakening this for me has been a real

383
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:11,560
head scratcher why is he called Prince Awakening when he's the one who doesn't really want

384
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:17,119
to practice so I don't know this might be something to maybe there's a secret

385
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,440
meaning there that I don't know but so thank you thank you for your

386
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:30,119
attention and I'd like to open it up to some questions and

387
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,839
