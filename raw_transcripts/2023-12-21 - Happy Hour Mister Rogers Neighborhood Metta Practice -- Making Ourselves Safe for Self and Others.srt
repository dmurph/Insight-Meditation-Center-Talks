1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,840
so hello and welcome everyone to happy hour so for today I want to um share a

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:15,759
little teaching that um I was inspired to to learn from my dear beloved friend

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,279
and teacher Sylvia bin um and

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,599
um this teaching is about um making your

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,320
minds and hearts safe for yourself and others the same way that it's it's as if

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:42,440
it were Mr Rogers Neighborhood Mr Rogers neighborhood so um anyone not familiar

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,079
with Mr Rogers Neighborhood raise your hand I'm looking at my other iPad I'm not seeing any oh yeah one person oh

8
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:55,879
great okay so there's one person who's not familiar okay great I'll tell you I'll tell you about Mr Rogers so um it's

9
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:03,000
um and and I became actually familiar with Mr Rogers after I moved to the US um as well when I was 16 years

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,240
old later than that but anyway so so Mr Rogers was uh or Fred Rogers was a

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,560
pastor who was um responsible who who actually did uh children's programming

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:24,960
and and he was such a kind kind beautiful being uh through and through

13
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,000
it wasn't just a performance he was a beautiful kind being he he taught meta

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,240
and compassion to children of all ages um and actually his programming was

15
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:47,479
really Progressive for his time in so many ways there's so many Beautiful Stories so if if uh anyone does not know

16
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:55,200
about uh him I do highly recommend you look up Mr Rogers later and and read a

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,840
little bit about him so one thing that he would always say begin his

18
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,159
show with was it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood it's a beautiful day in

19
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,360
the neighborhood um and and um and then what

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,599
we he say won't you be my won't you be my won't you be my neighbor so and then

21
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:25,200
I think he would begin and end the show that way so so was Mr Rogers Neighborhood there a lot of cets a lot

22
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,440
of characters and really basically he taught meta compassion wisdom by any

23
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:37,640
name just um so so Sylvia um using this as a

24
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,560
metaphor in her teaching to make our hearts and Minds like Mr Roger's

25
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,519
Neighborhood safe safe for everyone for all these characters for all these

26
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,640
beings for all these little puppets that that show up in our minds and hearts can

27
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,680
we make it a safe neighborhood both for ourselves and for others so

28
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,040
so um yeah and there's Al so much more to say about Mr rogers's neighborhood

29
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:14,360
which I think I'll just leave it at that I think most of you are already familiar much better than I am with Mr Roger's

30
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,319
neighborhood so much more so I'll just leave it up to you to to feel into your

31
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,400
own associations affiliations with with u yeah what that means what that means

32
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:35,920
for you um and if you're new to it again and think of a a loving a a a batva

33
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,239
teacher who's just who a Buddha likee n teacher who's made the safe neighborhood

34
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,519
with lots of teachings on kindness compassion internally and externally so

35
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,840
so with that let's sit together let's sit

36
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,680
together arriving arriving in our bodies

37
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,480
with awareness with

38
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:32,160
kindness and how can we offer kindness to [Music]

39
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:40,100
ourselves can we make this neighborhood that is our heart and mind safe for [Music]

40
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,800
ourselves and we make it even a little safer than it already

41
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,319
is a little less self judgment a little

42
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,660
less [Music]

43
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,840
criticism a little more friendliness with each

44
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
breath

45
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,280
and what if this body this mind this

46
00:06:51,520 --> 00:07:01,720
heart was feeling [Music] held in safety and Care friendliness as

47
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:11,080
if held in the friendliness of Mr Roger's

48
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,759
neighborhood for those who have an association

49
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:39,520
with Mr Rogers and his kindness and his compassion and

50
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:52,199
his his guests the various characters

51
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,360
puppets and we imagine characters in our mind as these

52
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,280
these puppets we get to offer safety and

53
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,800
kindness

54
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:19,639
to we get to be friend we get to befriend all aspects of

55
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,240
ourselves treat them with dignity with kindness with respect

56
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,480
ECT and know that in some ways they are made up they are puppets and yet and

57
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:06,000
yet it's how we cultivate our Goodwill and kindness It's how we train

58
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,040
ourselves in

59
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:26,440
goodwi maybe even you softly hear as a

60
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:33,560
metagen it's a beautiful day the neighborhood a beautiful day in the

61
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:48,200
neighborhood asking all aspects these puppets these aspects of

62
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,279
yourself won't you be your

63
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,839
neighbor we don't have to get rid of them

64
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,360
squash them get to know them with friendliness

65
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,279
kindness you're here for a

66
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
reason

67
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:11,040
and now what if we made ourselves safe for

68
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,519
others made our hearts our minds and our bodies Our physical

69
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:22,600
actions words thoughts say for

70
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,839
others expanding your good will

71
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:37,000
to others offering Mr rogers's neighborhood

72
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,160
to others to everyone we interact

73
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:50,480
with won't you be won't you be won't you be my

74
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
neighbor

75
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,320
radiating the kindness of Mr

76
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:13,279
Rogers

77
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:26,040
SP making ourself safe through kindness and

78
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Goodwill

79
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:13,759
then see what is needed whether more internal offering of safety is needed

80
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,199
more external or maybe both internal external no

81
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,800
separation offering ourselves and others safety and

82
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,320
friendliness all the characters all the little madeup

83
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,320
puppets internally and all the characters

84
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,399
externally all this impermanent arising and passing away

85
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,440
everyone worthy of friendliness and

86
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
kindness

87
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:59,679
as we turn to bring this meditation to a close

88
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,720
remember remember to be kind as everyone we

89
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:13,320
meet whether or not we see we know we appreciate everyone we meet is

90
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:19,760
fighting a difficult battle with challenges this life is challenging for

91
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:27,399
every single one of us in different ways so be kind be kind to yourself be kind

92
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:32,520
to Others May all beings

93
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:38,520
everywhere make themselves safe for themselves and for each

94
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:47,080
other may we all make ourselves safe for one another May there be peace in the

95
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,480
world thank you all thank you so much for your

96
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:09,440
practice I was having a fun time with Mr Rogers so tonight I would like to not

97
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,679
offer um small groups because I'm a bit under the

98
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:22,159
weather and I just wanted to offer a uh um an opportunity maybe for just a

99
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,279
couple of Reflections um that we can take either

100
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:34,640
um through your voice or or you can type them in chat either to me privately or

101
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:42,080
to everyone CH changing the settings now and uh maybe we'll end there so that I

102
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,120
will be kind to myself and offer myself some time to rest

103
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,480
so so any Reflections you like to share or questions about

104
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,279
this Mr Rogers Neighborhood practice

105
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:05,679
and if anyone by the way hasn't seen the movie um that came out a few years ago

106
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:14,679
um it's I forget what the name of it is I'm sure somebody will type it in chat it's a really a it's a a great depiction

107
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:20,559
of of this amazing character this amazing being so any

108
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:26,440

not feeling well um I hope it doesn't spoil the the weekend for you um but I

112
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,080
was immediately reminded I I had the wonderful opportunity of going to a very

113
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,960
very famous therapist he start he founded the school of cognitive therapy

114
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:07,240
and he was aging when I went to him but he would sit in with groups and you know

115
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,440
people were talking about things that were bothering them and every so often

116
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:20,279
somebody would sort of beat themselves up for you know not doing things better and his his response almost invariably

117
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:28,240
was yes we're all up Val human beings but it he put himself in our is a

118
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,679
total equal to us you know there was nothing special about him he loved us

119
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,919
just as much as we loved him um and it and it showed you know he really cared

120
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:46,159
about everybody in the group and so your description of I always you know I'm a

121

humming along and singing which I did during the meditation it was very um I

135
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:23,120
I'm reminded of chance and things but the engagement of that part of the system and it was all very warm and U

136
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:31,320
very sweet and I started to think about everyone in the neighborhood it's very simple and uh not complicated and it was lovely

141
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:06,880
I also remember there's a scene in the movie that shows him that um while he was swimming in the pool um he was a

142
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:13,960
swimmer Mr Rogers and he would pray for everyone he would think of the names of

143
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,000
everyone and just wish them well wish them well wish them well and it's just

144
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:27,480
