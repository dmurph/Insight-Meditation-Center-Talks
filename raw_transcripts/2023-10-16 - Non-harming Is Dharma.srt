1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,840
so I'm going to tell you a tale about a monk and

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:15,879
um and I want to dedicate the tale to a wonderful monk that I met many years ago

3
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:21,960
named Yanda and uh he was the the the monk

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,039
responsible for the Burmese temple in back then back in Daily City eventually

5
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:36,680
he moved down and built the temple that's now now in um just south of Half Moon Bay and back then um uh the so the

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,079
so-called Temple was just a small house in Daily City kind a regular looking house in Daily City

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,840
and and um and when I was going to um go

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,640
to practice in Burma I heard about this Monk and so I went to to um I called him

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,039
up and said can I come visit you and he said sure so I think I took some bus and

10
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:09,799
walked some way into the neighborhood into the neighborhood and I knocked on the door the and he he answered the door

11
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:16,200
and the remarkable thing about how he received me I immediately felt like I'd

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,720
been his friend for decades like we were like he was like we were like old friend

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,320
old friends was the best way I could describe how he received me he never met me and he brought me in and we sat and

14
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,479
talked and it was the the kindness and warmth and friendship and friendliness that he

15
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:42,520
offered was kind of outstanding given that We Were Strangers so the tale is dedicated to

16
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:50,119
yil andand and hopefully he will proove so there was this monk Buddhist

17
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:56,079
monk who was traveling around and he came to a town where um there never been

18
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:03,399
any Buddhists there before people kind of hardly knew what Buddhism Buddhism was and he stayed there for some for

19
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:09,239
some while some days and and the people in the town kind of liked him and he

20
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,560
seemed to be remarkably calm and peaceful and U people felt really safe

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,560
with him and so actually some people started telling them telling him their life story what was going on with him

22
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,879
their challenges and it was just so nice and he didn't seem to have a lot to tell

23
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:30,920
them but they left those encounters with him kind of changed just because he was

24
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,519
so so friendly and kind and receptive to

25
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,959
what they had to say so that was nice and uh so then a

26
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:48,560
local professor of religion heard about the Monk and I was interested in Buddhism what is this Buddhism never met

27
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:56,680
the Buddhist before and so there was a chance maybe to learn something about Buddhism so she came to visit him and

28
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,800
um and uh you know she wanted to find out not what Buddhism is so she asked

29
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:09,879
maybe for her what seemed like the obvious questions she asked him what do you

30
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:21,000
believe and he answered long ago I believed but now I

31
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,000
act she was a little confused by this answer doesn't all religions have

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,959
beliefs and could he just have told her so she asked again a different way

33
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:41,760
what teachings do you rely on long ago I relied on

34
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,159
teachings now I rely on what I

35
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:55,480
know what but of course he was a Buddhist monk right so she try

36
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,120
again aren't you devoted to the Buddha because the follower of the Buddha right

37
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,640
aren't you devoted to the Buddha long

38
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:16,479
ago I was devoted to the Buddha but now I am devoted to

39
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,639
non-harming but what do you have faith in she said

40
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:30,680
us trying again all the ways in which he understood what religion is what do you have faith in

41
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:40,600
I don't have faith I have confidence in nonharming

42
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,720
action but but what is your ultimate

43
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,000
truth the end of doing harm ended doing any harm to myself or

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,080
to others but but

45
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,520
but this is nothing like religion in her mind but then you are left with no

46
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,639
desire for Good Life Hereafter many religions that's an important part of their religion but

47
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:21,759
then are you left with no desire for a good life Hereafter I have no

48
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,720
desire for a life Hereafter I desire a good life now the

49
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,120
rest will take care of itself but but

50
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,720
but what is the good life now a life lived without any deliberate

51
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,479
Act of body speech or mind that harm self or

52
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,520
others but then she had heard you know in Buddhism you're not supposed to have any desires so she thought she would ask

53
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,880
you know finally ask kind of a Buddhist question she did she was so confused by this time

54
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,080
do you have no desires

55
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:13,880
no I I desire a world committed to

56
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,400
non-harming and he answered her questions so kindly and calmly

57
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,680
and without any sense that she was wrong or any hostility

58
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,520
or she didn't she was left confused didn't fit any of her ideas of what

59
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:39,240
religion is but she left transformed in some way

60
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,400
changed so I offer that tale as a way of

61
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,360
suggesting that Buddhism has a radically different orientation than what most people think

62
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:59,400
about as religion and that this idea of non-harming lays at the center of what

63
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,520
what Buddhism is and maybe as an the ultimate goal to

64
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:11,319
non-harm and some people will feel that's not good enough because religions have ultimate truths ultimate purposes

65
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,440
ultimate goals ultimate experiences of Enlightenment it wouldn't that be nice to be

66
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:23,000
enlightened what is Enlightenment so transformed so fully

67
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,160
transformed that a person will have no deliberate attempts to harm anyone in

68
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:35,280
the world including themselves that's what enlightenment is but we don't usually say that because I

69
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,599
don't think you get so much people don't get so excited by

70
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:49,400
non-harming you know even if you said you know the ultimate goal is to realize the truth oh that gets that seems pretty

71
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:57,919
good you know or the ultimate the ultimate Enlightenment is to you know realize the highest possible

72
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:04,400
human realization of of Liberation you know then I get liberated

73
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,479
that's really great isn't it don't you want to be liberated so that's exciting

74
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,680
but to realize nonharming that is a

75
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,080
transformation it is a Liberation it's a Liberation for doing anything at all

76
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,280
that causes harm but but but that's not about

77
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,120
me isn't Enlightenment about something for me well you you you stop causing

78
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:39,399
harm to yourself isn't that pretty good you know I don't harm myself that

79
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,479
much I just

80
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:55,440
suffer so then the monk would say well in that case you should look more deeply see

81
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,720
what you're doing because the Cor four teachings of Buddhism it's often called the four

82
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,079
noble truths uh doesn't have the word harm in it it has the word duka which is

83
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:12,120
usually translated to English as suffering it literally means

84
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:19,000
pain but um the causes of that suffering the causes of that pain our activities

85
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,839
that what we're focusing on is not what the world does to us but what we do to

86
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,279
ourselves so if the world does something unfortunate to us that's unfortunate and

87
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:35,720
that we have to do our best to figure out what to do but if because of that we

88
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,160
now want to hate and because that we want to now harm others because of

89
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:48,040
that in that momentum we're harming ourselves hate always harms the

90
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,240
hater violence intentional violence always harms the one who is violent it

91
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:59,680
can't not because but they're not often we're not paying attention that way so that's why study yourself see what's

92
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,440
going on deeply and if you go really deep you also see that the suffering that we can

93
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,519
have some role in changing and transforming is the ones that arise from our own

94
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:18,320
attachments to cling is to harm ourselves and it's not necessarily an

95
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,079
ethical thing like so often we think of harming others as being unethical but to

96
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,120
um but uh you know being attached is not you know it's not an ethical issue but

97
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,680
but it is a issue of whether you are happy or whether you suffer and there's

98
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:41,000
a way in which attachment is there uh is the root way in which we harm ourselves

99
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,240
and chances are it's the root for why we harm others and so uh so but at the heart

100
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,519
what i is the Dharma is this non-harming Instinct this movement towards

101
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,800
this but is it ultimate shouldn't religion be about ultimate thing

102
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,320
things that uh you know that you can't really know for yourself but you take it

103
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:12,760
on faith because it comes from your Scriptures it comes from the Buddha it comes from your teachers you now I know

104
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:19,720
what's ultimate people involved in religion like ultimate things and uh and partly it's because

105
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,959
people religious people tend to put a lot of themselves into the religious

106
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:31,920
life that there's a kind of a commitment to something that's maybe bigger than themselves or something other and for

107
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:40,040
that level of a commitment people really want to know that it's this is really the best this is really good this is

108
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:47,440
Ultimate in the earliest teachings of the Buddha uh he he he he explicitly was not

109
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,560
interested in having ultimate truths so that and now this professor is

110
00:11:52,560 --> 00:12:00,959
can even more confused um that that the pursuit of ultimate truth was a detour

111
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:10,279
what the task was he said was to let go of clinging let go of craving let go of

112
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:17,959
attachments and uh to have ultimate truths for some people is just another attachment it's another detour it's a

113
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:23,079
distraction from doing this deep work but that's not you know just letting go

114
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:30,959
of my attachments I mean that's kind of like isn't that kind of like a small thing isn't that like that's not so how

115
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:37,079
can that be so great and wonderful and ultimate and I don't get a lot of credit among my

116
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:43,040
religious friends when I tell them what well our ultimate is just letting go of

117
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:50,480
clinging that doesn't seem very good so so I think the best thing to do

118
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,040
is to grant them that that is not that good it's not that

119
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:03,519
ultimate and uh and however it's that it might not be ultimate might

120
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,399
be the greatest thing you can do with your life

121
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,639
however it's the fundamental thing we should do in our life it's the beginning

122
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:23,440
of what we should do in our life we should um uh at least live a life of

123
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,839
non-harming at least find a way not to cause harm to oursel and others

124
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,440
at least do that important work our world will be transformed if we did that

125
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,720
we might we'll be transformed if we do that and once we learn once we discover

126
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:48,360
how to live without causing harm to self and other once we learn to live without

127
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,680
clinging and craving once we have that level of

128
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,839
Liberation well then if you're still interested in Ultimate truths

129
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,279
help yourself please that's good and maybe

130
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:11,040
you have some wonderful ones that are inspiring and wonderful and poetic and

131
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:18,519
and uh fun to read about and listen to and and be amazed by yes but let's do

132
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:25,199
this first thing and uh and what not a few Buddhists have discovered that doing the

133
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,839
Deep work the inner work uh of becoming free in this

134
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:37,560
way is pretty ultimate pretty fantastic the level of Peace the level of

135
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:44,199
well-being the well level of of safety that that provides is

136
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:49,920
astounding and uh and on the way to there there starts to be becoming an

137
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:57,920
appreciation of how difficult and deep this at work is it's a task of a lifetime to really

138
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,560
settle and find and come to what I would like to suggest that I like to believe

139
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,600
is a you know a really good fundamental place for all of us to be all of us to

140
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,800
begin begin everything from the Buddha said that if you cling

141
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,279
and you crave you can't really see what's really

142
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,720
true and so if you're in a religion and you're craving and clinging as part of

143
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,639
it it might obscure your ability to really understand even what your religion is talking

144
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,360
about and um and some people will say that uh once we once and there's not

145
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,839
Buddhism not the only religion that talks about non- clinging non-attachment and um and a lot of the

146
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:50,800
mystics in Rel in religions of all kinds um the beautiful teachings by a

147
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:57,040
Catholic Mystic named uh Mr Master E eart is that his name who uh talked

148
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:04,920
explicitly about the value of non-attachment non- clinging in ways that completely would be home in

149
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:11,279
Buddhism and um and uh it's not a surprise because

150
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:18,600
the way we can see clearly see something beautiful here in this world is so

151
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:25,360
fantastic when we do this inner work in uh teaching in in Buddhism in

152
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,720
Mahayana Buddhism in Zen Buddhism is go something like this uh when your mind is

153
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,000
pure the world is pure when the mind is pure you see the world and a certain

154
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,839
kind of Purity and um so this work on your your own heart your own mind understanding it

155
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:52,000
seeing how it is doing that work of really recognizing where the harming is how we

156
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,120
harm ourselves and um and finding a way not to do it and for many of us part of that

157
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:06,000
work is to deal with all the lawyers in the mind there are some really clever

158
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,438
lawyers in there who will make a really good case

159
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,520
that it's okay to harm sometimes it's to harm other people

160
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,600
they deserve it how else am I going to take care of myself what other choice do we

161
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,640
have and and uh sometimes the lawyers represent you

162
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,520
of course I have to harm myself I'm such a terrible person you know I deserve

163
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,039
it so part of the task in this practice is

164
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,280
to question the lawyers but when the lawyers

165
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:52,799
come remember don't harm them receive them as old

166
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:59,679
friends receive them calmly kindly listen to them

167
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,120
but don't believe them believe in

168
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,840
non-harming and then finally what I'd like to offer around this thing

169
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:18,240
believing uh many of us believe things that maybe we shouldn't be

170
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,960
believing um recently I talked to someone who said

171
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,159
that I don't I don't believe I'm capable of doing something that needs to be done

172
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:37,039
I don't think I'm capable that's my belief and um and instead of uh when

173
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,360
when you have when that when you that occurs to you change that your language

174
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,679
don't say don't say this is what I

175
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,600
believe say this is what I'm

176
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:58,960
believing and if you want to get extra credit

177
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,840
you say for right now this is what I'm

178
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:12,080
believing the difference is huge if you say I believe it's like now it's a solid

179
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:20,760
truthful statement like this is how it is and like who's going to find a way out of that but if it's just an act of

180
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:27,240
believing right now this is what I'm believing then it's not so solid it's

181
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,400
like well it's just right now is just an act and it's an activity of the

182
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:40,720
mind and the focus on Buddhism is not so much on belief or at all on belief but

183
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,559
rather on the activity the mind is doing and turns out that

184
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:53,159
believing when there's a belief there's an activity of the Mind

185
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:59,039
happening and that is called believing and now we're that and that

186
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,240
puts the mirror back on the mindfulness back on what's the

187
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:11,679
nature what's the quality the characteristic of that act the act of

188
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:19,159
believing and um so um what do you

189
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:26,760
believe long ago I believed now I act we're always acting there's always

190
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:34,760
action and so so um what's the so then um

191
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,640
um what teachings do you rely on now long ago I relied on

192
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:48,760
teachings now I rely on what I know so and what what can you

193
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,919
know maybe you don't know ultimate truths but if you pay attention you can

194
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,120
know the actions that you're involved in and if the action has to do with

195
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:05,480
thinking then you know oh I'm thinking something I'm thinking about I'm thinking about an ultimate truth I'm

196
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:13,480
thinking that I believe ult in this this that this is ultimately true the action of thinking is happening

197
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,000
and we often Overlook the action because we get caught up in what we're thinking

198
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,200
about we Overlook the fact that I'm believing because we're caught in the

199
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,360
belief this is what's true oh now I'm believing this now I'm

200
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:37,039
reacting to this now I'm feeling this now I'm wanting this to happen there's

201
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:44,559
always an action so what teachings do you rely on I rely on what I know and what you can

202
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,720
know is you can know the activities we're involved in that is a core Central

203
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:58,039
activity that we mindfulness brings attention to aren't you devoted to the Buddha long

204
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:03,200
long ago I was devoted to the Buddha now I am devoted to

205
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,360
non-harming once you start tracking the activities of the mind and speech and

206
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,159
body then you can start noticing oh this hurts there's an ouch in this there's

207
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:21,480
harm in this there's harm for me and maybe there's harm for others and then we can

208
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,840
question is this how I want to live my life is this the activity that I want to

209
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:34,200
be part of well then the lawyer comes and says it has to be this way there can't be any

210
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:41,760
other way oh that's a clever

211
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,760
lawyer but the lawyer is not the judge who has to decide don't let the

212
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:54,240
lawyers decide but what do you have faith in I

213
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,159
don't have faith I have confidence in non-harming

214
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:06,159
action what is your ultimate truth the end of doing any harm to

215
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,919
myself or others what is the good life

216
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:19,600
now a life lived without deliberate act any deliberate Act of body speech and

217
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,720
mind that harm self or others do you have no

218
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,440
desires no I do have desires I desire a world

219
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:38,000
committed to non-harming it's fine to have desires in

220
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:43,399
Buddhism but the desires have to be when then you're

221
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:50,640
Desiring so as you're Desiring desire in a way that doesn't cause harm find a way

222
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:58,000
to have desires that actually can be nourishing and supportive and helpful for you some desires are actually

223
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:06,559
helpful healing beneficial inspiring and any desire that has to do

224
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:15,159
with living a life of not causing harm living a life that does the opposite it lives with love and care and respect for

225
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:21,679
self and others those desires have desire them in ways that

226
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:30,039
are inspiring that that don't cause more harm someone have the desire to be

227
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:37,520
non-harming God I get I have to get on with it here I'm such a lousy person I need to I have to desire

228
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,919
non-harming you know and not to be the best non-harming person on my

229
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:50,480
block the very Act of wanting to non-harm is now harming you so we're always looking what in what

230
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,080
way am I inging what way what way what way am I

231
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,679
acting here what way am I thinking here what way am I intending here is the very

232
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:08,279
way in which I'm intending wanting thinking does that

233
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:15,120
Inspire this inner beauty of non-harming we're always tracking this

234
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:22,880
looking at it and now over time it has phenomenal results over time it creates

235
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,200
so much inner well-being and peace and space and goodness

236
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:35,279
that um maybe you'll be the person the Buddhist so-called Buddhist that goes into a town where

237
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:42,640
there's never many Buddhists and the religious Professor will come to you what do you believe

238
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,600
in I believe it's po important

239
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,960
to notice how I'm

240
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:00,960
believing now you understand why that's an important answer I believe it's important to study how

241
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,480
I'm believing so that I believe in a way

242
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,240
that doesn't cause any harm does the opposite it's it's nourishing it's supporting

243
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:19,039
it's it's liberating so those are my thoughts for

244
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,799
today so um now what do the lawyer

245
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:32,360
say or what questions do you have or com might you have yes

246
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:46,000
please this topic was spoton for something I'm struggling with right now

247
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,880
I realized that I am harming myself through perpetuating suffering over a

248
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,279
loss I've experienced so you harm yourself but by perpetuating the suffering

249
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:05,240
yes and so um I realize it's coming from

250
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:12,720
clinging a wonderful friendship I had and it's not wonderful at all anymore and I keep clinging to what it

251
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,840
was so the Buddha was so wonderful at giving us lists but I don't find a list

252
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,159
for how to let go I think that's just the hardest thing for me oh there's a

253
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:29,520
there's a really there's a really good list which

254
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:37,960
one it's a list that has only one item in it yeah I need steps I need 12 steps to

255
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:44,960
learn to let go it's repeatedly my biggest okay well then problem well then I'll give you four steps

256
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:51,320
okay be mindful of your body be mindful of your feelings be mindful of your mind

257
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,960
States and be mindful of uh the activities of your mind the four

258
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,880
foundations of mindfulness so when you when you have the particular suffering that you have um go through the

259
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,720
checklist of those four and and if you haven't if you're not really recently familiar with the four foundations of

260
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,760
mindfulness really kind of study them a little bit and uh and then um you know

261
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:21,000
that's a checklist it just it takes a lot of familiarity a lot of mindfulness a lot of looking at it and seeing what's

262
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,640
going on here um not analytically but uh what What's the inging what's the

263
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,399
activities that are happening now in the body in the the mind in the heart and you have to spend a lot of time just

264
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:39,600
being mindful of it and um and um and so also remember that mindfulness is also

265
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,720
not quite a good word we're we're mindfulness

266
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,760
sing we're doing mindfulness we're practicing the activity of mindfulness

267
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:57,039
and then the question is how are you being mindful are you doing it holding on for de life are are you holding on

268
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:05,519
are you doing it with with uh greed with aversion to what's happening and uh uh

269
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:11,039
do the mindfulness sing in a way that feels

270
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,480
good I must be missing something because I'm actually doing a practice so similar

271
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,640
I mean it's like almost dad on my coach was taking me through I catch myself I

272
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:28,600
wake up almost every morning with these thoughts so I catch myself oh I wish I had said that or oh

273
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,840
it hurts so much when she said this or oh my gosh that was so wonderful when we were friends like that it's Poss it's

274
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,440
possible but then I stop I look I say oh I'm saying this and then I rub my

275
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,399
fingers together I check in with my body my breathing every damn morning it comes

276
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:53,480
back so I don't know you that well in this regard right but I suspect that you're doing all this from the neck

277
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,880
up and that uh do it once your belly is really Rel

278
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:08,720
relaxed find a way good posture really find your let your belly be deeply relaxed and then do the work do the

279
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:15,000
practice I will try that from the bottom up rather than the top down yeah yeah I think you're right I'm doing it in a as

280
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,600
a mental construct I'm going step one step two step three yeah

281
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:29,799
yeah okay that'll be weird thank you so you have it go

282
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,080
ahead but let's stay on topic if you have an looks like you might have an announcement noning but it's an

283
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:43,480
announcement right it might be how about waiting a couple of minutes because I think I think it's better to kind of

284
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:49,120
stay on track a little bit here rather than changing the topic we end with

285
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:57,919
you then can you give that mic to the person out there in the outer Hall the outer Hall oh and then we can

286
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:06,080
do you after her thank you you have to turn it on green light

287
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:14,240
light goes on thank you um isn't having expectations of others it's always um

288
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,639
harming them and harming yourself and if you have no expectations then you are

289
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:27,360
all alone I think having expectations when there's been I think having uh an expect

290
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:34,559
ation when there's been an agreement is reasonable you know so if someone

291
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:40,760
promises something and you agreed like together like this is what we're going to do I think that's that's that's one

292
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:46,320
of the functions of an of an agreement is now we can expect that something will happen we can trust something will

293
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,799
happen in a particular way and then if the agreement is broken we feel kind of

294
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:57,480
hurt but if there has been no agreement between the people then I have to we

295
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:03,720
have to be very very careful about the expectation because then we're projecting something on the

296
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,919
situation and um that might not other people don't agree haven't agreed to

297
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:15,639
we're bringing our values and putting it on other people and um now there might be

298
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:21,679
implicit agreements we have in our society you know like um when the

299
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:28,720
traffic light is red we don't drive through it we have expectation that that's how

300
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:36,200
we all agree to drive but you never asked the other driver you promis not to drive you know

301
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,519
we kind of have all kinds sometimes implicit agreements um so I think that when

302
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:48,320
there's an agreement we it's reasonable to have some expectation and then people

303
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,480
are accountable to the agreement say I I expected that what happened what was going on you can you have something you

304
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:01,200
can talk about but expectation for on one for on on oneself and expectations on others uh

305
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,480
are also source of a lot of suffering other people suffer we suffer uh we have

306
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,320
standards we hold people ourselves to standards we hold hold other people to that's much higher than they can

307
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:18,399
actually live by and and we can be it can be oppressive it can be harmful to

308
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:25,320
ex to have expectations of self and others which are unreasonable and um and so this is why

309
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:31,679
this this mindfulness where we looking at how again the not the expects

310
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:38,519
expectations are important to look at but the uh what's going on for you when you're expecting when you have an when

311
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:44,200
you're doing the action of expecting expectation um are you what do you want

312
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:50,760
what are you attached to what are you hoping for what are you afraid of this gives you enough to think

313
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:56,480
about thank you what if it's a kind of complicated

314
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:04,360
situation I'm thinking of an example let's say I have a pond and I have some fish in it and then there's an invasive

315
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,638
species that now live in the pond that's killing my fish

316
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,720
so if I don't harm that species of some sort my fish will all

317
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:21,000
die then then what should I do in that case

318
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,040
there's all kinds of things first of all I love it when people ask the question I

319
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,839
have this problem invasive fish I don't want to kill them but what can I do that

320
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:39,040
people that ask that question I I I welcome so much this is fantastic that they're asking rather than immediately

321
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,000
go get the poison to kill the fish and then the question well let's think about it maybe let's do some

322
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,240
research and find out what we can do and um and maybe there's something can be

323
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:57,560
done maybe there are traps you can put in that can trap the fish and take them where they belong which is maybe

324
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:05,880
expensive but maybe that's nicer than just killing them um so maybe there's something can be done maybe uh the your

325
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:13,880
fish are really small and that's a really big fish and if you take a big net fishing net through the pond you get

326
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:20,320
all the bad fish on one side and the all the small fish stay on the other side of

327
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,040
the net and then you can kind of let's figure out what we can do now maybe we maybe that's a good way of living and

328
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:31,800
maybe they can just kind of you know share share the pond together that way

329
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:38,079
or maybe um you realize the reason why the big fish are eating the small ones

330
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:45,359
is because they're hungry but they actually have in their where they came from they have a preferred

331
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:51,560
diet and so let's get let's bring in the preferred diet and they'll leave the small fish alone so I'm just making up

332
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,960
ideas but it's possible by thinking about it and exploring and but sometimes

333
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:04,520
it takes a while sometimes just killing them seems like it takes care of it really quickly but then because you killed them

334
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:10,240
the other your fish now think oh killing is

335
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,800
right and so they start killing each other for this slightest little you know they' learned that killing was possible

336
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,520
in this Pond and you know you don't know the repercussions that killing has so um

337
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:31,760
and then there's also the it could also be that the um the invasive species was coming

338
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:38,280
like the the the the fish the person didn't read the news and didn't read

339
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:45,440
that uh if you bring in this particular kind of feed it has this fish eggs in it

340
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,200
and you have to be really careful oh but it's so much work who cares about doing that and I don't believe in anyway and

341
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:57,680
and so then there's no preventive work done so if if you have the equivalent

342
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,640
today of a pond with fish in it think ahead notice what's happening

343
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,760
set up a situation so in the future there's not that

344
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:15,880
problem so so if people who want to live in non harming life they also need to be

345
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,359
uh proactive they need to set the conditions in now so that uh so that in

346
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:29,040
5 10 20 years 50 years that um uh there's not any problems and to only

347
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,960
look at the present moment uh is very myopic when it comes to living a life of

348
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:41,359
non-harming so does that give you some ideas yes there was not an ultimate

349
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,078
answer but it's it's it's a

350
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:55,599
beginning maybe last one thank

351
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:02,440
you so when I'm thinking about invasive fish and a fish pond I'm thinking about

352
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:08,440
Israel and Gaza and I'm wondering I don't know how to how to think about it and I wonder if

353
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:14,680
you have any suggestions yes I mean the talk today was partly a response to that without

354
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,839
mentioning it explicitly and um and one of the reasons

355
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:25,319
not to mention explicitly is I'll tell you a story about Tik

356
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:31,560
Nan uh tnat Han lived in Vietnam during the war between Northern Vietnam and

357
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:37,079
Southern Vietnam he lived right in the area where the conflict was most active

358
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:43,200
battles back and forth and fields nearby and um and he was dedicated to

359
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:50,440
doing it a different way not fighting he was dedicated to non-harming and he had a whole group of

360
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:56,240
monastics and women and men who were out there trying to support everyone in both sides of the conflict and offer a

361
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:03,640
different approach to it all and because of that both neither side trusted

362
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:11,480
him the PE because he was supporting the northern Vietnamese you trying to help them and maybe even offer Medical Care

363
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:18,640
the southern Vietnamese didn't trust him and vice versa and so the situation in Gaza in

364
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:27,200
Israel is awful there so much pain but and to uh and even so uh to

365
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,240
take the middle view the middle way that really wants the best for both

366
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:41,040
sides uh is kind of difficult to say because one way or the other people on either side gets upset that you don't

367
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,359
understand how terrible it is for us and and how much we've been violated and and

368
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:53,440
so how much we've been kind of forgotten by the world or all kinds of things and so um and so I didn't want to talk about

369
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:00,319
it directly and uh and and not talking about it is also very difficult because

370
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:07,040
then you're ignoring you know and people say you're ignoring my people I don't feel safe and but when there's both

371
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,160
people who feel that way then you know it's a very difficult thing to be in

372
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:22,000
that to have that middle so the middle for me is not being aloof or indifferent but is um having a heart that's really

373
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,480
concerned for everyone involved and um and is dedicated to

374
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:33,280
finding best we can way of non-harming

375
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,280
without

376
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,960
um I don't know without

377
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:56,440
um I don't know without maybe giving the question earlier today without um

378
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,520
projecting expectations on what people

379
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,960
do thank you
