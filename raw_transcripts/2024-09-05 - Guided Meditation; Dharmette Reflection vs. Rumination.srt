10
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:32,920
us practice together e

11
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:24,400
to fully contact our heart we often uh need to relax

12
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,360
if you're sleepy if it's late can still actually

13
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,879
relax but counterbalancing the relaxation with a certain kind of

14
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:09,959
uh if you're sitting expression of your spine reaching upwards Towards the Sky

15
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,200
maybe you take some Fuller

16
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,720
breaths just kind of filling out your body with your

17
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,760
breath e

18
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:57,800
and we breathe and relax so that we might become

19
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,199
more sensitive to to

20
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,199
love kind of love that uh spreads

21
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,639
the more settled and still we become the

22
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:10,280
easier the awareness takes the Hue of Love

23
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,560
kindness for

24
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,800
no contracts with the moment

25
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:22,440
just offering your heart mind up to it

26
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:02,840
the posture of our heart is one where no matter what comes its

27
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,919
way pleasure or

28
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:17,560
pain we trust that it will become love

29
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,680
can you put your heart in that posture

30
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,160
just breathing Into Your Heart

31
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,360
Center kind of deep willingness

32
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:57,360
to feel our life as it's constellating in this moment it's uh joy and

33
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
sorrow

34
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

35
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

36
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
e e

37
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:20,199
we sense the the the pains in our life the nuts

38
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:24,279
in our heart

39
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:37,600
and uh just practice bathing

40
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,800
them and Care

41
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,800
kindness sometimes harder to believe from the inside

42
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,120
but you're no different than any other

43
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,199
person and pain is uh worthy of

44
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:11,199
care

45
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
kindness

46
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
e e

47
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:46,680
maybe there's a an image or word a phrase that kind of catches

48
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,240
the thread of your

49
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,920
breathing just letting your heart

50
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,399
soften be softened by

51
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,959
life e

52
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,480
it's almost like our breathing refines out some of

53
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:41,519
the holding and pushing so that love catches the thread

54
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,279
of our

55
00:16:51,880 --> 00:17:00,720
breath maybe starts to feel natural to in tone

56
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,600
the

57
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,480
words i' be well

58
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:37,280
may my uh heart be as wide as the

59
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,640
world may I take

60
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,759
refuge in love

61
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,679
just abiding in

62
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
care

63
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,760
e e

64
00:19:52,960 --> 00:20:02,120
the attention wanders meanders away from this theme of love uh just uh

65
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,679
forgive forgive

66
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:20,240
yourself just reestablish yourself

67
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,880
in this

68
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:36,120
abiding like all the cells of your body become

69
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,679
uh animated by non

70
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:53,240
violence the heart becomes aligned

71
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:07,400
because it has no faith in hate or apathy we

72
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:15,120
go maybe just for this minute we go all

73
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,360
in on

74
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:29,640
love don't worry about the details of

75
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,720
life right now just now it's okay in

76
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:41,279
fact very good to go all

77
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:47,559
in love kindness

78
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
compassion

79
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

80
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

81
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

82
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

83
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

84
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

85
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

86
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
e e

87
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:49,720
even though we know can never

88
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:59,158
be still makes a lot of sense to affirm the wish

89
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,799
may all beings be

90
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:13,600
well may all beings be safe and

91
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,960
protected may all beings know

92
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
peace

93
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

94
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
e e

95
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,080
e

96
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,960
okay

97
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:43,360
so so I have um a lot of uh very reasonable

98
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:52,679
thoughts and a lot of kind of dumb thoughts uh but uh my dumb thoughts

99
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:59,159
generally don't get me into trouble anymore

100
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:05,679
and it's not that I sort of like listen to my reasonable thoughts and ignore my

101
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:14,039
dumb thoughts it's it's more the sense is like that I I no longer ask my thoughts

102
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:20,960
to do things for my life that thoughts can't

103
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:27,919
do and we ask um you know we ask our our

104
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,240
our thoughts to do so much when you get down to it it's like okay how do they

105
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:41,320
function in our life and in a lot of of beautiful ways

106
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:47,639
but but we ask them to do too much we ask thoughts to really game out and

107
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:56,120
protect us from uncertainty to digest uh emotionally painful

108
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:02,760
experience to make us feel good about ourselves to provide [Music]

109
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:11,240
meaning and a question arose in a recent um s meeting that like

110
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,919
um uh the the woman uh asked Sarah asked

111
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:22,559
uh what's the difference between reflection and

112
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,559
rumination and on the one hand um

113
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:34,519
we can say just you know conceptual understandings of the Dharma are

114
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:40,720
not themselves liberating but there is a vital place

115
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:49,639
for contemplation and reflection on the Dharma path and we're instructed you know often

116
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:57,279
often to hold the teachings in mind hold the teachings in mind to investigate and

117
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:03,519
reflect to recall the the Buddha the beautiful qualities of the

118
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:10,080
Buddha uh to recall our potential for awakening to recall the kind of karmic

119
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:17,399
reverberations of causing harm we're asked to reflect on all of

120
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:24,279
this thinking but rumination gives thinking a

121
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:30,360
bad name and rumination maybe we say is a

122
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:37,559
particular uh spe species of thinking that tries to accomplish what with words

123
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:45,519
what can only be accomplished with action wisdom letting

124
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:53,760
go so rumination defined uh kind of you know in clinical world is something like

125
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,559
repetitive prolonged negative very loopy

126
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:08,158
thinking about one's self feelings one's current concerns

127
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:15,638
ones uh often you know upsetting experiences

128
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:24,440
memory and rumination is a little like uh looking the ruminative mind is

129
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,520
looking for the last missing puzzle

130
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,599
piece except you're playing chess

131
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:40,878
you and sometimes rumination masquerades as kind of existential

132
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:47,638
seeking you know they sound like ruminative questions sometimes sound like Dharma

133
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:54,320
questions but they're not and they're it's known to kind of

134
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:02,520
have uh some you know compound suffering magnifying and prolonging negative moods

135
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:09,160
interfering with problem solving making people typically less effective in

136
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,640
action and um and reducing sensitivity to like

137
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:22,000
changing conditions and the context and how to adjust you know and so rumination

138
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,880
is often often when we look at it it's sort of trying to use

139
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:36,720
thoughts to make things go away often refuses the truth of duka you

140
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:43,400
know that there is suffering and the ruminative mind is sort of obsessively

141
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:50,240
looking for some Duca free pathway forward and that just does

142
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:56,040
not it doesn't exist right we will not we will not the ruminative mind is

143
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:02,599
essentially trying to like outs smart the first Noble truth but it just keeps spinning cuz

144
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:09,520
intuitively we know can't outsmart this we keep

145
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:18,480
thinking rumination um fails to learn from regret and past

146
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,040
disappointment so it might it might our mind might be going over and over the past again but it's not actually

147
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,680
extracting actual wisdom and there's a sense in me that

148
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:37,280
until we've extracted the wisdom from the pain of the past our mind just will

149
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:45,359
not put it down it will not put it down rumination often a kind of

150
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,560
rationalization of inaction it feels like our thinking we feel so busy

151
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:58,200
thinking so you know kind of hermetically sealed off in the world of thought and the

152
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:08,280
thought is intense and busy it feels like we're doing something it feels like we're getting somewhere and we're just

153
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:16,400
spinning we're not actually in not the ruminative mode facing our problems

154
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:22,079
headon but in fact often avoiding avoiding feeling what needs to

155
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:28,319
be felt maybe some uh disappoint ointment of how

156
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:34,640
something unfolded or regret for the ways our own pain overflowed from our

157
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:42,520
own heart spilled into the lives of others maybe it's uh rumination is kind

158
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:50,599
of like the way we avoid opening to the ambivalent that runs

159
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:59,119
through the center of the world maybe our ego has been titilated

160
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:06,000
in some way and we're trying to like Smooth the story of

161
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,839
self with more words to kind of like treat the wound of

162
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:22,400
self with words in other words uh romanation

163
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:29,160
really trying to solve what is at base an emotional puzzle

164
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,319
with thought and the word means chewing you

165
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:39,640
know trying to like digest suffering with our

166
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:47,920
thoughts but um but as I said thoughts do not function well as digestive

167
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:59,440
enzymes uh language language is so um it's powerful and it's like limited

168
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:07,800
uh language is um it's kind of possessive and

169
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:14,280
domineering language itself words thinking this is Maggie Maggie

170
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:22,440
Nelson uh she writes um afraid of assertion always trying to get out of

171
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,920
totalizing language language that rides Ruff shad

172
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,440
over specificity realizing this is another form of

173
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,680
paranoia literary CR critic uh Bart uh found the exit to this merry girl round

174
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:48,040
by reminding himself that quote it is language which it is assertive not

175
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:55,480
he it's absurd he says to try to flee from language's assertive Nature Nature

176
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:01,960
by adding to each sentence some little phrase of

177
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:10,599
uncertainty as if anything that came out of language could make language

178
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:20,720
tremble our stories don't tremble they

179
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:29,279
assert and so what what are we to do as practitioners what are we to do

180
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:36,720
um well first uh Dharma Dharma practice is about perceiving the

181
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:45,319
imperfection of thought we we it's it's really Vivid on retreat but

182
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:52,200
we can see it elsewhere we perceive the kind of building up the the construction

183
00:40:52,200 --> 00:41:00,040
the fabrication of uh this kind of world of thought that we temporarily

184
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:07,440
inhabit that we we often can't see Beyond the Horizon of that

185
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:18,599
land and then because we're paying attention we like see that world

186
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:24,119
collapse and when we see that enough with enough

187
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:30,000
vividness we do not for get the emptiness of

188
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,480
thought we might have to see it a million

189
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:43,079
times but then we become like just slightly estranged from all

190
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:53,760
words we digest Feeling by feeling that's what it is to be

191
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,480
mindful of feeling is to feel and this is really

192
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,440
equinity the the development of uh this kind of supple relationship with

193
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:15,119
emotionally charged Body Sensations and my sense is that um we we

194
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:23,359
must be willing to actually um to feel our way through something if

195
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,119
we're to extract wisdom from pain

196
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,480
rumination thrives on uh on avoidance

197
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:44,559
and mindfulness is um it's an approach the orientation is one of approach

198
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:52,480
gently in our own time with a lot of support behind us you

199
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,359
know but an approach

200
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:04,520
sometimes that support is love or

201
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:13,400
s or faith but we in our own time

202
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,119
approach sometimes the antidote to rumination is just like because it's

203
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:25,800
such quick sand that to even direct attention to it to try to be mindful of

204
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:33,000
it to try to let go of that to try to to work with it in any way is it's like a

205
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:41,000
kind of gravitational force field that just keeps pulling us under and so we do something else we do

206
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,079
something else maybe move our

207
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:52,359
body uh one of my teachers shinzen young said sometimes equinity is expressed um

208
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:59,200
not by being with something but by being able to put it down being able to put

209
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:06,680
something down that's a a different species of equinity but uh when we allow something

210
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:14,078
to become distant background that's not avoiding it's a kind of species of

211
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:21,640
equinity and sometimes um to break the inertia of the mind we we just must act

212
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:28,400
we do something anything that moves against the quicksand

213
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:38,000
uh and um maybe lastly I should note like

214
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,680
um spiritual friendship you know this is uh the ruminative

215
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:50,280
mind um often needs ACC company the stability

216
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:58,480
of another stability of their heart so reflection rumination

217
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,040
offer this for your uh

218
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,799
