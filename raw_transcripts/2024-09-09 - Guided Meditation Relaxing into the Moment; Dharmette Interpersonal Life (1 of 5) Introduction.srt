3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,000
welcome my name is Matthew I know a lot of these names but

um and see what uh see what happens so uh please uh settle

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,960
in e

9
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,840
meditation is a way of being deeply honest with the

10
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,159
moment and trusting that in in meeting

11
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,479
the moment as it is uh the heart

12
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,360
unfolds trusting that uh the deepest healing does not

13
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,120
come from

14
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,959
pretending but from a kind of

15
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:31,840
fidelity to how life is in this moment

16
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,239
and so taking some Fuller

17
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:53,200
breaths breath that reaches down into your belly up into your shoulders

18
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,599
breath that says to some part

19
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,239
of your mind that doubts

20
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,840
it it's okay to be

21
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,159
here like this

22
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,760
now

23
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,760
for e

24
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,720
in the Deep habit of treating the moment as a kind

25
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,320
of problem to

26
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,479
solve we just uh

27
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:29,520
relax and trust that uh whatever the raw material of this moment is

28
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:41,560
whether it's uh Pleasant or unpleasant it all has equal potential to soften our

29
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,400
heart to wake us

30
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,759
up so we just relax into our life as it

31
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:57,759
is

32
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,560
through our

33
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
breathing

34
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

35
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,520
e e

36
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:14,680
it's almost like we use our breath to give us the the courage just to be

37
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:26,280
here so let your breathing animate the front of your

38
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,440
body but also the back of your body

39
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:43,200
feels like life is in front of us but it's all around

40
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:56,160
us bringing awareness to the back of your body

41
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,160
letting the movement of your

42
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:21,240
breathing Ripple through uh not just your torso

43
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,120
but through the lower half of your body

44
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
too e

45
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,480
our breathing can enliven what is numbed out and

46
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,320
soothe what's overactive

47
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,200
activated so there's a sense of our body

48
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,560
being unified by

49
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
awareness

50
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

51
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

52
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

53
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,160
e e

54
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:40,600
to solve our worries we have to

55
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,880
think but to dissolve

56
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:58,560
them we breathe and relax into awareness

57
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,600
we don't insist that the the knots and complexities the worries and the

58
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,600
problems untangle themsel immediately but there's a kind of trust

59
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,600
that our whole life looks different from the vantage

60
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,959
point of

61
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,279
Tranquility

62
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:53,560
surrender so we let our breathing ground us help us

63
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,959
sit more deeply in our bones

64
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,240
help us appreciate the subtle

65
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,240
soothing quality of

66
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
gravity

67
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

68
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

69
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

70
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

71
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
e e

72
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,080
maybe some place uh in your body the

73
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:45,840
your breathing is uh most prominent mouth or nostrils

74
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,799
your chest or

75
00:18:52,039 --> 00:19:00,559
belly maybe a sense of the whole body breathing

76
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,399
but you can just take

77
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,919
refuge in this

78
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
moment

79
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
e e

80
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:37,480
and the nature of thought is they all feel somehow

81
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:59,760
important but we uh we come to trust that there is something

82
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,559
even more important than our

83
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
thoughts

84
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

85
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

86
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

87
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

88
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

89
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

90
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

91
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

92
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

93
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
e e

94
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:23,399
there's a sense that no matter how life unfolds what problems

95
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:28,679
get solved and which don't this

96
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:31,360
will have

97
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:39,080
mattered to have honored the moment in this

98
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:50,679
way to have developed a sensory

99
00:27:51,960 --> 00:28:00,120
Clarity kind of refining the landscape of this

100
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:07,600
moment stabilizing the heart mind or

101
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:21,320
attention resting from the tussle with

102
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,120
experience this will have mattered

103
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
e

104
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
e e

105
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
for e

106
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,600
okay so um yeah good to sit with

107
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:25,840
you so a a friend uh a friend of mine described moving

108
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:34,080
from what she called uh egocentric life to to Dharma Centric

109
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:41,840
life and that that means that we're we're moving out of kind of narrow

110
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,200
self-referential existence so much of our existence can be

111
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:55,360
self-referential moving out of that into the sense of Life animated by Dharma

112
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:05,799
Dharma uh kind of infusing all spheres of our life and that of course

113
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:13,960
includes our um our relational lives the theme for this week interpersonal

114
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:20,679
life that uh a Dharma Centric life blesses the

115
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:29,039
relational realm in many ways we of course affect each other

116
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:36,880
right a life is many Ripples and a Dharma Centric life

117
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,159
perhaps we say ripples out uh joy and

118
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:49,960
safety and peace those are the ripples emanating from the Dharma

119
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:59,399
heart what um we might ask like what makes a life worth living

120
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:08,600
and there are many answers to that but one very good answer is other

121
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:15,679
people um Delights that are simply not possible in

122
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:21,320
isolation there's some help we can never

123
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:29,760
give ourselves there's some healings we need others for

124
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:38,440
Tony uh Kushner said um the smallest indivisible human unit is two people not

125
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:45,279
one one is a fiction from such Nets of souls

126
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,840
societies the social World human life

127
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:59,240
Springs the sense of of belonging of relatedness that's considered

128
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:06,638
fundamental fundamental in the sense that if it's frustrated we

129
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:14,118
suffer and how this practice is about perceiving ourselves perceiving our

130
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:21,240
minds clearly but how do we do that how do we actually see our minds our habit

131
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:26,398
energies how do we see what is not conscious to

132
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:33,118
us we we rely on other people we cannot see the back of our

133
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,720
head and so we need others to develop

134
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:48,599
wisdom I was told in the uh in the Quaker tradition that Revelation is never held

135
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:53,760
by an individual it is in fact a property of

136
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,440
groups I was always touched by that that consider like or maybe Enlightenment as

137
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:09,839
a property of the group sometimes I've uh thought that

138
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:16,119
one one aspect of mental health is something like the congruence

139
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:22,960
between self understanding the story we tell about ourselves and how a kind of

140
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:30,320
collection of well-intentioned people in one's life would tell the story

141
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:39,160
me how much does that do those converge between how I see myself and

142
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:47,680
and how a group of people of Good Will would collectively describe me or

143
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:55,880
you this interpersonal realm is uh one of

144
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:01,760
uh you know incredible humility and

145
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:08,680
longing and grief and ecstasy and courage and vulnerability and

146
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:16,760
shame and Grace and healing it is like many many Dharma themes in this

147
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:23,560
interpersonal life and as sometimes say that uh that

148
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:30,240
other people are are like steroids for our parames and our

149
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,599
kesas for our the beautiful qualities of our heart and for the habits that get us

150
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:43,079
into trouble other people act like steroids for those habit

151
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:50,119
energies and So Lisa the the brain scientist emotion researcher Lisa

152
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:56,920
Feldman Barrett says the best thing for a human nervous system is another human

153
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:03,920
and the wor worst thing for a human nervous system is another

154
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,440
human when I was like three or something

155
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,839
and my younger brother Gregory just learned how to sit up on

156
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:21,640
his own you know like had the whatever abdominal strength to sit up and we were

157
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:27,000
at some like I don't know family gathering or something and everyone's

158
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,400
cheering my brother on as uh he he's uh

159
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,839
demonstrating this newly acquired skill you know and

160
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:43,680
uh and I did not appreciate the relative

161
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:50,800
balance of attention being paid and uh I don't remember saying this but I believe

162
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:58,760
it I just whispered me knock Gregory down

163
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:05,240
and I ran tackled my brother which he was not able to sustain he was knocked

164
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:11,839
off center by that and uh still to this day anytime I'm being a little

165
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:18,319
domineering or something with my younger brother he just says me knock Gregory down you

166
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:25,240
know that's three I was like eight you know and

167
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:31,000
really kind of seeing the ibility and suffering of my

168
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,520
parents you know and uh kind of not being able to

169
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:43,040
stand it just spun me so deeply their simple

170
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:51,119
fallibility their inability to like insulate me from

171
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:58,359
dukka at 12 being like I don't even remember what but kind of heartbroken

172
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:04,640
over some social drama and I concluded I remember like oh yeah like the

173
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:13,079
conclusion in my young mind was like insecurity is at the center of emotional

174
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:21,880
pain it's the Bedrock as a teen being so angry and

175
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:30,839
having no idea no idea how to deal with it discharge it channel that diffuse it

176
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:40,119
and just spilling out you know exclusively within my family I sort

177
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:46,920
of managed it outside of the nuclear family but spilled you know

178
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,960
into uh home life in a really U profound

179
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,800
way at 16 not having had a sexual relation reltionship any kind of

180
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:06,839
significant romantic something and just like am I going to be okay like is there

181
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:14,480
something not okay with my heart and at 18 going off to to school

182
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:21,200
to college and feeling so um yeah just

183
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:30,599
intimidated by others and kind of quietly becoming more judgmental and

184
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:38,800
competitive and arrogant and we all have our our moments

185
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:45,319
and those are moments from what is a very fortunate life there are of course

186
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:50,560
moments of incredible cruelty and

187
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:56,079
danger so our relational life our life

188
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:02,680
is uh um is about sending and receiving

189
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:08,119
sending pain receiving pain sending

190
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:14,280
love receiving love

191
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:22,960
and so our practice must be a kind of relational practice

192
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,000
now and on the one hand it's important to have some aspects of of practice that

193
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,280
are untethered to any outcome we don't do it for any result we we don't do it

194
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:40,720
to get better to heal ourselves to be better neighbors Partners whatever it's

195
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,720
like no just for the richness of it just for the Delight of

196
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:52,480
it if this were the only moment there were no future I would want to just be

197
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:58,400
poised in Awareness but from another perspective

198
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:06,599
our practice is indeed dedicated to an outcome and the outcome is the welfare

199
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:12,880
of others that our practice be of blessing

200
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,280
in our life and

201
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:24,720
so we fold in you know this these

202
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:32,000
relational kind of question and Dynamics to our practice how how much have the

203
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,000
lessons we've learned on the cushion generalized to the interpersonal

204
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,000
realm right we we know like oh yeah greed hate and delusion those are dead

205
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,079
ends but all of the sudden often in the context of other

206
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:59,119
people they seem pretty appetizing right

207
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:07,400
when I'm alone you know my Neurosis doesn't bump up against other

208
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:13,960
things and then it does usually aided by

209
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:20,800
another and it sort of shatters some idealized Vision I have about myself and

210
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:29,960
I want to have Fidelity to those realizations when I teach or practice I I try never to

211
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:36,400
forget my freedom nor my suffering and the interpersonal realm is this Zone

212
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,880
where we investigate what aspects of our insight has stabilized and what hasn't

213
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,640
what's generalized what hasn't what have I

214
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:54,040
realized meaning like what parts of the teachings are

215
00:43:54,040 --> 00:44:00,920
real not merely intellectual but like muscle memory they're real we see in the

216
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:07,760
interpersonal realm what's been realized and what remains slightly

217
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:16,359
intellectualized understanding of the Dharma this is a realm of um courage and

218
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:22,680
patience and self forgiveness and we approach it with some

219
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:29,040
wonder and freshness an opportunity to see our minds to realize

220
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:36,240
the teachings more fully uh with a kind of reverence for

221
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,680
what gets evoked in us what we evoke in

222
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:49,000
others and so as we we come to uh the end of uh our time this morning um we

223
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,440
the invitation is to something like investigate you

224
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:00,400
know what what happens to your mind mind uh

225
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:07,280
when alone when with others what gets soothed by others what gets activated

226
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:14,720
the Gaze of the other is a very reliable way of evoking the conial sense of self

227
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:20,119
what happens in that just notice with

228
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:27,480
care yeah and so um

229
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:35,760
we'll gather back uh tomorrow we'll uh sort of unfold uh this this theme

230
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:43,119
together and uh happy to to be with you and uh wish you a good good day look

231
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:48,040
