168
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:09,900
a very intimate thing we're not at a meditation center when everybody comes together we're all coming to each

169
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:16,740
other's homes so in a way it's like oh take a moment when you go into small groups maybe go around first and welcome

170
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:24,240
just each person will welcome the other person Welcome to My All welcome to Myspace and just go around and just the

171
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:30,060
sense of welcoming just welcoming each other um and so that would be their first

172
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:35,400
round meeting meeting each other with welcoming with a sense of kindness and

173
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,280
see what might arise or might be playfulness right the playfulness of meeting the unexpected we never know

174
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:48,359
what's going to happen the next moment and then go go another round again each person can share something don't don't

175
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:54,960
direct don't ask questions just show up show up with your kindness with your hospitality

176
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:02,880
um hello welcome and if you like you can share something about how this practice was for you maybe just a nugget maybe

177
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:10,079
just 30 seconds and then the next person and the next person that would be the second round or you can say pass so the

178
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,619
first round you welcome each other to your space and have fun with it this is kind of why not I don't know if you've

179

181
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,480
is to be able to practice with others so

182
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:42,020

184
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:57,078
kindness and here we go opening all the ropes

185
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:06,859
