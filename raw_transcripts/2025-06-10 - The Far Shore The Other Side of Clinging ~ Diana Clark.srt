00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:07,559
welcome welcome hello good evening

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,720
while we were meditating the thought arose like "Oh why didn't I do this earlier?" I don't know it's just I just

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,560
love sitting with you guys and just think like "Oh I should just spend the whole day here at IMC and whoever shows

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,240
up and sit with them or something like this."

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:37,079
Excuse me so last week I introduced this idea the simile of the raft

6
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,160
many of you might be familiar with this simile it's a well-known one gets

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,440
interpreted in a number of different ways and different emphases put on

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,199
different parts of it and last class well maybe I'll introduce

9
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:07,680
the idea what it is first so this uh it's part of Majima 22 the algatupama

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,439
suta kind of hard to say simile of the snake so it's in a suta that has a

11
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,560
number of different simileies but this one is simile of the raft

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,560
and it goes something like this imagine a person in the course of a journey

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:34,320
arrives at a great expanse of water whose nearshore is dubious and perilous

14
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,640
and the far shore is a sanctuary free of peril

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,320
but there's no fairy boat or bridge to cross the water

16
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,920
so the person thinks what if I collected grass twigs branches and leaves and

17
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,960
bound them together as a raft and supported by the raft and by paddling with my hands and feet I should then be

18
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,119
able to reach the other side of the shore the simile continues but I'm going to

19
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,640
stop here and talk about last week I talked about the nearshore being dubious

20
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,200
and perilous i'll say just a little bit about that but today I want to talk about the far shore and next week I'll

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,480
talk more about this idea of a raft so maybe I'll unpack a little bit more

22
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,239
this um this simile this idea of going on a journey we could say this is just

23
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,920
one's life one way we can consider it as a journey

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,959
it's not the only way and not doesn't work in all situations but one way could

25
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,959
be as a journey and this great expanse of water there something like that's

26
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:55,040
getting in the way that we just find ourselves in contact with or seeing or noticing or

27
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,640
experiencing and we could say that well even the

28
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,480
sutas talk about it can be considered like a flood like you know this thing that makes you feel overwhelmed there

29
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:15,120
something that's just uh coming this way and there's nothing to be done it feels like except to be swept away

30
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,120
and we don't like this feeling of being swept away feeling overwhelmed

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:31,040
but also there's a way in which we could understand this great expanse of water as just this existential dooka

32
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:40,560
i'm using this word dooka i always like to uh define it this way there's this huge broad range to just this mild

33
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:48,319
feeling like something's not right to oh my gosh this is the terrible most awful

34
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,159
thing that's ever happened so this one word for this wide range duka

35
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:01,280
and so there's this way in which sometimes when we encounter some terrible diagnosis for ourselves or for

36
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,720
a loved one this is some existential dooka like wow okay my life uh maybe

37
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:16,160
it's going to end in a way that I wasn't expecting or at a time I wasn't expecting or this person whom I love

38
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,280
maybe they are going to have some adjustment to their lifespan their

39
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,560
expected lifespan or or Maybe they're going to have a lot of pain or maybe we're going to have some a lot of pain

40
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,759
nobody wants this but often there's it can be avoided this is something that

41
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:42,800
life brings to us sometimes or maybe there's this way this sense of

42
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:50,479
dooka is the sense of like oh I just my life would be okay if only

43
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:58,080
if only those people over there would start behaving better would just

44
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,360
uh get it together or do what they should or you know the list is online

45
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,440
those people over there or maybe it's like oh my gosh if only this person over here

46
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,880
if only I had more willpower if only I could like force myself to do all the

47
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,479
things I know I should be doing but somehow am not doing or maybe if only I were different in some fundamental way

48
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:30,080
or it's amazing the things that we come up with how we think we should be different it's never ending right or it

49
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,120
can be endless and so this idea of the nearshore is

50
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,479
where you find yourself and it's only the nearshore because it's compared to something over

51
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,160
there otherwise it's just your life right that's happening but it's the nearshore

52
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:56,639
because it's not over there and over there is this far shore this idea that we have that somehow it's better it's

53
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,080
not in contact with this dooka somehow it's going to be better maybe it's not

54
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,639
clear to us exactly how or maybe it is clear to us of how everything would be fine as soon as we get there and we know

55
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,960
exactly what there is going to look at and so I want to talk a little bit about

56
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,000
this idea of the far shore

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,600
some of you might uh know this that sometimes it gets uh defined as nibbana

58
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,800
nibbana is the poly word for nirvana which is a way for awakening or

59
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,160
enlightenment or something like this it's not something that gets talked

60
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,759
about so often there a number of reasons for this I can imagine

61
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:50,479
maybe I I'll offer some one reason is it's guaranteed to not be

62
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,240
satisfying you're not going to get a description that feels like oh okay I got it yeah

63
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,919
okay yeah no problem it's there it doesn't have it's not possible for it to

64
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:09,360
have a description that is completely satisfying because the mind

65
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,960
that's trying to understand it is not the mind that can understand it

66
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,240
there's this way in which we want to we we do this all day long and it's very

67
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,960
helpful and useful where we there's an experience and then we slap a label out

68
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,240
of thin air in some ways you know it's a mental event stick it on and like oh okay this is frustration

69
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,560
and then we have a relationship with this word frustration meanwhile the relation the experience might have ended

70
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,360
or completely changed and is no longer that but we slap a label on it and then we have a relationship with the concept

71
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,400
the idea about it and nibbana

72
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,319
it's it's about not having concepts it's about how concepts are concepts they're

73
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:10,400
not actually what's being experienced they are about it's about just this um

74
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,319
it's sometimes defined as non-clinging and clinging ing happens in the obvious

75
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,639
ways please don't leave me i'll do anything if you don't leave type of thing that we can do whether that's we

76
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:29,240
don't want uh individuals to leave us or we don't want experiences to leave us

77
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:37,680
but it's uh this non-clinging and the gross ways and the really subtle ways

78
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,720
are the clinging to the idea that something should be clear and

79
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:55,160
stable and have a label and have some constancy to it and nabana is not that

80
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,200
so it usually gets described in terms of what it isn't it's not clinging

81
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,360
it's the ending of greed hatred and delusion so what's

82
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,760
what's being experienced when there's just nothing but clarity and no

83
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,640
resistance none it's for me kind of the way that I'm uh

84
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,640
imagining it especially in the context of this uh suta of the simile of the

85
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,720
raft there's a way in which we might imagine like a river or a creek or a stream this

86
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,200
flowing uh body of water how things just move and how sometimes like we can take

87
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,880
a bucket stick it in the water and say oh okay here's what this is what's in

88
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,000
here is the river and kind of not realizing like oh no

89
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,200
actually the river is this moving thing this is the same idea I was talking about with concepts there's this way in

90
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:03,920
which we scoop up some water And okay then we start working with this thinking that it's the river but it's not and the

91
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,560
non- delusion non greed non-hatred is the way in which we're creating this

92
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,920
scooper and we're doing the activity of scooping

93
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,959
and looking into it we could say that's one way we could this is greed hatred

94
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:26,480
and delusion is uh doing that this is really subtle and it's maybe doesn't

95
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:34,279
make any sense but maybe it does in some kind of way too this recognition of

96
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:42,640
wanting to solidify or raify or uh make something solid and permanent

97
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,320
and stable and something like that it's this really fundamental

98
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,399
uh deep maybe wish that we have because it's tied up with this idea of like okay

99
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,959
I just need a place where I can rest where everything is stable and happy and

100
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:07,519
clear i just I just I just haven't found it yet i just got to keep on looking i got to keep on looking oh it's not here

101
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:14,959
okay i got to keep on looking and we can spend our whole life looking for this place where oh I can finally rest and

102
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,720
where we've arrived and we never have to seek again

103
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,839
that doesn't exist and it turns out to not be a problem

104
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,680
that it doesn't exist it's the thinking that we need it that's

105
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:39,320
the problem not the absence of this final place to rest

106
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:48,240
so another way in which we might understand like freedom maybe more generally if not exactly nabana is uh

107
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:56,880
this absence of uh identifying with things this absence of

108
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,120
having experiences be all about me

109
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,880
like for example just like you know maybe sadness arises wave of sadness

110
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,079
and then there's the thought it's not uncommon for thought patterns to arise

111
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:24,399
oh I have to fix this I can't have this no this is not good I don't want this

112
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,839
there's a sense of oh this is a problem and I have to fix it or

113
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,680
um maybe something another way we can identify with it is oh my gosh this

114
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:45,600
sadness again i don't want to experience this again i you know I spent a decade so sad i I I I thought I was over it and

115
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:53,240
I got to do something different i've been trying to outrun this my whole life and here it is again

116
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,920
i'm not saying that any of the none of this isn't uh actual experiences

117
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,959
what I'm saying is the stories the narratives

118
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:14,639
that get attributed to an experience are extra

119
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:21,600
they don't need to be there it's just sadness it's just sadness

120
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,079
it doesn't have to be a problem it doesn't have to mean anything about us as a human doesn't have to mean anything

121
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,440
about us as a a failure or a success or

122
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,639
happy person or a sad person it doesn't mean anything

123
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,680
it's just sadness that's being experienced and it arises

124
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,839
and passes away this is a radical idea this is a radical

125
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,760
idea that uh things just are as they are they're being experienced the way

126
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:02,720
they're being experienced i'm not talking about uh passivity i'm

127
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,600
not talking about being uh half comedos or something like this

128
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,800
right where you just uh totally disconnected from experience

129
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:21,279
i'm talking about just recognize it feeling the fullness of life and like oh

130
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:28,560
here's this experience oh there here's another experience that one uh arose and let away oh here's another

131
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:35,519
one rose and uh passed away and just realizing that's actually what life is

132
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:42,160
and it's beautiful so I want to talk about some of the

133
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,079
ideas that we might have like unknowingly bringing to ideas of what the far shore

134
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:55,839
is or what freedom is and often when I'm talking about this in dharma talks I'm using the word peace ease and freedom be

135
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:03,360
and I'm using these words because I want everybody to be able to find what's meaningful for them maybe ease is really

136
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,399
what's meaningful for them or maybe peace is or maybe freedom or maybe different days it's different i I want

137
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,800
all of us to be able to find uh what's meaningful for us or be able to relate to this in a way that's meaningful

138
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:23,120
instead of saying oh it's about some thing that you don't understand or or

139
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,680
maybe doesn't you're not interested in

140
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,720
so here are some common ways and I know and I certainly

141
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:42,079
had all of these i I absolutely had because unknowingly

142
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,839
I did and I see this happening in a lot of people too in the absence of our

143
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,600
talking about what is freedom then people just fill in the blank of course

144
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:01,839
they do of course they do and what gets filled in the blank in terms of like okay well what is freedom really or or

145
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,279
is there yeah what is is there a big range of it is there just one type or

146
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,959
you know all this type of stuff what happens is that we often are failing in

147
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:20,720
the blank with what we want of course and what kind of the dominant culture

148
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,240
suggests is something that's the fruit of a spiritual practice or something

149
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,399
like this so these two kind of like inputs uh fill in the blank of what uh

150
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:39,480
nibbana or awakening or enlightenment might be

151
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,680
so one idea that we might have it's this

152
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,880
permanent state of equinimity we might say that there where nothing is

153
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,000
disturbing where there's no longer being agitated

154
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,400
or no longer feeling like a little bit triggered like oh that was a little bit

155
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,918
uncomfortable or you know like just being chilled out about everything all

156
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:16,319
the time maybe feeling completely unbothered or serene or completely

157
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:25,120
centered and never uh pushed uh off uh center even just a tiny bit

158
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:32,400
and this is very compelling because so much of our world feels turbulent

159
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,440
the outside world certainly feels turbulent the our inner world can feel

160
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:44,160
turbulent there can be a whole morass of stuff going on in there so of course we

161
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:52,240
have this idea that oh it's uh it's just going to be complete peacefulness all

162
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:59,919
the time complete calmness all the time and maybe I'll even add I mean we do

163
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,760
experience moments of calm and moments of peace when we're meditating and it

164
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:13,280
can feel like a certain liberation a liberation from the turbulence a liberation from the stress or the chaos

165
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,120
that uh we might be feeling this whatever degree of calmness or peace or

166
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:26,080
ease that we're experiencing so it must feel like oh okay awakening will be more of that

167
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,000
and in some ways it is but I'll talk a little bit more about uh that i first I

168
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,640
want to just um highlight some of the ways we might be thinking about it

169
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,760
and right that doesn't sound bad wouldn't it be nice to never be bothered

170
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,559
another uh way in which we might think about it is like have this complete

171
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,480
uh self-acceptance like fully embracing and loving and welcoming all aspects of

172
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,320
ourselves every part of ourself not having any bit of this uh inner

173
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,760
critic or any sense of shame or any sense of insecurity having like nothing

174
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:16,799
like that but instead feeling perfectly adequate and sufficient and as opposed

175
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:24,640
to being inadequate and insufficient sometimes like oh nope I'm perfectly fine as I am

176
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,600
that could be a way in which we imagine that uh uh a awakening is

177
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:40,400
and of course we bring this this idea because I mean this inner critic that so

178
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,160
much of us uh have is painful it's really and wrecks havoc in our lives in

179
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:53,200
so many ways and wouldn't it be great if it weren't there any longer

180
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,039
or maybe we have had some experiences during meditation when there has been

181
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:05,600
some warmth and some warm-heartedness for ourselves either that arose spontaneously or maybe it was something

182
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:13,760
that we cultivated with loving kindness practice or maybe just there are some states of uh samadei some states of a

183
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,880
collectedness unification that have that feeling like

184
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:26,400
this feeling of wholeness that uh with a flavor of um well-being

185
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,760
that that feels can feel like such a relief and it also can feel like

186
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,600
empowering like okay I I'm okay I I can meet

187
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,840
whatever needs to be met or I can take care of whatever needs to be taken care

188
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,880
of that's another way in which we might uh

189
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,559
think about awakening and again this is perfectly legitimate and of course we

190
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,600
have these ideas and there's this way in which it can be even helpful to have

191
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,600
these ideas or maybe another uh idea that we might

192
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,440
have is that uh I've heard this expression a unity consciousness

193
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,640
um I don't think you'll hear that very much here at Insight Meditation Center it's

194
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,520
not part of our tradition our lineage this idea of unity consciousness but

195
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,000
where the maybe the separation of self of of the notion between self and

196
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,440
everything that's not self dissolve these are meditative experiences uh they

197
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:42,640
can be known um this idea of being merged uh with

198
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,000
everything I know that um early in my meditation

199
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,039
practice wow Wow for a long time I felt like I didn't know what freedom was but

200
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,280
I'm sure it had to be crazy wild you know for me like the weirder the

201
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,039
meditative experience the better so I just felt like I had to cultivate weird

202
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:11,760
stuff just because I felt like it certainly couldn't be ordinary whatever it was and uh that turned out not to be

203
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,120
such a good idea i'm telling my teachers weird stuff and they're kind of looking at me like "Dana

204
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,559
what are you doing and I tell my friends and we would laugh

205
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:29,440
about it and talk about it." But yeah it turned out not to be such a good idea because I wasn't paying attention to

206
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,039
what was really important instead of maybe I had I had some

207
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:42,480
experience that I assigned a whole narrative and meaning to and you know all this extra stuff and it just turned

208
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:50,720
out to be like a culdeac it just like oh well h there's nothing to do with that

209
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,440
and so forth and then coming back to practice but I mean of course this idea of

210
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,720
wanting to have some transcendent or maybe you have had some experiences that

211
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:10,000
have felt like that or that felt uh um like maybe sacred or like the most true

212
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,360
or real thing that you've ever experienced or and maybe it's changed your life in some kind of way

213
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:24,000
it turns out this is not so uncommon people who start a meditation practice

214
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,480
not everybody some people have had a glimpse of something and maybe it's not

215
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:38,000
clear to them um in some setting in their lives maybe you're in the midst of a crisis in the

216
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,760
midst of uh using substances of uh some sort or in the midst of some other

217
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:53,600
tradition or sometimes just spontaneously and then they're trying to find a a way back to that and they're

218
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:00,159
using meditation as a a way back so this uh you know I'm using this expression

219
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:06,559
unity consciousness but it also can just be any kind of like non-ordinary state

220
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:15,000
that felt like oh this this is important and I need to get back there

221
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,000
yeah and the problem of course with this is that uh it just really highlights

222
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,039
that oh I'm here if we're always uh chasing something over there there's

223
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:34,159
always like am I there yet am I there oh no I'm here this is very subtle that

224
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:41,840
happens but it pretty much guarantees that you will not have that experience again which is to the great frustration

225
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,679
of everybody who tries or and then you're like I could go on

226
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:55,679
with this list right but maybe uh one more thing I'll say too is that maybe we have these ideas that um all our

227
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:04,080
relationships with everybody all our interactions with everybody with all beings will be healthy and mature and

228
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,880
that uh we'll communicate clearly all the time and we'll understand what everybody is saying very clearly and

229
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:18,400
there'll be this uh uh intimacy that feels appropriate and tender and uh

230
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:25,200
nourishing and some kind of way and that will happen like with all people all the time

231
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,039
of course we would like to have this because so often we feel separate we

232
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:38,400
feel alone we feel like maybe we don't understand other people we feel like other people don't understand us

233
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,919
of course we would want to have this of course we would want to live maybe

234
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,360
without this fear of rejection or a fear of abandonment but instead this

235
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:55,919
recognition that uh this recognition of a connection and a

236
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:02,278
understanding in some way with other people

237
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,760
so these are some of the ideas that we might have about the far shore they're

238
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:16,159
perfectly legitimate and it's quite a something how this practice

239
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:23,200
a mindfulness practice and maybe some um some concentration some samadei practice

240
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:29,120
and maybe a little bit of study can really help move along towards those

241
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,960
goals absolutely absolutely

242
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:42,080
but there's also this way that even the whole notion of a far shore can be a

243
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,600
trap just as I said because it makes you feel like it really highlights

244
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:54,080
oh I'm here i'm not there and then it's really subtle but often

245
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:01,200
what happens with that is like this is a problem i have to fix it i have to get over there i'm clearly I'm not doing

246
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,919
something right what am I not doing right or those people over there clearly they aren't doing something right

247
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:15,279
they're that's preventing me from doing this or something like that so that's one way

248
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:23,120
but it turns out that it's this isn't a journey of distance of

249
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:30,080
space it's a journey of perception or a shift

250
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,799
in our relationship to experiences

251
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,120
as opposed to having just the right experiences

252
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,799
the far shore isn't elsewhere it's not somewhere else it's what arises it's

253
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:56,960
what opens it's what's experienced when we stop struggling

254
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:03,440
to become to become

255
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,279
to be you know put ourselves in a little box i'm like this and these are my

256
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:15,360
qualities I have and you know to kind of like raify um ourselves it's it's what

257
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:23,919
arises when we let go and there is no clinging this really radical letting go

258
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:30,399
so it can be a trap because we are always looking over there but also what's implicit in that as I mentioned

259
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:36,960
earlier is that we're measuring we're using the erroneous metrics like oh I'm

260
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:44,799
not having all that complete experience that I really want therefore I must be doing something wrong meanwhile we're

261
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:52,840
not noticing those moments of ease and spaciousness

262
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:03,279
that are spontaneously arising maybe we're cultivating them and developing them but those moments of when there's

263
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,279
not a lot of sense of self or clinging

264
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:15,679
i remember this one time that um this was during a a retreat at a retreat

265
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,120
center where I was uh spending a lot of time sitting outside in nature it was

266
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,520
just lovely just to be outside and do my meditation outside and I would like sit

267
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,760
walk sit walk you know in this little area that I had found

268
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,200
and um I remember this one time I don't I was

269
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:46,240
doing sitting meditation i don't know remember what uh caused me to open my eyes but I remember opening my eyes and

270
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,279
I was sitting like up on a hill and I could see like a certain expanse like

271
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:57,120
you know down into the valley a little bit and just uh seeing this hawk i think

272
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,039
it was a hawk i don't know it was a big bird that one that doesn't flap its wings

273
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,320
and uh and it was just soaring

274
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,080
and going down and then up and maybe around in a circle and there was this

275
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,880
way that I felt like just this beautiful like oh I was soaring too and there was

276
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:27,120
it was like just the most beautiful experience of like I don't know this uh

277
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:34,559
sense of ease and spaciousness and like this

278
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:40,399
flight but sometimes you know even those types

279
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:47,279
of experiences or even minor ones when uh

280
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:53,760
I was um near a kind of like a river not too long

281
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,039
ago and this feeling of uh oh just to

282
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:04,399
like jump in i just felt like oh let's just jump in and then just allowing the

283
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:09,840
current to carry me it was just like you know this sense of ease and it was just

284
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,320
so much fun and uh spaciousness like nothing need to happen except it not to

285
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:24,159
run into something of course but just this these feelings of ease and spaciousness that arise whether they're

286
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,159
big things or small things if we're often thinking like oh no I have to have

287
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,200
perfect relationships or I have to um feel complete or I have to get rid of

288
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,279
any feeling of inadequacy or I have to do something or other then we will tend

289
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:48,640
like oh yeah that's nice but I'm still not there but it turns out that these

290
00:31:48,640 --> 00:32:00,080
moments are really what practice is about or maybe we are having some uh thoughts

291
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,320
about ourselves like ah you really should uh do the dishes before such and

292
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,679
such happens because if you don't do the dishes then

293
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:17,519
I don't know what would happen actually what if you I don't know we have this uh all these stories it's kind of hard for

294
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,120
me to make up stories when I'm uh in the sitting up here maybe at home in I don't

295
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,880
know so that was a story too right

296
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,480
but what one thing I wanted to say is that uh if we have this idea of what

297
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,720
freedom is then we might not notice those times in which thoughts arise and

298
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,960
we're like okay yeah whatever those are just thoughts and we don't pay any attention to them we don't make them

299
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,000
mean anything about ourselves we notice like okay that's a story and I mean it's

300
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,279
okay minds make stories you don't have to make them be a problem but there's times in which we often aren't noticing

301
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,640
how often we're not getting caught up with thoughts

302
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,080
because we think that awakening has to look a particular way and we're so we're being dismissive or just not even

303
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,120
noticing but the way towards more freedom is not getting caught up with

304
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:24,679
thoughts and this is happening we're just not noticing

305
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:32,399
so there's this way in which we can understand that I'll use this word awakening there's a lot that could be

306
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:38,480
said about this and there's also a lot that could not be said I guess one way

307
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,760
to think about it is that it is not a

308
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:50,960
constant state it's not a location certainly but it's

309
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:57,200
not this continuous bliss or peace or

310
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:05,760
something like that it's not fixed it can't be it's not fixed instead it's

311
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:12,320
um it's the it's not being pushed around by

312
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:21,679
the uh whatever the experience is so it's not um it's a radical uh shift

313
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:28,158
in our relationship to what's happening so maybe there's some irritation arises

314
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:35,040
and it's just irritation and it goes away and it lasts for a moment and it goes away

315
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,878
and it doesn't mean anything about the person it's just like oh okay irritation

316
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,320
happens when I have to stand in line in a long time

317
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,599
and I'm in a hurry i didn't give myself enough time and in a hurry and I have to stand in line at the grocery store or

318
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,118
you know something like that and the grocery clerk is talking and talking and talking to the person in front of us and

319
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:03,040
they're going on and on and on or something like this right so it's not like it's just like a moment of

320
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,680
frustration arises and it's okay

321
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,560
so it's this this non- clinging this unbinding

322
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,800
this uh it's the this radical letting go

323
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,920
it's maybe like anger arises and then it just

324
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:33,359
arises and passes away there's no rumination about it like I can't believe did you that person cut me off and where

325
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:39,200
did they learn how to drive and don't they know what they're doing and don't they know who I am and you know all this

326
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:46,880
kind of stuff it's just oh there's a little maybe something of some anger and there's no

327
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:54,599
resentment there's no residual there's no rumination it's just something that arises

328
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:01,119
it turns out that this is what freedom really is it's not being a bliss blob

329
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:07,599
instead it's like mental events are still occurring but the relationship is to them is

330
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,880
different there isn't any identification we're not adding anything

331
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,880
there isn't any adding of what it means about me as a person about the world in

332
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,559
general it's just an experience

333
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:32,560
so it's not about maybe what is happening and it's not that we're in constant bliss it's more that everything

334
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,760
is it's how it's being Yeah that's not even

335
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,680
quite right um how it's being experienced or or their

336
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:51,200
relationship to them it's a it's not a permanent feeling it's

337
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:59,520
a lack of adding anything extra

338
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,040
to experience and then it turns out that adding things

339
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,720
extra is where uncomfortableness is where dooka arises

340
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,480
is from all this stuff extra that we add and part of meditation as the mind

341
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:23,599
starts to get quieter and quieter we start to see the more subtle ways in which we're adding things that are extra

342
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:30,599
on this i can imagine this is not very satisfying to hear about

343
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,359
but maybe there's this way we can understand it uh like maybe there's just like greater

344
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:45,280
flexibility that um there's a disappointment that arises like oh okay

345
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,720
I thought this was I was going to do this today or I was going to meet this person today but oh that's not going to

346
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:58,160
happen oh okay and then just pivot and do the next thing instead of you know any heaviness about it like oh I can't

347
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:04,800
believe that they changed at the last minute or I rearranged my schedule to in order to accommodate them or you know

348
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:12,160
something like this something like this or maybe there's a the reactivity is

349
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:20,000
just uh maybe there isn't this uh bursting

350
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,480
or responding instead of like "Oh wow okay that was uncomfortable."

351
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,960
Some interaction with somebody and it's just an uncomfortable experience that

352
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,240
arises and passes away

353
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:47,119
so what if the far shore is not like something over there to reach what if

354
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,920
it's you know not over there but what if it's what remains

355
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:01,839
when we stop seeking when we stop always looking for

356
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:08,320
something to be different or something to you know match our ideas of

357
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,760
what freedom is like it's an interesting thing because as

358
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,720
long as there's seeking by definition there is not finding

359
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:26,640
and yet we are so used to seeking seeking seeking what happens if we just put down the

360
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:37,359
seeking and then finding happens this turns out to be pretty powerful

361
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:44,960
so all the subtle ways in which we are seeking Or what if the far side is not like on

362
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,280
the other side of that great expanse of water but it's on the other side of

363
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,520
clinging it's on the other side like seeking

364
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,520
clinging we can use different words for this uh the way in which

365
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,599
we're adding things that are extra to our experiences

366
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:16,800
so maybe you can just be sensitive to or open to when do you taste moments of

367
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,920
non-grasping non seeking

368
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,119
non clinging when are they being experienced

369
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,560
chances are they're happening and meditation practice just allows it

370
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,920
to be noticed and for it to happen more and more and

371
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,720
or what happens when you're not trying to fix or protect or defend your sense

372
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,400
of self or bolster your sense of self what what hope is there something that

373
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,599
opens up when you are no longer defending the self or

374
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:01,119
protecting or bolstering when that whole self project relaxes

375
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,680
and then what opens what's available

376
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,400
and can you rest there

377
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:19,839
even for just a portion of a breath

378
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:25,319
one second less than a second

379
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:34,160
this is what's being pointed to is the far shore and this metaphor is you know fun or

380
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:40,480
helpful to talk about but it also can help feed this trap that uh the far

381
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,240
shore is over there somewhere

382
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:56,079
so I'll stop there and open it up to see if there's some comments or questions

383
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:02,079
thank you i didn't leave a lot of time for

384
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,560
questions here

385
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,920
jim I think Jamie has a question

386
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:34,160
uh your description of unity consciousness I think is the best

387
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,839
description I've heard of something that happened to me first spontaneously when

388
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:47,119
I was about 11 years old and uh maybe a couple times since then and um I've told

389
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:54,000
teachers about it and they haven't been really uh impressed by

390
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,079
or they they they've said things like "Well was that nice for you?" And I said

391
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:07,839
"Yes." But um yeah it's it is a it feels like a

392
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:14,720
transcendent experience but it's um I guess I haven't really experienced that

393
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:22,400
leading me on to um I'm sorry you hadn't experienced I hadn't experienced it a feeling of that

394
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:29,440
it was sort of leading me towards anything deeper maybe

395
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,560
so just a comment I guess it feels kind of cruel right when we

396
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,160
have experiences that are really meaningful and yet they feel uh uh

397
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,400
evasive and we can't have them again and yeah it's it's kind of a cruel thing

398
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,400
i'll just speak from my own experience and feeling like wait what what you know like I don't know if like and what am I

399
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,680
doing wrong and you know all this stuff gets added on top of it i don't know if that was the case for you but definitely

400
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:03,720
for me so thank you

401
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:18,079
um I'm reminded when you talked about uh extra um it helped solidify

402
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:23,599
u in my mind the the idea comp in in

403
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:30,319
addition to last recently here someone was talking about um

404
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:38,240
the the the dharma was a talk a part of partly about um someone that felt in a

405
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,599
moment like they had messed up and had omitted something that should have been

406
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:51,040
included and winced and went up to the teacher at the end and apologized and

407
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:58,400
the teacher's response was mistakes happen the wincing was extra and that helped me

408
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:05,640
realize what that was about so thank you yeah you're welcome you're welcome

409
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:15,040
okay so here we are at uh 8:30 so thank you for your attention i wish you a

410
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:21,119
wonderful rest of the evening and safe travels home thank you

411
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:27,800
if you'd like you're welcome to come up here and talk to me ask a question
