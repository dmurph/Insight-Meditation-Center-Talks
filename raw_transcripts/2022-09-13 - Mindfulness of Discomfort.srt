1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,460
uh good evening everyone welcome

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,540
uh several weeks ago Diana Clark asked me if I would give a talk tonight I she's

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:21,119
away and at the time that she asked me I was

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,480
working in South Korea and hadn't been attending IMC

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,040
since I think early June uh or early July

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,940
and I was somewhat out of a loss of what to talk about

7
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:50,160
um so I decided that I would talk about

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:58,079
sort of how I Spent My Summer Vacation I worked for NASA

9
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,960
and in that capacity I

10
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,000
um have a an instrument that flies on high

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,080
altitude aircraft for measuring atmospheric gases and so for the last several years I've

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,720
been preparing to get that ready to to go to uh on this aircraft than in into

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,280
Korea and it required that I go to Houston Texas

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,579
in late June and early July of this of this year and I knew that it would be hot and

15
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:43,740
humid but it was record-breaking hot and humid they had more days over a hundred

16
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,720
than they'd ever had before and so

17
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,540
I had to deal with just the the discomfort

18
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:04,979
of being in hot humid um

19
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,560
uncomfortable environment for generally speaking short periods of time

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,680
just between the building that I was working in and the my car or between my

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,800
car and a restaurant or the restaurant and or the hotel and the car

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,900
and I realized I didn't think about it too much but mostly my my way of working

23
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:35,459
with that discomfort was sort of a a stoic endurance of it

24
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,840
you know just kind of

25
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:47,760
not kind of tuning it out in a certain way or

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:55,739
um hardened hardening myself in a way to that experience

27
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,920
and I was really looking forward to to leaving it and going to South Korea

28
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,360
which I thought would be much more Pleasant

29
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:17,040
and so I was working at a Osan Air Base outside of Seoul

30
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,860
and I couldn't have been more wrong Soul had it's the hottest temperatures

31
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:30,959
that it had ever in addition to having floods and our

32
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,879
typhoon and all sorts of other challenging conditions

33
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,159
and on this base I didn't have a car I

34
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,379
didn't there there were taxis all over that kind of hard to get hold of at

35
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:57,720
certain times so it required walking through the heat for is about a mile from where I was the

36
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,080
lodge that I was in to the flight line where I was working

37
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,459
and all of the places to get food were about

38
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:14,040
almost the same distance they were about three quarters of a mile from the flight line

39
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,979
so in some ways I was forced to walk

40
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:28,919
in hot humid conditions bright Sun absolutely no wind

41
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:34,139
uh and I found that I I started out with

42
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:39,960
that same sort of stoic endurance strategy

43
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:46,199
and it turned out it just was it was miserable it just didn't work

44
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,900
and then it dawned on me oh I know I know how to work with this I'll

45
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:59,820
do mindfulness meditation and this is something that I've been doing now for multiple decades

46
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,280
but for some reason it hadn't really occurred to me to to apply it in this

47
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,960
situation um

48
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:19,440
so I made a kind of a modified version of uh walking meditation

49
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,680
and I'm curious how many of you have had some kind of training in Walking

50
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:33,479
meditation okay some of you had and so you know that

51
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:39,060
um you know it's mostly paying attention to the sensations in your feet or in your

52
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,820
lower legs as you um

53
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:50,880
lift one foot move it place it lift the other foot move it and place it

54
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,479
foreign I decided I would try I wonder if I

55
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:04,259
wonder if this will really work under this kind of extreme condition at least it was extreme for me I'm sure that

56
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:10,460
there are people who have lived in uh even more challenging

57
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:16,400
conditions than that but for me it was um

58
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,320
not a common experience for me

59
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,940
so in the teravadan Buddhist tradition there's a teaching about how to do

60
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,160
mindfulness meditation formally

61
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,340
which is based on the four foundations of mindfulness

62
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:46,319
so these four foundations of mindfulness the the First Foundation is mindfulness

63
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:53,280
of the body and that's perhaps straightforward to think about you know it's like

64
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,380
paying attention to the sensations that occur in the body

65
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,900
moment to moment so in in addition to paying attention to

66
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,960
the feet and paying attention to the legs

67
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,319
uh I could pay attention to the entire body in particular the skin

68
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,500
and all of the perspiration that was coming up from the Heat and the humidity

69
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:27,840
uh The Sensation from the clothing that was getting rapidly getting very wet

70
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,240
from sweating um

71
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,340
I was walking about three to five miles a day which is more than I typically do

72
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:46,880
and so I was noticing the sensations of soreness of the muscles

73
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,780
um I was carrying about a 30 pound computer bag so there was you know the sensations

74
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,520
in the shoulder and the arm

75
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:05,639
uh I was having some back issues so there were Sensations in the back

76
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:12,440
uh all of those kind of Sensations are included in the category of

77
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,979
mindfulness of the body

78
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:25,259
and so and what made it somewhat easier to do was

79
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:31,740
that those Sensations were pretty predominant they weren't subtle at all

80
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:39,240
so I didn't have to you know kind of really try hard to notice what was going

81
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,720
on with the body uh the second Foundation of mindfulness

82
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,360
is mindfulness of uh feeling tone sometimes called vedana

83
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,180
it's like is the Sensation that you're experiencing is it Pleasant

84
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,700
is it unpleasant or is it neither Pleasant nor unpleasant

85
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,959
is it kind of a neutral have a neutral feeling tone to it

86
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,560
and again yeah well and it's that can be a very

87
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,380
important thing to pay attention to because often

88
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:30,060
were unconsciously driven to seek out that which is pleasant and to

89
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:37,560
try to avoid or push away that which is unpleasant and kind of ignore what's neutral what's

90
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:44,300
kind of neither Pleasant or nonpleasant we just don't pay attention to it

91
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:49,740
so uh so vedana of the feeling tone is the

92
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:55,860
second Foundation the third Foundation of mindfulness practice

93
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,320
is mindfulness of Mind States like what

94
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,660
what is the state of the mind is it

95
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:13,080
open or is it contracted um

96
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,279
you know is it is it sort of friendly or is it hostile

97
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:27,620
um is a curious or is it contracted

98
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:34,620
there's some formal names for the different uh mine States but I kind of make them up for my myself like kind of

99
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:41,360
noticing what what states of mine tend do I tend to experience

100
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:49,260
and there's a differentiation between mind States the third Foundation of

101
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:57,860
mindfulness and mind objects or mental formations thoughts

102
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,560
in that the mind States tend to be things that

103
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,640
last longer you know if if a certain mind state is

104
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:16,500
developed it may be around for a while whereas mental formations thoughts tend

105
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,260
to just kind of come and go fairly rapidly so

106
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:27,660
uh here's the paying attention to mind

107
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,820
States and then the fourth Foundation is

108
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:42,779
mindfulness of uh mind objects or mental formations uh thoughts you could say

109
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:47,880
um what kind of things are going on in the mind you know what kind of stories what

110
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,040
kind of opinions what kind of beliefs

111
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:02,040
um you know all of those things that can

112
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:09,120
occur so those are the four foundations so of

113
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,339
mindfulness so for this particular situation where I

114
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:22,680
decided I was really going instead of trying to mentally avoid paying attention to the

115
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:29,160
discomfort this discomfortable this com uncomfortable

116
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,519
um experience of Walking In The Heat I decided that I would really

117
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:42,260
Let It Be an opportunity for me to just practice developing

118
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:48,420
mindfulness the muscle of mindfulness the muscle of being able to be actively

119
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:58,040
aware of what's going on and see what happens you know does is that

120
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:05,959
uh does that uh help in some way or not

121
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,680
and so

122
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:19,320
uh you know as I was saying earlier that you know mindfulness of the body was was pretty obvious

123
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:26,399
um you know that I'd pay attention not only

124
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:34,860
to the to the Heat into the sweating into the soreness

125
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:41,519
um but there were some Sensations that um were more subtle like just the the

126
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:48,300
feeling of the feet on the ground um and some that were even

127
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:54,360
mildly Pleasant given that um

128
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,540
I would often be kind of soaked in sweat any little breeze any little air motion

129
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:09,899
any little um uh walking into the shade temporarily

130
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:15,959
had a um had a pleasant feeling tone to it you

131
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:22,560
know it was was noticeable I could feel oh yeah that was good uh

132
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,380
occasionally on the way back to my uh lodging I would stop at this mall this

133
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,320
food court which was air-conditioned walking into the air conditioning was

134
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,740
really noticeable and it was really really Pleasant

135
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,959
at least at the beginning um [Applause]

136
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:51,360
and so over time you know so so mindfulness of the body

137
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,100
was a very um

138
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,740
I'll say easy practice not that I liked it but that it didn't

139
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:08,040
require um a lot of energy or effort to be to be

140
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:16,139
aware of the body similarly with feeling tone you know

141
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:23,279
similarly with the the pleasant the unpleasant and the

142
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,399
neutral for for many of the experiences that I

143
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:35,100
was having a lot many of the uh physical Sensations and also mental

144
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,920
activity um

145
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,360
I could notice I think I I tended to notice most

146
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,220
predominantly what was unpleasant you know that was that was really

147
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,399
stood out

148
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,100
and then the third Foundation mindfulness of Mind States

149
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:17,760
I could I could tell those times when

150
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:25,980
there was strong aversion that was a very aversive mind was often set by the conditions

151
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,320
that I had experienced that day like did I get enough sleep

152
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:37,040
or was I rested or was I tired um

153
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,519
was I hungry or was I pretty well fed

154
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,560
uh had I had a lot of success that day or not

155
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,079
had the instrument worked well had we solved some problems

156
00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:01,160
or had we found new problems and you know

157
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:07,220
so success and failure would often influence how

158
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,480
what the state of mind was that I was experiencing

159
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,819
was I thirsty I have to say

160
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:26,459
um I was very tuned into the fact that

161
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:32,419
being out in the heat had a certain danger to it

162
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:40,080
you know that that it is possible to get dehydrated to have a heat exhaustion or

163
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,320
heat stroke in fact there was a chemistry professor from Berkeley

164
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:53,039
that I knew who had died of heat exhaustion while taking a

165
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,500
short walk in Utah just a few weeks before I went to South Korea

166
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:04,799
so I realized that these these things can sneak up on you

167
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:11,039
so I was very aware of of drinking you know at least two to three liters of

168
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:17,480
water a day so I didn't often get

169
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:25,200
anywhere near dehydrated but I would get I'd certainly get tired I would

170
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:32,760
certainly get hungry um there were other

171
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,100
times when I just get frustrated and so

172
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,740
I'd see how how the

173
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:51,440
um what was what was the state of my mind as I was walking

174
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,580
and then finally the the fourth Foundation is mindfulness of of I'll say

175
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:05,840
thoughts mental processes mental formations

176
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,640
when I first when it first occurred to me to do mindfulness

177
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,580
as a way of meeting the discomfort that I was

178
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:24,059
feeling um I had a lot of strong thoughts

179
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:30,720
I I hated this experience I just really I just really hated it

180
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,440
um I you know had thoughts that this shouldn't be happening it shouldn't be

181
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:44,820
happening to me somebody needs to take care of me you know somebody's needs to be chauffeuring

182
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,299
me around so that I don't have to experience this uh

183
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:56,880
self-judgment about why am I suffering and all these other people are just walking around as though

184
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,940
you know everything's fine

185
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:12,179
um and so it really was those thoughts of

186
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:17,659
of hatred that caught my attention

187
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:26,160
and made me think hey there I must find a better way

188
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:34,340
to deal with the the discomfort of the Heat then just some kind of

189
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,860
uh you know stoically enduring it

190
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:48,240
and it occurred to me that in the teachings of the Buddha he talked there's there's

191
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,820
a story about the Buddha asking one of his monks

192
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:59,580
he's um oh paraphrase the story but it it goes

193
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:07,740
he asked the monkey if you get hit by an arrow somebody shoots an arrow and it sticks into you does that hurt

194
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:13,140
and the monk said yes you know yes uh

195
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:20,280
yes Buddha that that would hurt and he said and if somebody were to shoot a second Arrow

196
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:26,820
into you would that hurt even more and he said oh yeah yeah that second

197
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,220
Arrow would you know that that would also hurt

198
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:39,360
and so the the point of the story is that there are

199
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:46,220
some things that happen to us being in hot uncomfortable

200
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:52,700
conditions is like the first Arrow it's that part's unavoidable

201
00:21:54,179 --> 00:22:01,559
the second arrow is everything that we add to our experience all of the thoughts about it

202
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:07,500
all of the um either wanting it or or clinging to it

203
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,919
or trying to push it away or ignore it

204
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:21,799
all of the all of the ways that we relate to that first Arrow are really the second Arrow

205
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:28,799
and so I could see that well there was no avoiding the first

206
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:35,820
Arrow of of the Heat I could avoid the second

207
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,220
and third and fourth arrows that uh were my responsibility

208
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:46,460
you know that that I was

209
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:55,340
that I was choosing in a certain way by Choosing by not paying attention

210
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,700
yeah and so

211
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:17,820
I found that over time as I started to do this mindfulness as I would walk

212
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:24,240
out in the midday Heat that

213
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,179
it wasn't it was better I certainly I never reached the point

214
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:35,460
that I liked it that I found it an enjoyable experience

215
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:41,299
but I wasn't hating it I wasn't pushing it away I wasn't

216
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,440
I wasn't um fighting with it there was a certain level of acceptance that I was accepting

217
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:56,220
this is this is this is how this is what this moment is like

218
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,559
and that was quite a change

219
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:10,980
and that was just about the time that Diana asked me if if I would give a talk and

220
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:16,639
so I decided that I would look into this a little bit more

221
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:23,280
and about the week before I left Korea I saw that Eugene cash was giving a talk

222
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,880
up in San Francisco at San Francisco inside

223
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,260
and his talk was about loving

224
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:44,539
in the present moment loving whatever experience you're having even if you don't like it

225
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:51,960
and it was an inspiring talk I didn't

226
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,000
really think that that I would get to the point of loving the

227
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,980
experience and that's sort of a can often be a loaded word

228
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:11,159
but there were other things that I I could do I could find a level of acceptance

229
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:18,020
you know this this is this is this is what my present moment experience is like

230
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:27,500
by turning my attention to rather than away from the discomfort

231
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:35,640
there came to be a certain um a certain intimacy with the experience

232
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:42,240
that it wasn't it wasn't um you know kind of like

233
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:49,380
looking aside and wondering is it going away yet but really just welcoming it in

234
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:54,020
a certain way um

235
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:06,679
and so it was helpful then to hear uh Eugene talking about

236
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:13,140
the just how precious the present moment is

237
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:20,580
whatever it is you know whether it's whether it's uh comfortable or

238
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:25,519
uncomfortable joyous or sad

239
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,860
um

240
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,240
connected or lonely

241
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:44,220
um there aren't any moments that we have to that we have to reject

242
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:51,000
that we have to push away that we have to turn from that we can have this intimacy

243
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,020
with our experience and that was

244
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:06,140
you know that was part of the lesson for me in in being in Korea

245
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,140
when I got back I listened to a talk yesterday morning by a Tibetan teacher

246
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,840
Anam tubetin up in Point Richmond

247
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:25,279
and he was speaking about a very similar um

248
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,299
principal in Tibetan Buddhism about

249
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:37,260
cultivating within yourself a place of luminous awareness

250
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:43,520
a place I'll say a place it's it's

251
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:53,100
well who knows maybe it is a place inside that can be aware of what's going on

252
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,799
and unperturbed by what the content of the present moment is

253
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:04,020
so it can be aware of discomfort it can

254
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:10,860
be aware of longing it can be aware of joy

255
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:16,080
it can be aware of brightness

256
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,799
you know energetic brightness it can be aware of dullness

257
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,779
um and that

258
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:32,840
that place of luminous awareness

259
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,980
is sort it's it's up to us to

260
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:43,260
um create in a certain way or maybe find

261
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,340
or strengthen

262
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:54,240
so I think this this mindfulness of

263
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,460
mindfulness of heat meditation that I was doing for

264
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:07,220
oh I think it was about a month in Korea got me on that path got me more

265
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,480
motivated to to see is it possible for

266
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,580
me to reside more often in this place of

267
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:27,960
luminous awareness and not so much in the reaction to the my experience or the

268
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,860
um the thoughts about or the opinions about

269
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,080
so I felt very um I felt grateful in a way that I first

270
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,659
of all that I've been exposed to this practice for so many years

271
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:53,659
that it's kind of sinking in

272
00:29:54,059 --> 00:30:00,720
and towards the end of my time in Korea the

273
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:08,360
the temperature is actually cool down a bit down to even even below 80 at times

274
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:15,899
um and so I thought well this is a valuable lesson I'll put this one I'll put this one in the can and I'll I'll bring it

275
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:21,600
out when I need it again and of course I got back to the you I got back to

276
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,720
California last Wednesday in the midst of a record Heat Wave here and so I

277
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,820
realized okay well I guess this isn't just something that's now occurred and

278
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:38,898
is you know it's a great story and I can tell it but it was like okay

279
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:44,700
you're not Beyond discomfort you know the discomfort's gonna always be present

280
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,740
no matter where you are geographically

281
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:59,059
um yeah so

282
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,140
and it isn't a practice that's just about being hot or just the discomfort

283
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:13,500
of um the kind of the conditions we've all have been experiencing in the last week

284
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:19,919
or two uh I'm sure in a few months I'll be I could probably give a talk about

285
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:26,700
um cold meditation you know I think it's going to get cold this winter

286
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:33,360
it always has and if it's not that there's

287
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,760
um there's all of the aches and pains that

288
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:44,820
come with getting old so um

289
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:52,260
so working with discomfort is a pretty important part of life

290
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:58,140
you know like letting the discomfort be a teacher

291
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:03,299
um rather than just something that needs to be avoided or

292
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:09,480
um pushed away is an important

293
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,120
um important lesson for me

294
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:24,539
yeah so that's that's what I have to offer tonight

295
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:32,100
and we have a fair amount of time left if there's anyone that has any questions or comments or

296
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:37,260
uh would like to talk about experience they've had either dealing with heat or

297
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:43,140
dealing with any other kind of discomfort or anything else

298
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,760
so thank you

299
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:00,299
oh and if you do have a question I think there's a microphone so that people

300
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:03,440
online can hear

301
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:15,620
oh

302
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,740
okay oh thank you I just wanted to say thank you for the part where you said let the

303
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:31,019
discomfort be the teacher because I do often want to avoid discomfort and I'm

304
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:36,059
currently experiencing discomfort to the point

305
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:42,360
where I'm like can I handle this for an entire school year I don't know but

306
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:49,559
i instead of just thinking well I I mean I'm gonna be

307
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:56,519
I'm gonna be with these kids let me let me learn from them and let me not just

308
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:02,580
uh because boy it's a hard class and I just

309
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:08,339
there are times I just don't know what to do the end but as you said just I've

310
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:14,099
been resisting it a lot and I just just thank you I maybe treat

311
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:20,280
it as a let me learn from them you know because I was often very like

312
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,378
the self-judgment thinking why should I have to deal with this well I'm I'm

313
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:32,820
above this or I've been doing this for almost a decade now I can I can deal with it or why does it have to be this

314
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:39,118
hard again after the pandemic but no there's going to be discomfort at

315
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,740
every point in life and I need to be or I'm just being that having that luminous

316
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:51,060
mindfulness Within at least what I'm trying to cultivate is

317
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:57,540
something that I'm trying to strive for every day so just thanks

318
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:04,859
thank you for sharing that yeah one thing that it didn't say that in

319
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:10,260
addition to just being aware a strengthened awareness

320
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:16,680
that I found that over time there was a certain compassion that arose

321
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:24,540
in me compassion for myself caring about the experience

322
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:30,720
and wanting to do something so it isn't just a practice about

323
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,359
observing but there's also can be a much wiser

324
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:43,619
response the way we respond to our our experience can be

325
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:49,579
wiser if we're more connected with it so

326
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:57,839
hopefully you'll find some wise ways to work with your pain

327
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,140
thank you

328
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,820
the other side thank you

329
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:25,320
yeah something that when you were just speaking now about stoicism makes me

330
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:33,200
curious about myself because that's often my experience to adversity

331
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,680
and I'm not sure

332
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:52,320
but what you also said I think following that was like being Mary I'll paraphrase but like the

333
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:59,000
you can respond with some wisdom with uh

334
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:06,660
really being present to whatever is there also feels true like the stoicism is

335
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:14,880
kind of a coping mechanism but it's not as accurate so

336
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:23,540
it feels like something for me to sit with more maybe an egg sorry face adversity so

337
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:32,460
yeah I think it's when I I when I say kind of stoic and endurance

338
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:39,920
it's more like kind of white knuckling yeah you know it's like you know just

339
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:46,920
bearing down and and um you know trying to

340
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:55,339
you know kind of use the force of will to get through the experience rather than really allowing

341
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:03,839
and I I suspect that there's probably more years than I'd like to think of

342
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:11,220
where I've sat on a cushion in pain thinking that somehow if I if I

343
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:16,440
experience enough pain I'm going to have some you know transformational

344
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:23,940
experience but the pain alone didn't really do it it it's really how one relates to it

345
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:29,480
that's and and how one is relating to it that's

346
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,280
perhaps the the more important part

347
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,380
thank you yeah thank you

348
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,220
foreign

349
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:17,599
well I think that uh we can

350
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,619
end at this point I'll be around for a few minutes if

351
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:29,280
anyone has a specific question they want to bring to me personally

352
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:36,180
so thank you all for coming and uh may you be

353
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:41,339
um skillfully

354
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:46,369
uncomfortable [Laughter]
