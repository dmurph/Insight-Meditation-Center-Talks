1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,480
good morning

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,120
so one of the interesting or very important areas for

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,520
meditation and the deepening of meditation or as i like sometimes i think the filling out

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,560
of meditation i like the word filling out because the

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,599
idea of including all of ourselves going deep sometimes is kind of

6
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,440
bypassing can be bypassing or putting aside things but

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,960
filling out that some of the language of

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,000
meditation is things language are like being settled and settling all of who we

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,039
are or becoming composed or unified

10
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,719
so compose composing ourselves so all of who we are is here in a certain kind of

11
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,920
balance or harmony or uni unit unity unification

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,920
and that's difficult to do if we prioritize certain parts of our life

13
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,439
over other parts sometimes we prioritize our thinking

14
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,560
and then we get focused on on

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,040
you know focus on the thoughts and ideas and we lose touch with our body and the present the present moment

16
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,640
sometimes we uh prioritize our emotions and uh and everything is seen through

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,240
our emotions or by our emotions or felt in the emotional realm

18
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,240
and um and sometimes we can prioritize the body

19
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,840
and in buddhism buddhist ancient buddhist practice the body seems to have been a huge

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,960
priority but not as the expense of these other areas of our life

21
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,960
but it's the beginning place of of filling out

22
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,000
of being inclusive of of not getting stuck

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,080
in the places we usually get stuck in uh prior where we get stuck prioritizing

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:20,160
and one way to prioritize is we identify with it it becomes the kind of the location in which we live

25
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,200
we live in our thoughts we live in our emotions and as soon as we do that we're living in a partial way

26
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,920
through mindfulness of the body there's a way in which we we learn how to be inclusive of it all

27
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,319
where in a sense the body can hold the emotions the body can hold the the thoughts

28
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,599
but even more than the body it's the fluidity

29
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,400
of experience it's the softness of experience of awareness

30
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,879
in a sense we begin living in awareness where things are soft and open and

31
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:06,080
inclusive composed unified and one of the ways of doing that is to

32
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,480
be centered in the body so we'll start that way and i'll

33
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,680
try to guide you through a little bit experience or sense of this being composed settled

34
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,120
unified as a means for being calm

35
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,280
so to gently close your eyes

36
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:40,080
and without much else become aware of your body whatever way your body is now

37
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:47,040
maybe without even fixing it or relaxing just take a few moments to feel

38
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,519
how it actually is now as if you're doing so for the first time

39
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:01,840
like meeting a new person and you're just present and taking them in

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,040
and then gently there's a way of including your

41
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,040
body more of your body take a few a deep breath

42
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,560
where you feel the expansion of the torso widely globally

43
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,880
and doing that a few times and then with the exhale also

44
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,360
globally settling into this body

45
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,960
gathering the body together as you exhale

46
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,840
deep breath in and then on the exhale relaxing the body

47
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,400
and then to let your breathing return to normal

48
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,199
and then continuing to experience your body globally as you

49
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,199
breathe

50
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,039
as you inhale feel the body globally

51
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,440
as you exhale let your body settle relax

52
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,240
wherever there's tightness and wholeness holding

53
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,600
so

54
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:27,199
and then settling into just the experience of the body breathing

55
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:38,800
but for now as your body is breathing imagine the body is like a

56
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:47,840
like a balloon filled with water a water bed perhaps it

57
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,080
when you it's just this fluid and the whole

58
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,639
balloon moves with the water jostling around some someone touches it and the whole thing

59
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,680
kind of moves and this flu is fluid

60
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:16,039
so as you experience your body breathing the movements of the body

61
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,880
feel the fluidity of them as if they're water moving

62
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,160
moving water nope in a bag or water bed

63
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,879
and feel how that movement and fluidity

64
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:52,120
it's kind of a global experience in your body in whatever way that's easy for you

65
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,599
with a settling as you exhale a settling of the water

66
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,638
and the body has a rhythm of expanding and settling

67
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,080
and then rather than prioritizing your body or your thoughts or your

68
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,240
feelings prioritize the fluidity of the movements

69
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,760
in your body and letting the awareness surf on them

70
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,759
or float on them

71
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,440
whatever feelings you have in your body pleasant or unpleasant whatever emotions

72
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:53,600
you have let them all be included within

73
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,880
the rhythm of the body's fluidity movement

74
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,880
changing

75
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,560
relax into the movement

76
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:23,399
it could be very very subtle pulsing and vibrating

77
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,320
whatever distracted mind there is as you exhale

78
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:59,240
let it relax into the gentle movements of the body

79
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,600
so

80
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:45,759
and as if awareness is floating on the sensations that arise and pass

81
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:55,720
sensations which may be the fluidity of the sensations in the body that come and go

82
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:06,120
an awareness that holds it all floats on it all

83
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,880
and what are you prioritizing where are you living at the awareness

84
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:29,720
your thinking your emotions a particular concern of the body

85
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,880
can you relax the prioritization to open awareness up

86
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:50,480
to open the body up everything is

87
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,839
included in a kind of openness

88
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,240
that's fluid

89
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:56,879
and with a global awareness

90
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,680
let it all be present

91
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:11,399
but let all of it be centered on the experience of breathing

92
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,839
as if the movement begins and ends

93
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,480
with breathing

94
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,800
as if breathing is the heartbeat

95
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,920
of the global experience

96
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,279
that doesn't prioritize anything

97
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,279
includes everything

98
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,120
while being centered on breathing

99
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,080
on the exhale relaxing back into the place where breathing

100
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,080
begins

101
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,799
and if you feel any calm or tranquility

102
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:35,200
perhaps you can feel it perhaps you can feel the movements of

103
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:43,480
breathing moving out through that calmness

104
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:53,360
coming and going through it with a kind of like your

105
00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:00,360
forest bathing in your own calmness

106
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,400
as if you're being nourished nurtured

107
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,480
in a broad inclusive

108
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,120
calmness

109
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:38,760
that everything occurs within

110
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,000
being settled on oneself

111
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:36,159
can be calming calmness can be a way to settle on

112
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:43,120
oneself to be subtle here

113
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,480
in the present moment

114
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:55,440
and it can be this can be a gift that we bring with us into the world

115
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:02,480
the ability to be calm and settled with what we're doing

116
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,720
calm and settled in our conversations with others

117
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,840
not rushing on multitasking

118
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,200
but offering the gift of presence to another person

119
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,960
we can do this with our work and our activities and our driving whatever we're doing

120
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,159
we provide the gift with our settled calm attention

121
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:42,880
so we're really here for this life here for our experience

122
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,480
here for what's around us

123
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,640
and it has an impact others will feel it

124
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,559
the world will feel it in the ways

125
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:18,880
as we meditate as we come to appreciate the treasure of calmed settled attention

126
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,120
may we learn how to bring that into the world

127
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:31,840
to bring some of the best qualities of human beings with it

128
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,200
generosity and love and care [Music] wisdom

129
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:48,200
that thrive in settled calm attention

130
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,120
may this practice be for the welfare and happiness of everyone

131
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,679
may all beings be happy

132
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,120
may all beings be safe

133
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,039
may all beings be peaceful

134
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:21,320
and may all beings everywhere be free

135
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,840
so continuing with this theme of the week which is calmness

136
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:55,200
one of the words for calmness or tranquility is some mata

137
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,559
and uh it's s-a-m-a-t-h-a and it's um

138
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:07,279
often enough in english translated as serenity and it's seen as the partner of

139
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:12,720
vipassana and vipassana is insight so the inside practice

140
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,279
is partnered with a certain kind of serenity or calmness

141
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:26,720
that gives power or strength or clarity to the insight

142
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,278
and this samatha this kind of serenity is

143
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:40,080
associated with concentration and concentration is considered to be one of

144
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,640
the means of getting becoming calm and so concentration is

145
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:54,559
samadhi is is a process of becoming composed

146
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,840
or unified on our experience and i like to think of it as

147
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:06,159
begin with learning how to be centered in our experience but with the awareness not narrow and

148
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,200
tight but globally soft and expensive

149
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,440
so that everything is in a certain way included not that we're paying attention to everything and understanding

150
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,200
everything's going on but there's more like the there's a there's a feeling of openness in the body

151
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,320
uh a feeling of openness in the awareness that's not

152
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:35,279
stuck any one place or is not fixated any one place sometimes

153
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,559
concentration practice is associated with one pointedness which

154
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,679
can be you know just putting the attention on one place but that can be translated into a

155
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:51,039
stuckness into a fixation on one place which tends to be detrimental to the

156
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,720
person who's getting concentrated the idea is that awareness can be very soft

157
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,640
open even kind of an expansive feeling to it the attention the sense of presence that

158
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:10,159
we bring and that is so there's a kind of a a

159
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:16,559
it's kind of like if you

160
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,720
if you have a a big container like a

161
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,080
big jar full of sand and but you at the bottom there's a cone

162
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:39,360
and the bottom of the cone there's a little a valve and you can turn the valve and the sand pours through

163
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:46,320
then the sand will go pour in through the middle look from the top the middle falls in first and everything else

164
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,640
follows and so um and so it's kind of like we're we focus maybe

165
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,880
on the breathing but in the breathing we're kind of opening the faucet and everything begins

166
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,799
kind of flowing down through the force of gravity everything's included everything kind of

167
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,799
orients itself towards being here in this experience that can't happen

168
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:16,480
if we're prioritizing one part of our experience over other parts of the experience

169
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,760
if we're prioritizing our our emotions or prioritizing our

170
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:28,480
thinking and even prioritizing certain parts of our body or ideas about the body

171
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,480
or for prioritizing what should be happening too much and i like to think of this as kind of

172
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,880
living in emotions living through uh our thinking that where do we how do

173
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,240
we know some people live through certain parts of certain component parts of who

174
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,279
they are rather than living through the totality of who we are

175
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:56,720
and we do that we're limited and buddhism is the idea of freeing ourselves from those limitations of

176
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,720
being partial sometimes we use language of identification we identify with our

177
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:10,559
emotions we identify with our thoughts our ideas meaning that we define ourselves by them

178
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:15,679
i i emote therefore i am i think therefore i am

179
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:21,039
and i'm in pain therefore i am i suffer therefore i am

180
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:27,360
so we live in those things we take up a stance on those things we prioritize them in some way

181
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,640
and it's not to dismiss the importance of any of this and sometimes we need to give

182
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:39,039
caring attention to all these different parts of ourselves but to do it in a way where we don't live in it

183
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,880
we don't we don't uh give over importance to it so we limit

184
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,600
ourselves and so this idea of composing ourselves or unifying ourselves with awareness

185
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,799
so that the sense of presence with the body sense of being here is much more expansive and open to the

186
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:06,240
fluidity of of change the movements the the aliveness the an animated fluidity

187
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,080
of life from moment to moment that includes all of the above all these things

188
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:19,120
um so that because we're not compartmentalizing or fixating or in conflict or pushing

189
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:26,240
some things away and things become settled then the serenity begins settling in

190
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:32,880
we have an easier time to get um settled on something and we can settle on the breathing like

191
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,240
the sand all gets settled through this faucet maybe

192
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:45,120
and um that we open this valve we open things just flowing in so we're centered and

193
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,279
everything kind of comes along and is around it and gathers and is part of it but it's not an intentional thing of

194
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:57,760
gathering in it's more like we're open and relaxed that's why relaxation is so

195
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,039
important in meditation when we relax things have a chance to flow into

196
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:11,040
the center if the center is breathing it flows into the there and things have a chance to then settle

197
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:17,118
so there can be a calmness a tranquility a serenity that begins to occur

198
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:24,878
and i find it interesting that as the greater the calmness the more the calmness has no boundaries

199
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,560
the calmness almost feels like it's uh it extends out into the air the space

200
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:36,878
around me and with my eyes closed sitting i can't really feel the difference between the

201
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:43,118
inside and my outside of my body in relationship to the calmness and this idea that calmness begins

202
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:50,638
feelings like spreads and opens and has space for it all the calmness can hold our sorrow it can

203
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:57,040
hold our anger it could hold our pains it can hold our joys

204
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,480
it can hold the thinking mind all this has a place

205
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:09,680
but we're not prioritizing it we're not living in it it can just be there in the fluidity the movement the

206
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,520
the softness of life as it unfolds

207
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,880
so um so samata in that sometimes is to cultivate it

208
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,920
through concentration it might be with some you know

209
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,720
some centering one cell phones one's breathing but it's a centering where um there's an

210
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,920
opening going on so so we you know so on the exhale to

211
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,920
center ourselves on the breathing and maybe with the exhale also feeling that there's also an opening up into the

212
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:51,440
experience of breathing and then the inhale there's also an opening and receiving the experience of

213
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,440
breathing and and so there's we're centered on the experience of breathing but that

214
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,520
openness that open experience open feeling is one that is kind of like things open up so

215
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:10,160
everything can pour in the sand of our life so everything can pour in and and um and it isn't so much that it

216
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:16,160
pours in and fills it as it just pours through just everything has a fluid and

217
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,920
moving and flowing nothing is stuck

218
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,800
the deeper experiences of tranquility are ones where everything is flowing

219
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:36,240
everything is included everything is kind of allowed it's uh it's um

220
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,440
it's it's process nature it's a dynamic

221
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:48,000
nature everything is dynamic everything is process unless we fixate it on it or we think

222
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,400
too much about it then we can imagine it's kind of stuck or something

223
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,520
so samatha is very much an embodied experience

224
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,960
and so the ability to begin feeling and sensing calmness in the body

225
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:15,280
is a important foundation for this deeper

226
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:22,560
calmness that comes with a concentrated mind a unified mind a mind that knows how to be present

227
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:31,359
in a steady rooted way here for our experience i think of this calmness little bit as

228
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:36,640
as the ballast of a boat that the boat might have a keel with it's

229
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,400
quite heavy and um and so no matter how strong the winds goes the boat might tip a little

230
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,000
bit but it comes back to upright so the calmness is the balancer is that

231
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,119
gives us uh lets us kind of move relaxedly with

232
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,640
things and then come back to upright to presence we don't get knocked over

233
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:04,000
um calmness also sometimes associated with uh just letting being trans uh

234
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,640
being um porous and things because things are so calm

235
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,079
it's almost like the body the mind the heart is just so open everything just passes

236
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:23,359
right through when there's no calmness and we're fixated on something when we over prioritize or identify with

237
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:31,280
some part of ourselves it's kind of like putting up um you know a wall almost and life hits it life kind

238
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:37,280
of reacts to it and bumps into it and you know we have to deal with it but when we're relaxed

239
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,920
enough and don't prioritize or fixate on any one thing then the experiences of life kind of

240
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,839
move right through and now just to move you know just we're poorest to it

241
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:55,200
this is not to be aloof aloof and distant and disconnected from life

242
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,838
it actually lets us feel a deeper connection a deeper presence a deeper

243
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,880
intimacy that is both an intimacy to ourselves while there's a kind of intimacy with

244
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,040
the world so some of this is some of the deeper

245
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,800
benefits of cultivating calm and tranquility and um and the one that comes

246
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,680
specifically from uh the kind of uh

247
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,599
from meditation the concentration or the unification practices or

248
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,720
parts of what meditation does so um

249
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:44,640
maybe you can try it maybe you could today you can see how you can

250
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:51,359
relax any kind of way the mind is fixated or prioritizes anything or identifies with something as me myself

251
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:56,880
and mine see if you can open up the space open up the space of the body

252
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,480
the heart the mind to be more inclusive in is that creates space within which

253
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,680
things can relax it a little key little

254
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,280
tool for doing this is that giving yourself time

255
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,359
do things with lots of time opening up and making space for

256
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:25,119
just being open let it be open in time as well give give time

257
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:31,440
lots of time to your experience to what's happening so that uh this

258
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,319
samatha serenity can

259
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,640
can uh hold you can contain everything

260
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:48,560
so thank you very much and i look forward to the next talk on

261
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,119
calmness tomorrow
