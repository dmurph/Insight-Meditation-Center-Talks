1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,040
so good morning everyone and or good day hello and

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:13,639
welcome to the Insight Meditation Center

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,199
virtually so I like to offer the theme for today's meditation to

4
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:26,840
be something fundamental to Buddhism and that is freedom or

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,719
Liberation and what we can learn about freedom in the mind or in the

6
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:40,480
heart maybe through meditation or through Buddhist practice uh has uh invaluable lessons to

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,360
offer us for how to live in our regular life and the world with the degree of

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,520
freedom and Liberation as well but we learn it here we learn it in our own

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
minds and to have a mind which is not free is to have a mind which is caught

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,880
in its preoccupations a mind which is caught up in fantasy and lost in its

11
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,240
thought and we bring the Mind back to the breath or to the moment and then

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:19,479
immediately the mind has a mind of its own and takes us away and we feel like we have no control no role no agency

13
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:25,840
with our own mind and there's two things that uh stand out to me when I think about the

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,079
freedom in the mind one is certainly to have mastered a degree of agency with

15
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,640
the mind where we can choose what we think about where we can direct our

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,119
attention and the mind will stay there we know have the skills we have the capacity we have the freedom to be able

17
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:52,560
to direct the Mind where we'd like it to be and so in meditation that's invaluable to direct the mind to the

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:00,360
present moment to the breathing to being focused Here and Now is profound L

19
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,479
meaningful and valuable and now but the other understanding of freedom because we

20
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:17,239
can't always have that level of agency and freedom in the mind is the freedom to be

21
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:24,879
aware of what's happening in the mind the freedom to know so it's kind of like there's an

22
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:31,239
over uh you know there's a kind of sense of of a indep dependent Observer

23
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:36,519
Observer or observation that goes on where yes what the Mind thinks about

24
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:42,640
what it's involved in maybe is not so much under our control but we feel free because we can

25
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,200
observe it we can know it as it's happening and because of that we're not

26
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:55,040
so caught in it we're not so invested in it uh as we are when all our mental

27
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,599
energy goes into it there's a really important part of ourselves which is um um not

28
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:09,840
fueling the the patterns of the mind but rather is fueling her capacity to

29
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:19,920
observe to know to see to kind of stand independent of what the mind's Oddities

30
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:28,040
are so two forms of freedom and both of those uh can give us a sense of agency a

31
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,400
s sense of um not being lost not being the victims

32
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:40,360
of whatever the mind brings up to us so Freedom so this that'll be the

33
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:48,840
reference point for this meditation two kinds of Freedom if you can do the first great if you can't then

34
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,840
the second is the is the place to discover

35
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,720
Freedom so to assume a meditation posture

36
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,640
and to give some care and time to

37
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:19,040
establishing adjusting the subtleties of the posture is an expression of freedom and

38
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,160
agency that we are engaged in the process of finding a way to meditate

39
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,000
with our posture that feels the best we have

40
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,400
given circumstances straightening maybe the

41
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:44,560
spine letting the chest be open adjusting where the hands are so

42
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,800
the elbows have can be relaxed and it

43
00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:00,039
ease adjusting where the weight falls on your sitting bones

44
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:03,440
maybe so the belly can

45
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,240
relax and then to close your

46
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,880
eyes and with a sense of Freedom Choice

47
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:30,479
agency in your own way in a gentle supportive way take a few long slow deep breaths

48
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:39,280
where your choice your engagement in those breaths it's something you appreciate

49
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,960
you can do

50
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,080
enjoyable deep and full to the point just so it's

51
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,478
enjoyable and relaxing on the exhale

52
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,680
letting the breathing return to normal and maybe with the same appre

53
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:38,120
appreciation of your choice to do this more than your how well you can do

54
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:44,000
it as you exhale soften in your

55
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,360
face around the

56
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,520
eyes as you exhale soften in the

57
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,160
shoulders as you exhale soften the

58
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,919
belly breathing in a normal way

59
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:37,160
on the inhale feel whatever tension or contractions pressure there might be in

60
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,680
the thinking mind and as you

61
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,639
exhale soften the thinking

62
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:57,720
mind being less concerned about doing it successfully then with the pleasure or

63
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,159
Delight appreciation of being able to direct

64
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:09,199
your mind in in this into this effort to

65
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:30,919
soften and then on the inhale to feel what's happening in your heart

66
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:38,640
allow it to be as it is just feel it maybe appreciating the choice the

67
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:46,360
ability to feel more than what you

68
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:00,560
feel and then as you exhale to soften in the heart

69
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,279
again less interested in being successful as appreciating the

70
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:16,200
freedom to make the choice to attempt softening

71
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:41,240
and then with whatever ability you have even if it's for a

72
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:49,240
moment appreciate the freedom you have to now direct your

73
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,120
attention to the body's experience of breathing

74
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,040
feeling the inhale the

75
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,120
exhale and feeling how they're different from each other

76
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:47,800
appreciating whatever freedom and abil ability you have to stay with your breathing forever

77
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:54,600
long it might be and appreciate that as it

78
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,519
is and if you can't stay with the breathing appreciate your ability to

79
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,360
know and observe what it is that's happening

80
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,399
otherwise an observation that's not entangled or

81
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:22,880
reactive or if it is step back further and observe

82
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:31,240
that find the freedom in observing what's happening

83
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,399
rather than being entangled with what's

84
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
happening

85
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
for

86
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
for

87
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
for

88
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
for

89
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
for

90
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
for

91
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

92
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

93
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

94
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,880
for for

95
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:04,600
perhaps you can find some degree of fre Freedom or peace in the simplest ability to observe

96
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:11,520
what's happening or to know be aware of what's

97
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,120
Happening even if the ability to do so is ever so

98
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:27,159
short appreciate the ability to do so so you're not so caught up in what

99
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:30,760
you're aware of

100
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

101
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

102
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

103
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

104
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

105
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

106
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

107
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

108
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

109
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

110
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

111
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
for for

112
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,320
and then as we come to the end of this

113
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:42,440
sitting is there any way that you can appreciate your own inner capacity for

114
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:52,240
freedom freedom from afflictions mental afflictions by being calm and

115
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:59,080
peaceful a freedom to be able to direct the mind

116
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:05,640
and the mind is directable direct the mind to back to

117
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,278
the present moment and the mind goes along however

118
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:26,080
brief or the freedom to Simply observe know be aware of what's

119
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:32,799
happening and to sense that awareness that knowing is not

120
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,559
entangled not caught in for

121
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:46,480
against and however the mild that senses of the mind's

122
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:53,360
Freedom appreciate it be nourished by

123
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:03,000
it and imagine how that freedom can have a beneficial

124
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,480
role for when you interact with other people conversations and seeing them

125
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,200
thinking about

126
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,760
them and perhaps your own mental

127
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:30,158
Freedom can create the space in the mind and the Heart

128
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,440
for Good Will to

129
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:48,960
arise basic Good Will towards others because the absence of Good

130
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:57,518
Will is a kind of closing down kind of losing of the freedom

131
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,640
and with whatever good will that you have kindness

132
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,399
friendliness to wish others well and perhaps you can choose

133
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:21,000
particular people that you have you know or more generally for groups of people

134
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,760
or all people as I say these words

135
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,679
may all beings be

136
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:40,039
happy may all beings be

137
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:44,720
safe may all beings be

138
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:49,799
peaceful may all beings be

139
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,279
free and may we with our freedom choice

140
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:05,159
contribute to this possibility however small our

141
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,799
contribution is May all beings be

142
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:25,240
[Music]

143
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:33,819
happy thank you for [Music]

144
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:19,519
so welcome to this third talk on 10 Reflections for a Dharma life to live in

145
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,720
the Dharma in fact these uh 10 Reflections

146
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,240
can be called uh for living a spiritual life because there are reflections and

147
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,640
orientations for understanding people that are used by people who offer spiritual

148
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,320
counseling chaplaincy to others and um and I find them very

149
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,640
useful because they're really basic kind of to our Humanity so they don't know

150
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:54,080
out a purview of just Buddhism but in this context of teaching here I offer

151
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:01,799
them a little bit in the Buddhist context so uh for today and tomorrow the topic

152
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:07,440
is agency and autonomy and what I associate that with

153
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,000
the Positive coraly is a sense of freedom and

154
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,200
um and so uh when we are free to Enga to

155
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,919
have agency to engage and to act and to do and when we have sense of autonomy in

156
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,000
that activity that those actions um that comes with a sense of freedom

157
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,799
and capacity that uh if that's curtailed uh people suffer a lot people

158
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:43,399
are frustrated they feel oppressed they feel held in check they feel boxed in

159
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:51,200
they feel a sense of hopelessness and even helplessness but to uh give people to

160
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,960
allow people people discover a sense of agency that they can do they can make a

161
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:04,399
difference they can act and uh they're not held in check and this relates to

162
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,440
the to spiritual uh kind of needs that people

163
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:17,519
have human needs people have that we talked about Monday and Tuesday uh meaning and purpose that once

164
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:24,240
you have the real sense of what's important for you and uh the most important things most important values

165
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,799
most important intentions and important purpose the what you want to do how you

166
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:36,480
want to live your life then to have the ability to actually live that way and uh

167
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,919
and not be held in check by Inner forces in ourselves by our own uh fears our

168
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:47,559
resistance our hesitations our procrastination and not being held in

169
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:54,919
check by the world around us uh by the oppression that some people live in um

170
00:32:54,919 --> 00:33:01,080
the oppression of war the oppression of racism M of poverty and um lack of

171
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:08,880
opportunities educational opportunities lack of work opportunities there all kinds of ways in which people feel like

172
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,799
they can't engage and um and so to discover a sense

173
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:23,480
of agency to be empowered to act and then in uh some schools of

174
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:29,200
Buddhism they actually do empowerment Ceremonies for people

175
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,360
and uh and we don't we don't do that in our tradition particularly but maybe

176
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,880
sometimes we should because people don't sometimes feel like they have the

177
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,880
ability the permission the capacity to engage in certain kinds of practices

178
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:53,639
certain kinds of ways of living this their life living from certain values and um and on their own they can't do it

179
00:33:53,639 --> 00:34:00,639
but if you're given permission if someone believes in you if someone Champions you and there kind of support

180
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:08,040
you has your back as you do it um some people then feel oh now I can do it I can step into what's challenging and

181
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:14,720
Afraid for me and so to empower people to affirm people to encourage

182
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:22,720
people uh is for some people is in phenomenally useful and important and so for you uh as you

183
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,760
consider your own agency is that something that you feel like you're an a

184
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:34,200
agent of your own destiny that you have some choice and ability to act and um in

185
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,679
ways that are important for you that're invaluable for you uh that uh you feel

186
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,118
like it really would be an expression of being free to live the deepest values

187
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:52,878
that you have the deepest possibilities you have and um and so to understand where

188
00:34:52,879 --> 00:35:01,000
do we have agency and where we don't where is realistic agency healthy a agency and where is uh kind of unhealthy

189
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,040
ideas of agency and ideas of agency that are caught up in greed and hatred and

190
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,359
wanting to act and and uh uh uh from these kind of very negative UNH

191
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:21,760
wholesome impulses and to feel like I want to be free just to be angry I want to be free just to um you know to get

192
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,920
whatever it is that I want um that is a certain kind of freedom

193
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:35,240
but at the cost of hurting other people that is a certain kind of freedom but it's only an external Freedom it's not

194
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,839
an internal freedom in fact if we're caught up in greed and hatred um

195
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:45,960
something inside of us has been frozen something inide of us has stopped is

196
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,920
covered over is lost the deepest kind of agency from the deepest place of

197
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,319
well-being the deepest places in our hearts and minds and to discover that

198
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:04,640
uh like through meditation to discover a place of deep abiding value a deep

199
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:12,040
abiding sense of reflection and intimacy and peace and wisdom and creativity that

200
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:17,200
just feels so good to have and then feel like that can flow out of us into what

201
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,560
we do that we don't we have no we we don't have inhibitions for what is

202
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,599
healthy within us to come forth we don't have inhibitions to speak what feels

203
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:35,560
true speak the truth if necessary but to do so without being caught in fear or

204
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:41,319
caught in hatred or in greed to to do it from a deep sense of inner

205
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:47,280
freedom and so agency in Buddhism has a lot to do with the inner Freedom that we

206
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,880
can have even when the world around us oppresses us uh which is unfortunate and

207
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:01,480
terrible and something that we should work to overcome um we can't always do it completely but

208
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:07,000
we can even in mid midst of the life's challenges and limitations it puts on us

209
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,160
because of illness and sickness and loss and all kinds of things it is still

210
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:19,839
possible to find agency with ourselves how to find our own Freedom our own

211
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,200
relationship with our experience our own freedom from the ways in which we dampen

212
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:32,160
ourselves down or limit ourselves or um Clos close up or get

213
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,319
contracted which we do when we're operating from greed hatred and excessive

214
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:44,920
anxiety and so to discover these deeper Wellsprings within and feel the freedom

215
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:51,599
for those to flow out of us in spite of the external limitations that somehow we

216
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,839
have to live in maybe we have no choice sometimes uh to live certain ways um I

217
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:04,560
don't know if this is a appropriate example of this but uh certainly um I

218
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:11,319
became a parent a little bit late in life and um and I was surprised that

219
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:19,079
after being living for years and monasteries where there was a lot of limitations um that parenting with for

220
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:26,680
young children was phenomenally Li phenomenally limiting and um on sleep

221
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:35,680
and selfcare and all kinds of things just taking care of the babies and all this and um and so I mean I was a

222
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:42,800
limitation I had to live with I had to take care of these children and um at the expense of being free to do all

223
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:49,680
kinds of other things I was used to doing in my life but even there this was invaluable for me to Grapple with this

224
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,839
because there I could find work through these layers inside to find that deeper

225
00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:00,280
place of Freedom where agency had returned turned agency to be free in the

226
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,560
midst of limitations agency to engage choiceful and wisely with life as it's

227
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:17,119
given to me as opposed to how I wanted it to be and to be different so to um so to really look

228
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:23,200
deeply into this question of maybe in the wake of reflecting on meaning and

229
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:30,280
purpose um what is your sense of agency do you feel like you have agency in your life where do you feel like you don't

230
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:36,359
have it where are you held in check and where you're limited and where where can you find it

231
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:41,640
where can you find um an an empowerment maybe a

232
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:47,040
self-empowerment so you're not held in check you're not held in resistance you're not held in

233
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,400
procrastinations that you can step forward and uh let Set something

234
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,720
free but not something free that is crazy that's going to harm other people

235
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:04,079
or even harm yourself because we do have Oddities in our minds and hearts about

236
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:11,680
our desires and our wishes and our fantasies and delusions about what goes on what is it that's reliable what's the

237
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:19,319
reliable source of agency within that uh allows us to feel free creative

238
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:27,440
intelligent wise um and one of the characteristics of that is it has a profound sense of

239
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:35,119
peace peace as part of it and a pro profound sense of Good Will and respect

240
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:42,720
that comes from this deep Wellspring where the spiritual Freedom lives within

241
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:52,400
us so um um so agency and that's the if you're

242
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:59,359
inclined at all that's the theme for reflection for these next 25 4 hours um

243
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:05,839
how does that work for you uh is another word that you would rather use an agency

244
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:11,040
that maybe speaks to this what I'm talking about today better than

245
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:17,280
agency um maybe simply the phrase freedom to act freedom to live from our

246
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,800
deepest values but maybe you have a different phrase that is useful for you to reflect on this and where do you not

247
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:31,400
have a sense of agency where do you feel in check where do where would it be useful for you to discover um greater

248
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:37,680
freedom and agency to be empowered to be self-empowered or to have someone who

249
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,720
believes in you um reflect back to you yes you can do this it's

250
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:53,000
okay and um and uh so agency so thank you and tomorrow

251
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:00,720
I'll talk about autonomy which uh also then ra raises this interesting uh question of um

252
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:09,480
doesn't some of these teachings of meaning purpose and an a an agency uh rub a little bit

253
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:15,240
wrong against the Buddhist teachings of um not self the idea of autonomy isn't

254
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:22,440
that little bit opposed to those teachings and I would like to say not but that will sa for

255
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,160
tomorrow so thank you very much and um May you have

256
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:37,200
a day of uh discovering greater freedom for how you can live your life
