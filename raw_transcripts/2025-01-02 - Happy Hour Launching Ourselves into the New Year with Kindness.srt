8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,199
our meditation posture whether you're sitting in a chair if you need to move

9
00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:02,079
to a position that's more comfortable actually just take a moment all of us and maybe lean left and right maybe

10
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,200
stretch your arms maybe leing forward and backward

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,400
really finding your center of gravity becoming embodied really feeling your

12
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:20,320
body before settling feeling the body any way that the body wants to be

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:28,400

the year makes me so happy to be practicing with you

146
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,039
oh so the Arc of our practice today the

147
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:02,519
guided meditation was the beginning I invited us to settle we always begin by settling

148
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:11,279
in the body settling arriving in the body a sense of body stable the Earth element

149
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:19,279
connected to the Earth and then the breath the air element the sense of uplift uplift in the heart and stability

150
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:26,200
in the body and uh and receiving the breath relaxing and

151
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:33,720
receiving not so much going out and for focusing trying to catch the breath and then I invited you with the in breath to

152
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:40,600
lean into receiving this gift of aliveness gift of presence so that we

153
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,039
become more embodied with the in breath and with the out breath I invited you to

154
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:52,799
breathe out this good willll s of you know the these wishes of Goodwill

155
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:59,120
as if your out breath is is um is showering you with with the wishes of

156
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:07,200
Goodwill and we start with ourselves wishing ourselves well as a way of cultivating friendliness meta Goodwill

157
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:15,880
and then we turned to someone who's hopefully easy um and then if it was available

158
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:22,640
invited you to open to someone who's just a little challenging wishing them well again in order to feel safe

159
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,840
sometimes you have to put them like way way way far away but can we still wish them well

160
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:35,559
and and oh and the metaphor that I invited you to bring in with both with yourself and with the dear being was

161
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:40,640
this metaphor of like launching yourself as if you were a child you you were your

162
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:48,440
own child you know the same way that parents pack up a lunch box and sent off their children into into the day with

163

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:07,559
embracing ourselves with Good Will these dear beings We Are Who suffer and and

166
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:12,880
have aspirations and resolutions and goodwi and challenges and all of that

167
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,480
and launching ourselves with Good Will into the ear and um and similarly for

168
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,919
our uh dear being and then as I mentioned switching to someone we have

169
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:31,840
some challenges with if that was possible accessible with without getting off kilter and then at the end opening

170
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:39,440
to all beings everywhere with cultivating our Good Will sharing our good wishes knowing that of

171
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:48,320
course happiness all the time is not possible for ourselves for our loved ones for for all beings so no attachment

172
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,760
to outcome but we do this practice to cultivate our own heart in friendliness

173
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:00,519
in meeting ourselves others uh with with good willll with kindness so that was

174
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:08,000
the arc so so the invitation for the small

175
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,120
groups uh breakout groups in the moment and and if you can stay I invite you to

176
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:20,000
stay it's sweet and auspicious to practice on the first day of the year with with

177
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,120
um yeah with Sana sharing your Goodwill sharing your good wishes for the new

178
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,279
year what are your aspirations for the new year year um if you feel comfortable

179
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:36,399
sharing them um I think it's quite sweet to be held Witness by another human

180
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:45,880
being who is on this path and is practicing um kindness Goodwill to share our um to

181
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:54,360
share our aspirations with them so so I I'll put the guidelines um in in chat

182
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:02,600
the guidelines for small groups is practicing meta mindfully listening and speaking really taking treating the

183
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:10,480
breakout as a continuation of the meditation embracing compassion noticing

184
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,080
if any resistance uh arises or discomfort internally externally and

185
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:23,639
meeting it with kindness compassion as long as you meet everything with kindness you're practicing stay on topic the topic

186
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:30,679
tonight the the um prompt and let's go in alphabetical order according to first

187
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:36,639
name the prompt is um what is your aspiration in the ways that you wish to

188
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:42,200
grow uh just a tiny bit maybe just one aspiration for yourself

189
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,679
in the new year um and if you like if you feel okay sharing please do that

190
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:54,200
that would be one round you can say pass no problem um or and you could the

191
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,559
second round perhaps you can share if you like something that came up in this guided meditation and it could be

192
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:04,760
anything um I fell asleep or I or I felt a little kindness towards this person

193
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:10,039
I've been having challenges with it wasn't as hard as I thought or maybe oh it was really hard it was harder than I

194
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:15,600
thought that's all good so staying on topic and taking turns briefly so each

195
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,399
person shares a little nugget and the next person then the next person comes back to you again you go around and

196
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:27,919
round avoiding cross talk interrupting giving another person advice um keeping

197
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,919
the space safe and kind so so as long as we're practicing

198
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:41,919
kindness um in the small groups they we're doing the practice right there's no right or wrong so so I'm creating the

199
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:49,279
breakout rooms now take care of yourselves take care of each other and really celebrate the the opportunity to

225
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:50,640
go through the previous year and uh look through my calendar and see what

226
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:57,040
it jogs in my memory and write it down and and um you know always there's

227
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,960
massive amounts of things that I've forgotten um so I was I had just begun doing that

228
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:11,240
before we sat down tonight but I I saw that uh I was looking at my intentions for the previous year for

229
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,560
2024 and you know they were full of the intentions were the sort of unsurprising

230
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,640
good things that you know we aim for here to live in kindness to uh to be of

231
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:28,560
service to to be more open to live in love and and I felt like

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:35,640
well yeah I kind of did that this year I I I worked at it and um and that was the

233
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:43,839
right direction and I you know I really credit um happy hour and practice and

234
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:49,800
the close examination of this with uh with close friends for whom it's important

235
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:59,200
too um and it's it's it's wonderful to actually see results and to um to

236
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:06,240
not presume anything to be accomplished no mission accomplished here but uh just

237
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:14,319
to be inclining in the way that I desire and to um to be able to be clear right

242
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:44,720
Buddhist practice which is really setting an intention as you did for pre previous

243
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:51,160
year setting the intention and then working at it throughout the and then at the end saying oh yes there was progress
