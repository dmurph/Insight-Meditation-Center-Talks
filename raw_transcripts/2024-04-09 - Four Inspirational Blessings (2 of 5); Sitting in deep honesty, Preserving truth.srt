1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:08,200
so good morning friends let's go ahead and uh start

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:15,279
meditating together so settling

3
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:22,960
in and finding a a good posture for

4
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,960
meditation if you're comfortable doing so please close your eyes

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,760
eyes and just sensing the body from the

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,079
inside letting go of ideas

7
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,640
about your computer or the day before

8
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:05,119
you coffee whatever has been on on your mind as you're moving toward this

9
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,080
session and allowing the attention to become

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,759
simpler just oriented toward sitting in this

11
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,240
posture supported by the chair or the cushion or the

12
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,720
bed wherever you're

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,920
sitting

14
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:43,159
maybe taking a couple of long slow deep breaths and on the out breath softening

15
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,359
the

16
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,479
body feeling into the stability of where you're

17
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,679
sitting your weight [Music]

18
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:17,319
resting down onto the chair or cushion or

19
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,959
bed the

20
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:31,840
floor allowing yourself to tune into the kind of basic

21
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:42,560
physicality that is ever present but we don't always put our attention on

22
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:50,319
it and it may be that the physical being is not so comfortable at this moment

23
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,040
that's always the possibility in the

24
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:03,309
body but just allowing that to be as it is [Music]

25
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:28,760
also gently inviting softening through the face the

26
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:36,799
eyes down through the shoulders and the arms

27
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,159
and

28
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,870
hands softening down through the

29
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,959
[Music]

30
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:07,560
Torso the muscles of the upper back diaphragm

31
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:18,199
area belly and the low back often as we soften the muscles that

32
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:25,660
we habitually hold rigid there's a new sense of support or

33
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:33,000
[Music] straightening almost from the inside

34
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,120
out that we

35
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,600
liberate through allowing ourselves to be at

36
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,639
ease releasing the hip joints

37
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,520
down through the legs all the way to the

38
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,400
feet tuning into the Natural Balance of the

39
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,639
body trusting it to find its alignment in

40
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
gravity

41
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,080
when wheel is well balanced the axle right in the middle of

42
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:14,440
the wheel and the wheel is round if you spin it it's said to spin

43
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,339
true this is one of the meanings of [Music]

44
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,638
true can your body sit in a posture that is

45
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,560
true aligned balanced

46
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,319
simple however that looks for your

47
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:06,560
body and bringing attention also to the

48
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
mind the inner

49
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:22,960
life perhaps looking upon that with just natural inner

50
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:31,520
gaze like we might just see what's there are there emotions

51
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,560
present

52
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,319
thoughts intentions over other kinds of

53
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
feelings

54
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,159
looking upon these with ease and

55
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,440
softness inviting the mind also to relax

56
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,159
in the simple awareness of

57
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,959
mindfulness as with the body the Mind may not be entirely comfortable at this

58
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:09,000
moment entirely Pleasant or [Music]

59
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,959
easeful and similarly we can let that be as it

60
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
is

61
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,959
just

62
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
knowing

63
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,160
if you're familiar with the noting

64
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,920
practice You may wish to do that for a few

65
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,399
minutes this is a way of just gently

66
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,079
naming what is arising in the

67
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,639
mind and it changes you know we may have a moment

68
00:10:53,639 --> 00:11:00,040
of sadness but then we

69
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,600
move to

70
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,760
hearing and then a sense of softness as we

71
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,120
exhale and

72
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,440
ease and then a

73
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:31,240
thought so we say thinking gently in the mind

74
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:51,639
or if a word is too much we can just have kind of an

75
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,880
impression clearly knowing each

76
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,079
experience through the impression it makes in the mind like feet make

77
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,320
impressions in the

78
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
sand

79
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,880
this kind of simple noting is

80
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:09,240
a way of being clear about what's happening in experience rather than someone

81
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:20,320
disconnected but perhaps just as

82
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,680
importantly it's a way of being honest about what's

83
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,560
happening the aim of noting is to really know what

84
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,880
what is

85
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,360
arising and if it's anger then we've done the task when

86
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,440
we've labeled it to

87
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,040
anger and then we move on it's not oh

88
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:05,320
anger oh I shouldn't have that how can I get rid of that that's

89
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,759
one of the

90
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,320
hindrances instead it's just a note that was anger and then the next

91
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,519
moment maybe something

92
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:29,880
else it's okay if what arises is something that you would call

93
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,639
a hindrance or an UNH wholesome mind

94
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:43,079
state if you've noted it it wasn't taking over your

95
00:14:52,120 --> 00:15:01,040
mind wonder if we were really open and honest just labeling

96
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:08,600
everything as it comes with no concern that it says

97
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,160
anything about you or your

98
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
practice

99
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:53,920
so if you'd like resting in that space of deep openness and

100
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:00,920
honesty there's a lot of care in that

101
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

102
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

103
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

104
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

105
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

106
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

107
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:34,120
e if the mind has drifted away and moved

108
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:42,559
into [Music] thinking then we note

109
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,720
thinking the mind is back to the

110
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,200
present back to sensing things as they

111
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:17,520
are if there was any concern about that or judgment then it's just

112
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,018
judging it's just what the mind is [Music]

113
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
doing

114
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:38,320
just as we said about the well balanced

115
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,919
wheel that it will spin [Music]

116
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:56,360
true there's a way that when the mind is just willing to be simple and

117
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,880
present then the mind mind has come into

118
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,640
true it's just its so knowing

119
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,440
itself and there can even be a visceral sense of

120
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:35,440
relief when we really [Music] know what is happening

121
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:45,000
honestly it's such a relief allowing that ease in the

122
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,840
mind of being

123
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
true

124
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

125
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

126
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

127
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

128
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

129
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

130
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

131
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

132
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

133
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,880
and now gently bringing in again the awareness

134
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:45,120
of the body sitting or [Music]

135
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,248
lying posture that you're [Music]

136
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,240
in maybe feeling the breath coming in going [Music]

137
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
out

138
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,360
sensing if there is some sense of alignment or

139
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:21,320
integration is there a way that the Deep honesty with the Mind

140
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,000
informs some connection with the

141
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:32,080
body feeling of

142
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:51,159
Hess you might it be that this Foundation of really being

143
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:58,880
clear about what's happening moment to [Music] moment feels like a

144
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,240
reliable foundation for navigating

145
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:17,360
life starting from this place of really

146
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:25,240
knowing without our projections ideas

147
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:34,320
judgments that might be that we would then choose not to say something or

148
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:42,799
choose a particular action but when we do so from

149
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:50,159
this deeply truthful Foundation it's much more likely to be

150
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,559
beneficial this way of perceiving being open sprad

151
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:06,720
from us to others we can include other people also really seeing

152
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,360
them as they

153
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:20,399
are really seeing them freshly not through the filter of

154
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,399
yesterday or last

155
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:34,840
year and there we can choose how to respond which parts of

156
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,080
reality to speak

157
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,240
to but always starting from this place of

158
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,919
tress and tress within our own being it's a very beautiful offering for

159
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,039
the world and it's

160
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:05,440
done just internally privately quietly what others

161
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,639
can feel it without us having to

162
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:20,240
say so considering what you've learned from this basis of deep

163
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:29,960
honesty for being with others

164
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,669
[Music]

165
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,919
for

166
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:12,799
so we're talking this week about four

167
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:21,799
foundational practices that are very simple to name and pretty simple to start doing in some

168
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:28,159
way and then they can keep unfolding in our practice for a long time eventually

169
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:35,240
going quite deep so I like things like this where they're immediately accessible but then

170
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:41,799
if we really follow them for a long time they are onward leading and keep opening

171
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:50,320
up more and more so we're talking about them first as practices and then uh near near the end

172
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,159
of this week we'll reframe them as beautiful benefits in our

173
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,840
life so these are these four are to not neglect

174
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:09,960
wisdom to preserve truth to cultivate

175
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:16,279
relinquishment and to train for peace so yesterday we talked about ways

176
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:21,679
to keep connected to whatever wisdom we've developed and we all have some

177
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:28,519
because it starts right away when we begin practicing sometimes the bigger issue is

178
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:33,960
that we don't remember to be in touch with what wisdom we have it's less about

179
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,880
I don't have enough wisdom yet and more about I'm not accessing what I do

180
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:46,799
have paraphrasing Sharon saltzburg mindfulness is easy but remembering to

181
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,120
be mindful is difficult but when we do

182
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:58,440
remember to be aware of just this and to bring in a wise perspective

183
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,240
we have more clarity in navigating our life whether on or off the

184
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,279
cushion So today we're moving on to preserving

185
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:17,639
truth preserving truth so if someone for example the Buddha

186
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:24,159
said to you preserve the truth what would you do with that how

187
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,440
would you do that so when I consider such a phrase it

188
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:37,120
strikes me that the verb is to preserve so what is true is therefore

189
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:43,559
something that could be preserved or maybe not and and when we don't what is

190
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:48,600
that what does it mean to not preserve the truth is it mean kind of allowing it

191
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,639
to Decay or covering it over or distorting

192
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:59,720
it but instead we can practice with preserving it

193
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,480
I visited a state park a few days ago where ecosystems and certain species of

194
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,599
trees are being preserved and I've also visited Wildlife

195
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:20,200
preserves where animals are protected so I see preservation as

196
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:26,720
something beautiful that is done out of a sense of care out of a sense of deeply

197
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,158
valuing what is being preserved along with the accurate

198
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,240
understanding that it could be lost if action isn't

199
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:43,960
taken so do you see truth in that way is it something that you deeply value to

200
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,358
the point of wanting to actively preserve

201
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,158
it maybe we need to look at this word uh

202
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:01,280
truth sometimes that can be a little bit of a sticky word the poly

203
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,760
word is simply Sacha which is always translated as truth and it it's pretty

204
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:15,440
much a direct translation and in pully just like in English um there are multiple shades of

205
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:22,440
meaning of the word satcha the word truth I can say with confidence that the

206
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:28,359
Buddha does not appear to be advocating a fundamentalist kind of Truth an

207
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:34,240
absolutist truth that is rigid or dogmatic I think it would be very hard

208
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:41,720
to read the sutas and get that impression so instead there's an

209
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,920
understanding that there are different layers or levels or aspects of what is

210
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:54,079
true and part of the art of Dharma practice is to align ourselves

211
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,400
appropriately with some kind of Truth if we're out of

212
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,760
alignment something is off something is not well oriented in

213
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:11,000
us so I guess I'll I'll say that I'm not I'm not really afraid of the word truth

214
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:18,640
there are things that are true and things that are false or deceptive and that can be known in ways that are

215
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,720
appropriate for a given situation budh is teachings support this

216
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:30,440
this way of thinking about the truth so don't worry we won't be analyzing all the kinds of Truth for

217
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:37,000
today I just thought it was important to clarify that term a bit we're just going

218
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,200
to consider what we can clearly know in our life know the basic the basic kinds

219
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:48,480
of truths that we may wish to preserve in our actions of body speech and mind

220
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,359
and some ways that we can do that so if we're not neglecting wisdom

221
00:36:54,359 --> 00:37:02,200
then we are in touch with some kind of Truth so for example this cup uh is

222
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:09,119
warm and my sweater looks reddish to my

223
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,560
eyes and there's a pressure of my feet against the floor and it

224
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:21,560
feels it feels like it does right now I can feel it from the inside and I'm

225
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:28,920
speaking these words and I know that I'm speaking there's no Distortion there no judgments or Pro C or

226
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:35,599
[Music] abstractions so maybe consider for a moment just a few things like that that

227
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:44,079
are true for you in this moment can you notice any feeling of clarity in alignment with just those

228
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,780
basic things that are that are true at this [Music]

229
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,160
moment so one of the best ways to practice with preserving truth is in our

230
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,880
speech in our communic ation so once we get into these truths

231
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:08,319
that are where we're sharing communicating with others it can get a little bit dicier now we have to be a

232
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:15,119
little bit more precise about what it means to preserve truth in a more public

233
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:22,319
way but just as an example um something I do when I uh write in an email to

234
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:28,720
somebody um we're arranging you we're calendaring together and I write to them I've put this in my

235
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:35,119
calendar I actually pause in writing the email I go and I put that into my

236
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:42,480
calendar and I save it and only then do I press send on the email it would be

237
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,560
easy to dash off the email saying I put it in my calendar and then go do it but

238
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:58,079
that makes the statement in the email not quite true doesn't it I haven't put it in my calendar yet so um I put it in

239
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,400
my calendar before I send the email these little details can be

240
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,440
important so you know as noted we have to be clearer when we're when we start

241
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:13,960
sharing or communicating with others then we have to look at this truth there

242
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:20,920
is a teaching in the sutas maim Manaya 95 where somebody asks the Buddha how to

243
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:26,920
preserve truth it's a Brahman and he literally says in what way is there the

244
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:32,280
preservation of truth how does one preserve truth we ask Master godma

245
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:38,480
that's the Buddha about the preservation of truth and the poly verb there for

246
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:47,480
preservation is rockety which is also means to safeguard or protect so and the Buddha replies to

247
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:54,720
this Brahman if a person has Faith they preserve the truth when they say my

248
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,480
faith is thus but they do not yet come to the definite conclusion only this is

249
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:08,079
true anything else is wrong and if a person reaches a conclusion based on reasoning then they

250
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:15,240
preserve truth when they say my reasoning is thus but they do not yet come to the definite conclusion only

251
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:23,440
this is true anything else is wrong and so on the Buddha names five things total not just faith and

252
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:31,280
reasoning so it's clear I think what this teaching is saying cite your source so rather than just

253
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:37,200
asserting something as a definite truth we carefully say how we know what we're

254
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,440
saying or why we have come to think that maybe we're believing it because we read

255
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,960
it in the Wall Street Journal or we read it in Al jazer or we heard it on Fox News and we trust that platform of

256
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,119
Journalism so we say this is where I read this or this is where I heard this

257
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:04,160
or maybe we thought about it and we're trusting our own logical ability so we say that or maybe we did a

258
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,920
scientific experiment and we're quoting data from

259
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:17,240
that so you know yesterday I watched the eclipse using a pinhole camera I didn't

260
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,319
exactly see the sun being eclipsed because we can't look at the sun um but

261
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:27,400
I saw a projection of the sun with a curved portion cut out of it during the

262
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:34,880
time frame when the eclipse happened so if you ask whether I saw the eclipse I could say yes but I could also

263
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:41,000
preserve the truth more by clarifying that I saw it in this particular

264
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:49,640
way so this might be a wonderful practice to do if you're interested you could try for a whole day

265
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,880
or just a morning maybe to say the source behind every declarative

266
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,119
statement that you make so options include um trust you

267
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:06,280
trust where you heard something or maybe you have uh sense of approving of

268
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,680
something this is aligned with my values so that's why I'm saying it or this is

269
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,359
how our society conceives of something so I'm saying it out of cultural

270
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:23,040
tradition or I'm saying it out of logic I thought it through and this is how I

271
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,720
see it or maybe you reflected about somebody else's View you know my friend

272
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:37,000
told me this and I thought about it and that makes sense so can you preserve truth through

273
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,960
your speech in this way other people may look at you a little funny for being so careful and

274
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:51,319
clear but that just shows how loose we usually are with being being clear about

275
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:56,960
preserving the truth in this way and then by the way the other part

276
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:03,720
of preserving truth in what the Buddha said is that we don't believe that we're certain you know we don't come to the

277
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,839
definite conclusion only this is true everything else is wrong so this is more

278
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:16,319
of a mental Act of preserving truth is that even when we make statements and we declare this is why I think it's true we

279
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:21,720
keep things open in our mind maybe this is how it is and this is why I think so

280
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:28,920
but in in our mind we remember maybe it's not maybe I don't have all the information maybe my trust wasn't

281
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:34,680
correct maybe my logic was faulty this time around can we keep things open in

282
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:41,160
our mind it's interesting that preserving the truth includes remembering that it

283
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,440
might not be completely

284
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:52,000
true we can also preserve the truth through meditative contemplation and

285
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,400
this is a very important skill for living a Dharma life or for living gener

286
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:03,720
with Integrity a friend of mine who's a teacher in another tradition Buddhist

287
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,960
teacher from another tradition um paraphrased it this way I

288
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:15,400
want to say something about what he said about a practice that he does that I've done too and really

289
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:22,040
like so he says in every situation particularly difficult ones take the

290
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:28,040
time and make the effort to know what is true often there are multiple facets to

291
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:35,760
a situation physical emotional and spiritual which is true all of them we

292
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,200
practice with this by simply including all of those different perspectives just

293
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,960
holding them in intention not doing anything with them with time and some

294
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:53,920
trust the truth of the matter will reveal itself when we're able to see or

295
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,400
understand what is true and accept it even though it may be very painful mind

296
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:06,520
and body relax we find relief just from allowing everything to be there as it is not

297
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:15,040
suppressing or projecting what comes out of that easing of tension is almost always good and

298
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:21,000
wholesome I really liked the way he said that and how he points to a a visceral

299
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,079
feeling that happens when we get aligned with the truth he calls it an easing of

300
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,680
tension have you ever felt this when you were finally able to accept the full

301
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,599
reality of a situation I have we can know in our very

302
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,359
being that we are touching into what is true it can be quite a process to get

303
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:49,280
there because we don't get to choose how long it takes for the truth to reveal

304
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:56,280
itself but if we have this practice of staying open wanting to include more and

305
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:02,200
more keeping things in alignment then eventually we

306
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:07,400
can get this direct feeling of Yep this is it this is we've landed on at least

307
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:15,640
as far as I can know the truth with my ability at this moment and that can be a guide or a beacon on the path this is

308
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:23,800
what the Buddha is calling in the foundation truth that's what he's calling it so our deepest experience of Truth

309
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,920
can become a reference point for further deepening

310
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:37,800
so I wish you all the courage to live in this kind of non- deception this kind of

311
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:44,839
alignment of tress and to preserve the truth is one of the most beautiful things that we can

312
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:51,800
start doing immediately at the level that we can and it will deepen and deepen and deepen and it can go all the

313
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:58,119
way to the deepest truth so thank you

314
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:06,400
and may it be a wonderful day of Truth so

315
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,400
tomorrow
