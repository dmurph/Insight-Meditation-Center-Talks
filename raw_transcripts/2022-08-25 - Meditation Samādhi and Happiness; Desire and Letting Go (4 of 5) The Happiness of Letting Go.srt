1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,879
everyone let's go ahead and [Music] start our day together

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:13,599
our time together so

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,920
settling in for meditation finding uh

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,640
your usual posture for sitting or whatever feels appropriate for you today

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,440
and if you're comfortable doing so you can close your eyes

6
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,920
and just having a sense of turning in or settling in

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,670
to your own experience of your body how it is now your mind how it is now

8
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,889
[Music]

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,228
feeling balanced where you're sitting [Music]

10
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:17,439
today the meditation will be on mindfulness of breathing

11
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,920
in a similar style as is taught by vikku anaglio

12
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:32,079
so it comes from the suta on mindfulness of breathing the anapanasanti suta

13
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,880
which has many interpretations

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,960
so as you settle in to the body

15
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,119
having a sense that you are in a secluded area

16
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:58,719
probably or you found a place where you can sit that's a little bit removed from

17
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,960
other people in your house for example and just enjoying that sense of

18
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:12,039
to whatever degree of seclusion you have at this time

19
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,120
tuning in to the sense of straightness in the spine

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,720
could be that you're sitting upright or it's also fine to feel the straightness as you're in the lying down posture

21
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,680
and just passing the attention through the spine from the bottom to the top

22
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,959
feeling each vertebra relaxing and aligning

23
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,120
the spine

24
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,560
you can go kind of slowly

25
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:28,440
so having the sense that you're supported by the straight and relaxed spine

26
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,920
and then bringing to mind some motivation

27
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:47,360
for practicing it could just be your specific motivation for this sit

28
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,400
it could be your overall inspiration to practice

29
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,879
it's nice if it has an altruistic dimension to it connecting with your

30
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,840
your inspiration

31
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,759
and then establishing in the mind

32
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:31,840
mindfulness so bringing the awareness of the present moment

33
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,960
to the foreground

34
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,520
and actually taking a deliberate period of time to sense what it feels

35
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,479
like when there is mindfulness in the mind what does mindfulness feel like for you

36
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,479
right now perhaps clear and sharp

37
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,759
or soft and warm

38
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,759
broad and spacious

39
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,600
what is the flavor of mindfulness right now

40
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,440
and then gently turning the attention to the

41
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,720
sense of in and out breathing

42
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:51,319
you don't need to feel the breath at any specific place

43
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,039
but for now just maybe a general sense of knowing when you're breathing in and

44
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,800
when you're breathing out in whatever way it's easy to connect

45
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,840
with that

46
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:34,280
so we have the sense of mindfulness the sense of in and out breathing

47
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,599
allowing that to fill the attention

48
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,880
if the mind feels drawn toward other concerns at this time

49
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:06,960
you just gently say not now i will definitely get back to you later

50
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,560
for now staying with the

51
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,840
in and out breathing

52
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,400
and now we draw the attention a little bit closer to the breath

53
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:59,000
in order to know the length of the breath

54
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,440
all that needs to be known is whether it's on the longer side or on the shorter

55
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,560
side the in breath and the out breath

56
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,759
so we have to pay attention along the whole length of the breath

57
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,800
and then the whole length of the out breath

58
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,200
just generally knowing is the in-breath long or short is the

59
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,839
out breath long or short they might be different

60
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,160
natural breath

61
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:19,040
we may find that as we watch the breath gradually gets

62
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:26,600
shorter release the active part of the breath

63
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,040
there may be a longer gap

64
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,860
[Music]

65
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:09,199
and then opening the awareness now to feel the entire body breathing

66
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:19,079
we don't change the breath at all just change the breadth of the attention

67
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:33,480
so that we're aware of the whole body sitting and the breath occurring in the body

68
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,600
no longer needing to notice the length

69
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:18,560
and when the mind feels connected throughout the body

70
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,079
still paying attention to the in and out breathing

71
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,240
we incline the mind toward tranquility

72
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,959
in the body

73
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,600
it helps to physically soften [Music]

74
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,720
areas of tension

75
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,200
it helps that the simple repetitive nature of the breath

76
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,839
can act as a an anchor for the mind

77
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:13,720
allowing other feelings of busy energy in the body to settle out

78
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,240
search tranquility throughout the body

79
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,800
and when the mind gets distracted as it surely will

80
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:30,079
we just smile [Music] and gently return

81
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,920
to the sense of the whole body in and out breathing

82
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,639
[Music] and an invitation to

83
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,839
tranquility of the body

84
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,720
it's a soft invitation not a our narrow focus

85
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,040
on the breath

86
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,120
points toward ease

87
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,759
a simple sense of being present with the body and the breath

88
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,120
as the body becomes even slightly more tranquil

89
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,120
the bodily activities are calmed even a bit

90
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,399
we can recheck the posture maybe a slight shift would help the body

91
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,839
feel more balanced

92
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:20,279
it's natural that as tensions release some adjustments are helpful

93
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,279
just balancing with that sense of in and out breathing

94
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,240
and as the body becomes somewhat more

95
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,679
calm it's very natural that a sense of joy

96
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:53,280
can arise so opening the mind to the possibility

97
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,880
of a kind of inner joy that comes about because of being in

98
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,880
meditation

99
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:25,600
it's often felt in the body feels like a almost like an inner smile

100
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,200
emerging from that ease

101
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:45,520
but even if it's very mild or we don't even feel any of that joy

102
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,320
we can also feel in the mind just a sense of contentment

103
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,440
content that we are mindful at this moment present for

104
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,919
what's going on in the body and the mind

105
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,039
the joy the slight joy of mindfulness can be this

106
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,759
contentment

107
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,679
if we can feel the happiness of presence it's actually a happiness that's always available

108
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,880
anytime we're mindful

109
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,440
so allowing the mind and body to feel this inner

110
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,039
joy or at least contentment

111
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:04,320
mindfulness does not always have to be a neutral noting of

112
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,440
exactly what's happening we can incline the mind

113
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,039
toward this kind of inner well-being and pleasure

114
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,720
just allow that to be there resting in that

115
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,799
along with the body and the in and out breathing

116
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:15,520
it's natural that as we feel even some degree of this joy

117
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:24,480
happiness of sitting of breathing that the mind will become calmer

118
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:32,880
we see that busy mental activities of wanting or not wanting

119
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:41,240
are less enjoyable than simple presents

120
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,080
resting in awareness we can watch the movements of the mind

121
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,120
slowly settle out as we watch the agitation in the body

122
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,080
slowly settle out

123
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:31,720
such tranquility available

124
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:37,799
we can get a sense that peace is possible

125
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:46,640
pretty close to our daily life something quite different is available

126
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,559
when the mind is able to be present and still

127
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,039
and although the conditions will change in a few minutes

128
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,520
we might consider as we go out into the world

129
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,840
change our way of being our level of consciousness

130
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,960
what are we willing to give up our peace for

131
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,000
this peace that we feel

132
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:43,679
what is more important than that as we get out into our lives

133
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:51,278
is it worth getting tangled up in a conflict or in anxiety

134
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,559
or in pursuit of something

135
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,720
is there a way we could just carry this into our interactions

136
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:15,240
into our work into our errands of the day or our tasks

137
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,080
and to see what a gift that is for others maybe they too would feel just a bit of

138
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,080
that

139
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:53,600
gil often says there's no way to practice just for yourself

140
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,760
it has to help others even in these very simple ways if we carry the

141
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:08,200
practice forward from meditation into the world

142
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,919
foreign

143
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,799
[Music]

144
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,950
[Music]

145
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,720
hmm

146
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:16,559
so yesterday we talked about two sets of three two triads

147
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:24,399
where one is unwholesome and one is wholesome and the two sets are

148
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:30,240
sense desire comma ill will and cruelty on one side and

149
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:38,880
renunciation which is nate comma or letting go of sense pleasures non-ill will and non-cruelty

150
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,880
on the other side and we learned that in buddhist teachings these are applied to

151
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,520
intentions and thoughts and perceptions such that we might say that renunciation

152
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,720
or letting go is an attitude that we can bring to our life

153
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:04,880
and it's skillful which means that it leads onward on the path of spiritual development

154
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:11,360
so i didn't get to quite all the sutas that talk about this triad and i want to read just one more a little excerpt from

155
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,200
just one more because it points out that these same sets of three

156
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,360
are important in relationship and community life so

157
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:30,159
the buddha says in one suta i am not even comfortable thinking about

158
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,200
a place where people argue quarreling and fighting continually

159
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:43,120
wounding each other with barbed words let alone going there i come to a conclusion about them

160
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,320
clearly those people have given up three things and cultivated three things

161
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,480
what three things have they given up thoughts of renunciation good will and harmlessness

162
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,000
and what three things have they cultivated thoughts of sensuality ill will and

163
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,640
cruelty and then of course the converse i feel comfortable going to a place

164
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:13,679
where the people live in harmony appreciating each other without quarreling blending like milk and water

165
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:19,600
and regarding each other with kindly eyes let alone just thinking about it

166
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:27,440
i come to a conclusion about them clearly those people have given up three things and cultivated three things

167
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,279
what three things have they given up thoughts of sensuality ill will and cruelty

168
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:39,120
and what three things have they cultivated thoughts of renunciation letting go as

169
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:46,080
good will and harmlessness so non-attachment to

170
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:53,519
various pleasures of the senses helps other people it helps us live in harmony

171
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,600
just as much as will and non-cruelty do

172
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:06,960
so caring about relationship and communal harmony is one aspect of what i've been calling

173
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,919
this week the more elevated human desires and the happiness that these kinds of

174
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:22,159
desires bring could be called the happiness of letting go which is kind of our topic for today

175
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,279
the happiness of letting go so we talked previously about how the

176
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:33,519
buddha emphasized the disadvantages of sense pleasures in rather stark terms i read a

177
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,440
bunch of those images a couple of days ago and i know that they were maybe a little

178
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,360
bit surprising and how strong they were you know things like

179
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,480
a dog gnawing on a meatless bone and not getting any satisfaction from it things

180
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,919
like that and i pointed out that probably he wanted to wake us up from our

181
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,919
dream world of trying to secure our happiness through getting things that are not very

182
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:08,720
reliable and not really in our control but the good the good news i mean that's

183
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:15,919
good news too that he wanted to wake us up like that but the other good news is that uh the buddha had kind of a dual

184
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:22,878
strategy so he talked about how ultimately unsatisfying sense pleasures are and he

185
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:28,560
also talked about the happiness and bliss that come from these more elevated

186
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:35,760
pleasures and those pleasures become available when we are willing to give up material

187
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,320
and sensual forms of enjoyment and that doesn't mean that we're not going to have them and we give up the attachment

188
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,679
to them right so but it's you know we we're so entangled sometimes it's hard to see

189
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:54,158
where the attachment is and where the direct pleasure is but so it doesn't mean you need to get

190
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:00,240
rid of all your stuff and you know live in grim austerity but we have to give up the attachment to those

191
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:08,160
things or we can't experience these higher forms of happiness so it says in the dhammapada

192
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,240
if by giving up a lesser happiness one could experience greater happiness

193
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,839
a wise person would renounce the lesser to behold the greater

194
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:26,240
do you agree so the word here for that's translated as lesser

195
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:33,680
uh is a not a very clear word exactly what it means and it could also be interpreted as material

196
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:40,960
and some translations actually say it that way i read gil's translation so whether or not that word literally

197
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,320
means material i think that's a fair interpretation of the meaning of this verse

198
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:53,280
so that material happinesses are lesser and then you know say spiritual happinesses are greater

199
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,400
so you know it's it's not a difficult trade-off which is the greater happiness

200
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,480
getting some kind of food that you want or creating a good relationship with your partner

201
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,640
some kind of material gain or being honest you know when when the choice is made

202
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:17,440
then the trade-off is made that way it seems obvious so one of the things that we start

203
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:24,560
seeing as we cultivate beautiful qualities of the heart and mind that is when we value them when we

204
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,839
desire to increase them there is desire behind cultivation

205
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:35,359
so one of the things that we see is that sensual happiness has a kind of built-in

206
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:41,839
limitation to it so let's say i i'm enjoying an apple

207
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:47,520
and if i eat that apple no one else can eat that apple that's just how it works

208
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,640
in the material world but if i experience the happiness of say

209
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,920
being honest it doesn't interfere with anybody else's happiness there's an

210
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,960
infinite supply of these kinds of more elevated pleasures

211
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,839
which is a good thing you know it just works differently in that realm right

212
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,320
so let's move on to some other aspects of these elevated pleasures

213
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,079
the buddha was a teacher of the full eightfold path and he also highlighted that the

214
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:28,640
happiness of meditative development is a much deeper kind of happiness than

215
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,920
various sensual happinesses sometimes the ordinary pleasures that we

216
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,680
experience are called the five chords of sensual pleasure that's just the phrase

217
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,880
that's used in the teachings so things that are enjoyable sights and sounds and

218
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,720
smells tastes touches and there's a teaching i'm reading a lot from the

219
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:57,119
pseudos today it seems where the buddha says should anyone say

220
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,480
the five chords of sensual pleasure are the utmost pleasure and joy that human

221
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,640
beings experience i would not concede that to them why is that

222
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,160
because there is another kind of pleasure that is loftier and more sublime than that pleasure

223
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:21,280
and what is that secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a practitioner

224
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:28,160
enters and abides in the first genre and then it goes on to other levels of concentration so that's

225
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:36,000
referring to deep states of meditation but really it could be any state of meditation where the mind has let go of

226
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,119
wanting and not wanting somewhat like what we did in the guided meditation

227
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:49,119
so it's interesting that it says that the precondition for meditative composure of mind let's say

228
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,640
is seclusion from sensual pleasures and unwholesome states

229
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:02,240
so once again we have to give up those pleasures in order to experience meditative calm and unification

230
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,079
and in that case on wholesome states refers to the five entrances

231
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:15,200
which are a different list so one of the other uses of this term

232
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,440
necoma that we talked about yesterday the word that's usually translated as renunciation but could also be letting

233
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,280
go is giving up distraction in meditation that's another way that it's used in the

234
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,320
buddhist teachings so that the mind can find ease and calm

235
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,760
letting go of stories and rumination and thinking about our views

236
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,599
is also part of renunciation as the buddha meant that term

237
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:49,680
there's a story of a man who comes to the buddha and he says that he understands he's a practice long time

238
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,359
practitioner and says that he understands that great and hatred and delusion are the main problems in the

239
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,880
human mind and he definitely wants not to go in that direction but that he

240
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:07,839
still gets overcome by desire for sense pleasure sometimes and he asks the buddha why that is

241
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:13,920
and the buddha says oh it's it's easy it's because you don't know a better form of happiness

242
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,240
so it happened that that that practitioner had not deeply experienced any alternative to

243
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:27,119
sense pleasure so in that case you know the buddha didn't tell the man about all the dangers and

244
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:33,599
terrible problems that come from sense pleasures he didn't give him all those images that i read the other day

245
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:40,160
he simply said there are better forms of happiness but you haven't cultivated them yet so of course you're not willing

246
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,640
to give up sensuality so he he points toward the toward the positive and sense toward the

247
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:53,119
other forms of happiness so this makes sense humans are not going to give up

248
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,960
happiness we're very strongly drawn to happiness and we have a natural desire for

249
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,319
happiness if i could say it that way so the buddha used this desire for

250
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,640
well-being and peace and freedom that we have and we wish to be free of the pain of

251
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,920
great hatred and delusion he used that to encourage us on the path

252
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,920
he encouraged creating harmonious relationships being ethical being caring

253
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,720
and developing the mind and meditation and all of these are these loftier forms of pleasure

254
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:35,839
so we're actually meant to experience to fully take in this happiness that is not

255
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:41,440
sensual we don't need to be just neutrally mindful all the time

256
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:48,480
it's good to feel joy and contentment and ease and peace to whatever degree they're available in a moment and even

257
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:55,440
if the moment is unpleasant you know even if we have a bodily pain of some kind or in a

258
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,640
situation that's challenging it is always possible to have a slight

259
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,720
joy in the mind simply from being mindful of that i know i've experienced that i've had

260
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,240
the sense when mindfulness was there of wow this is really unpleasant but

261
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:18,079
i'm glad to be knowing it i would rather know it than not know it

262
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,520
so another quote this is the bliss of renunciation the

263
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,720
bliss of seclusion the bliss of peace the bliss of enlightenment

264
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,839
i say of this kind of pleasure that it should be pursued that it should be

265
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,520
developed that it should be cultivated and that it should not be feared

266
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,680
how about that the buddha says this kind of bliss should not be feared head straight into it

267
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:51,280
the bliss of renunciation and the bliss of peace and the more that we experience these

268
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:58,480
higher forms of happiness actually the less attractive sensual pleasures become we look back at those

269
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,560
from some other place and we wonder why we invested so much in them

270
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,240
so our desires shift over time over the course of the path

271
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:16,079
more and more often we find ourselves wanting ease peace harmony awareness

272
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,520
wisdom sometimes people are a little bit surprised that something that used to be

273
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,560
enjoyable for them now feels a little bit coarse there's a

274
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:32,319
refinement and also a lightening up of the mind it's actually a bit of a relief to let

275
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:38,800
go of the more stressful forms of pleasure and this is also a way of healing you

276
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,839
know healing of the mind and heart we live with more well-being and we're

277
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:50,960
more often able to care for others more fully when we've started to let go of these

278
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:57,520
busier more stressful forms of of pleasure so the happiness of letting go i would

279
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:05,760
say is one of the great discoveries on the buddhist path and it draws us along the path further

280
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,440
and at some point we will feel the desire to move on even from these

281
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:18,880
states of well-being because the deepest stirring in the heart is the desire for complete freedom

282
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:26,400
which is what we will touch into a bit tomorrow so thank you for this ongoing journey

283
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,960
and i hope to see you then
