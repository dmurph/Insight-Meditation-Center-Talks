1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,559
so here you are

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:19,920
you're all each of you is there and you're here here spot your spot for

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,840
being here and i think we should never

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:33,680
overlook the hereness of this moment the hereness of where we

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,399
are and where we're going to meditate to be here

6
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:49,760
not as a coincidence not as something to overlook not as something that is insignificant

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,399
but rather here is the most important place for this

8
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:04,640
moment for this meditation and so to assume a posture

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,680
for being here

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,520
to be rooted to this place and to this time

11
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,840
and to feel the connection of your body to this location

12
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:37,280
the way your the weight of your body is received by whatever

13
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,320
body that's that in a sense stops the pull of

14
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,398
gravity that keeps you in this location

15
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:01,759
and to adjust the body a bit especially it's nice to adjust it so the

16
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:09,520
breathing can be a freer more relaxed more open without

17
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,080
getting tense and without straining maybe it's something you can do with a

18
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,879
spine that frees up the front of the torso so

19
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,800
the breathing can be more easeful maybe sitting up a little

20
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:37,840
straighter in the spine

21
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,840
and then to

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,400
see if you can take some deeper breaths that are enjoyable for you to take

23
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,920
so maybe for you it's to do just a little bit deeper than

24
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:19,840
what you're already doing or maybe doing it slowly

25
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,879
maybe the feeling of depth or fullness of breathing is done more in the belly or more in the

26
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,599
top of the chest or middle of the chest

27
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:41,360
or maybe the sense of enjoyable fuller deeper breathing

28
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,840
is a more subtle expansion of the back ribcage

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,080
or maybe there's something pleasant about in a deep full breath the gentle

30
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:14,879
pressure downward as you breathe in

31
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,440
the diaphragm pushes down and pushes down the intestines and

32
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,560
innards there and perhaps

33
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:43,840
that pushing down a gentle pushing down is a grounding here to this spot

34
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,199
and as you exhale is there any place in your body that would be

35
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:10,479
kind of pleasant or enjoyable to relax or soften

36
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:18,800
instead of maybe pleasant or enjoyable any place in your body as you exhale

37
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,840
it would be nice to relax

38
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

39
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:07,840
and take a few breaths to familiarize yourself with your breathing

40
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:35,840
noticing the places in your body that move the most as you breathe

41
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:49,840
and where there's movement in the breathing but the movement is just light

42
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,639
and then once again to take a few deeper breaths gently

43
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,000
quietly not too much

44
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,880
if if it happens to be that you feel some resistance or holding

45
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,759
back at the top of the in-breath

46
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:45,280
see if you can relax around that place of holding resistance not ambitiously

47
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:52,639
but more as a expression of kindness to yourself and

48
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,840
a willingness to relax there

49
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:14,160
and at the end of the exhale is there also some holding back

50
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:21,759
and if so can you relax and release the end of the exhale

51
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,840
maybe the exhale is a little bit longer

52
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,920
and then again letting the breathing return to normal

53
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,320
and feel your breathing now perhaps by letting the thinking mind

54
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,720
become quieter it allows you to have more attention

55
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:09,839
when feeling the body breathing

56
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:32,959
and then ever so gently maybe just very slightly

57
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,279
within the range of what could be considered normal breathing see if there's some simple

58
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,160
ways to adjust your breathing to make it more pleasant

59
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,240
a little bit slower a little bit faster

60
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,560
a little fuller

61
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:08,079
a little bit more shallow and a smaller breath

62
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:22,320
maybe you find it a little bit more pleasant to breathe more fully into the belly or more fully into the

63
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,800
chest

64
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,120
or to really focus on the sensations of air going in and out through the

65
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,120
nostrils and notice

66
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:59,600
if if there is any feelings of pleasure or pleasantness in the breathing

67
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:07,839
that it's pleasant to breathe maybe not so much your effort to breathe

68
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,720
but the sensations are in the body of breathing

69
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:22,240
is there anything about them that feels pleasant enjoyable or comforting

70
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,839
it can be very slight

71
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,279
any small ways you can adjust around your breathing

72
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:51,680
maybe by being aware of a smaller little spot in your body where it's most pleasant

73
00:11:51,680 --> 00:12:00,639
or maybe it's a broad awareness of the body breathing over a larger spot or the whole

74
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:15,440
torso and then as you exhale

75
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:24,000
relax your body more and in order to settle into your breathing

76
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,920
settling in to be with your breathing

77
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:39,839
for these minutes we're together

78
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:54,399
and if your mind wanders off in thought when you begin again with your breathing

79
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:01,920
spend a few breaths re-establishing

80
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,839
an enjoyable breath the pleasant breathing

81
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,440
even if it's just one little piece of the cycle of breathing

82
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,959
or maybe just reestablish a breathing which is a

83
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:25,600
little bit feels a little bit better than what you were doing

84
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:34,880
every time the mind wanders off spend a little bit of time

85
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:49,839
reconnecting to whatever is good about breathing in and breathing out

86
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:45,839
let the thinking mind become quieter so you can be in your body more

87
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,160
feeling the embodied experience of

88
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
breathing

89
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:55,839
can you relax your belly as you breathe

90
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:10,800
maybe it's more present pleasant to breathe to breathe a little bit further behind

91
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,519
to feel the area just little bits in the back of where you feel breathing

92
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,959
not so much exactly in the center of your breathing area

93
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,680
but kind of like the little bit in the back of it

94
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,560
just behind it or in the back side of it so that maybe there's a little bit less sense of

95
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,800
control or there's a lighter [Music]

96
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:51,839
more delicate feeling of breathing

97
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:30,080
and while you're focusing on breathing so your central vision central awareness

98
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,559
is on breathing peripherally see if you can allow the

99
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:42,320
to have the body be allowing receptive

100
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:50,880
the body is open willing to experience

101
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,039
the influence of breathing

102
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,840
it's kind of like breathing

103
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,159
is a gentle wind

104
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,480
that spreads its influence across the

105
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,960
body or a light that's been turned on that

106
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,159
glows outwards

107
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:31,760
letting the body be receptive allowing for whatever

108
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,799
influence the focus on breathing might have

109
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:43,280
not looking for something particular just available

110
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:57,840
with breathing at the center

111
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:57,760
um quietly receiving the bodies breathing

112
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:12,158
and perhaps breathing within within whatever larger

113
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:21,600
context of pleasure or joy or contentment there might be

114
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,240
whatever larger feeling of wholeness

115
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:39,360
calmness so breathing is at the center of a wider field

116
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,720
of goodness wholeness settledness

117
00:20:47,200 --> 00:21:03,840
pleasure joy happiness

118
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:14,640
the thinking mind becomes quieter so attention can better

119
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:21,600
feel and sense the fullness of the

120
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,600
the way breathing spreads its influence out into the

121
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,840
goodness around it

122
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:45,840
the wholeness around it

123
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:23,039
and there might be ways that you do not feel calm or do not feel pleasure

124
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:32,159
that you're uncomfortable it's okay but there might also be in

125
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,360
addition to that around it underneath it in the middle of

126
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:44,240
it somewhere the opposite feelings

127
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,279
a wholeness a calmness that holds it all

128
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:55,919
lorry can accept it all

129
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:05,799
an ability to stay gently aware of the breathing the rhythm of breathing so you're not

130
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:12,000
preoccupied by the discomfort it can be there but let it be just a

131
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,840
piece of the picture in the background you just breathing

132
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:28,559
and then sitting here quietly at the end of this meditation

133
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,278
is there anything that feels

134
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:46,480
more settled for you calmer for you having done this

135
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:55,039
meditation in some way or other do you feel

136
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:03,840
better than you were when you started the meditation

137
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,559
and if you do

138
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,600
if you if you would like you could offer

139
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,840
the goodness of your meditation how you're calmer more settled

140
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:39,200
maybe even a little happier peaceful offer that

141
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:46,000
for the welfare and happiness of others or dedicate it

142
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:53,840
let it be dedicated in some way or other that you use that

143
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,960
that it's the basis for benefiting the world out into the

144
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:09,600
world may it be a force may it be a avenue

145
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:19,919
support for bringing greater comfort and peace calm joy

146
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:28,559
love into the world and may we

147
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,480
do that a little bit actively not just as a wish

148
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:40,000
but as an inspiration for

149
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,240
being concerned for the welfare of others

150
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,739
may it be [Music]

151
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:59,360
that this meditation is dedicated to the welfare and happiness of others

152
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,320
may all beings be happy

153
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,480
may all beings be safe

154
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,519
may all beings

155
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:26,320
be free may all beings be peaceful

156
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:37,840
and may our love and our care support that possibility

157
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,579
[Music]

158
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:08,480
so i thought that before kind of going further with anapanasati with this

159
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,720
practice of mindfulness of breathing to kind of uh kind of start over again

160
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,480
in a little bit way if maybe a little different way and stay more with the basic

161
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:27,039
most basic aspect of the practice and over these weeks that i've been doing this i've offered

162
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:33,519
a variety of maybe subtly different ways of being with the breath and breathing and different ways

163
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:39,440
different little different little different each time it isn't that you have to remember all

164
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,080
those ways and and uh but rather maybe some of them

165
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,320
work for you inspire you in some way and it can be a basis of how you

166
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:59,679
practice and so the wider range that i give perhaps the more likely you'll find something

167
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,799
you'll piece together parts of it the subtle different ways of being with the breathing and work with

168
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:12,159
the breathing and the meditation and breath and um and i also wanted to kind of just

169
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,679
stay real basic today rather rather than moving further along the steps

170
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:23,600
as i said yesterday in some ways as we're going through slowly in some ways we're going through it very fast and

171
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,679
you know maybe it'd be ideal to spend a year going through the steps

172
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:35,760
and um and so uh it's on monday you know we'll start and

173
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,159
i'll go a little bit further and the next stages of the next steps of it are quite fascinating or very very

174
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:48,080
significant for this working with this meditation practice but before we

175
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,480
go on that way i wanted to um

176
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,640
maybe take some questions from you we've been doing this breath meditation now for a few weeks

177
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:07,679
and maybe it'll be nice if you had a chance a few of you had a chance to ask some questions and and if you can put them in the chat and

178
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:15,039
then i'll try to respond and maybe uh the questions that i pick out of the

179
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:21,519
chat uh hopefully they are relevant for many of you and be interesting to kind of have some at

180
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:28,399
least interesting for me to get some feedback or some hearing about learning a little bit about the kind of questions you have or

181
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,519
challenges you have with it or joys you have with it or something

182
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,519
and the um and the ways you know if there are a lot

183
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,039
of chat questions uh sometimes i can't really follow them in order and they're in place

184
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:50,159
because they passed by so quickly and i i try to do a little bit that way but

185
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:57,440
maybe we can think of it more as i'm pulling questions out of the hat than than uh and doing it in sequence

186
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:05,200
and um so someone said i experienced anxiety

187
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:12,878
um and um there's no question but it's interesting that anxiety um is a

188
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:19,440
i think it comes from a greek word to choke and like choke to not really be able to breathe fully in

189
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,480
so this kind of working the edge of where the breathing is held or resisted

190
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,358
or is sometimes can be helpful with anxiety

191
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:37,440
kind of expanding it relaxing that how can this help with the severe

192
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,040
chronic pain the um it might not help

193
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,280
i mean i can't promise you that this will help there are plenty of people who find that

194
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,480
breath meditation helps can help with severe pain certainly i've had lots of

195
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,960
severe pain in meditation but not chronic but certainly severe at times and

196
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:07,200
one of the surprises is to discover that it's possible to feel joy and pain at the same time it's

197
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:13,599
possible to have become and feel pain at the same time it's kind of like two different sides two different parts different aspects of

198
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,800
the of our being and often if we identify too much with a pain or we

199
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:26,160
too preoccupied with it or too caught up in it then that influences kind of the inner

200
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,240
state of how we are but if we don't identify two with it or aren't too preoccupied with it it's

201
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,680
there and we don't ignore it um but um then their inner interstate

202
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,599
inner state of our emotional state our mood and all that doesn't have to be tied to it and so the

203
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,880
interstate can be peaceful or calm and that doesn't necessarily make the pain go away

204
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:56,079
but it creates a different context for being with the pain so that the pain isn't the primary

205
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,440
influence on us but there's some other something inside which is an influence that might actually influence the pain

206
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,839
in some way i've also when i've had severe pain

207
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:14,800
in meditation or in life i sometimes have um i just breathe through it and around the

208
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:22,400
place of pain and it depends a little bit probably what kind of pain it is but uh sometimes uh just breathing

209
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,599
through it and and or with it i don't identify with it so much and there's a little

210
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:33,520
little sense of relaxation a little sense of something releases then and and if nothing what releases is that my

211
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:42,000
preoccupation with it there's much more to be said about pain but for now have you experienced all 16

212
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,599
sure and sometimes i've experienced them

213
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,960
sequentially one to the other usually but sometimes it's more random you know sit down to meditate

214
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,880
and i find myself some points different points of the of the steps or i'll jump ahead or seems

215
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,000
like go through it quickly and and one of the steps becomes more the predominant one for the day

216
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,599
and um so so you know but yeah um

217
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:20,240
oh what does it mean when the body disappears and there's no question mark so if that's already disappeared too

218
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,480
generally when the body disappears in meditation it means we're concentrated it means the the thinking mind has

219
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,520
become quiet quiet enough that um that we're not conceptualizing

220
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,520
about the body it turns out that it's a little hard to imagine you know if you have never experienced it

221
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,760
but it turns out that a lot of the ways in which we experience the body is mediated through our thoughts and

222
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:52,640
ideas through the activity of the mind that constructs the body and so uh

223
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,920
so for example with eyesight i'm seeing we all these little photon light

224
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:08,720
particles travel into the eye they get turned upside down in the eye and go against the retina and

225
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,240
and then there's these electrical signals the nerves that send these signals up into the brain and

226
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:21,040
then the brain reconstructs the signals into something which is a simile of the

227
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,640
world out there the world that was seen and sometimes that reconstruction is not accurate

228
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:33,200
as when you know you see a twig on the ground and you first you see it as a snake and um

229
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,560
or i've seen people in the distance in a crowd strangers but uh for a moment i thought it was a

230
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:44,640
friend of mine because there was enough similarity and then i filled in the blank to kind of see my friend and then i looked more

231
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,839
carefully no it's not my friend so the reconstruction process is is an

232
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:56,240
activity the mind does as the mind gets calmer it's not reconstructing so much

233
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:03,040
and as it doesn't reconstruct it doesn't it's not taking the signals or doesn't have the signals from the body

234
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,839
uh to reconstruct and it just um and it feels like the body is disappearing and um and sometimes it disappears

235
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,839
entirely and i've actually sometimes thought you know i had to open my eyes in meditation to

236
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:21,839
make sure that i was still here because it just felt so you know empty

237
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:27,200
sometimes there's an intermediate stage where we're still the mind is still

238
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,280
reconstructing uh sensations but it's not really doing it accurately anymore

239
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,720
and so sometimes people's uh in meditation they'll feel really like they get elongated like they're about to

240
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:46,079
touch the ceiling or they feel really squat their hands feel like they're getting really big usually it's not particularly

241
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:51,839
you know you know you know unusual it's just kind of little

242
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:57,520
perceptual distortion and it's usually a particular stage and then when people go deep just it also

243
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,839
doesn't last for too long and then after a while the capacity to settle and get more concentrated settles in and

244
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:11,359
and that perceptual distortion stops um

245
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:18,160
is it important to follow the steps uh in order um like i just said no sometimes it's

246
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,760
helpful to do so because it it can't help the concentration just you're on task

247
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,680
and you're just going to do it and sometimes it's not to do it on tasks and do a technique and kind of follow

248
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:35,359
something makes the mind too busy and and sometimes what happens is we

249
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:40,480
start with the first one we just start with breath meditation and getting settled in and then rather

250
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,319
than following this you know implying and following the steps exactly we are

251
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:52,480
we're recognizing as we deepen the practice we recognize the steps we recognize where we are

252
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,520
and because we can recognize it maybe it becomes a little fuller and we can let it become fuller and more

253
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,920
complete and then it just on its own it moves into the next step into the next step and i prefer

254
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,119
that way rather than kind of intentionally moving ahead when you know it's a time to move ahead now

255
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:16,079
it's more like you do your practice and you just kind of allow it to unfold in its own way and

256
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,839
sometimes it jumps around it doesn't have to be the same linear steps

257
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:30,079
how to work with controlling breath this is really common the i think the

258
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:37,920
the most useful thing to do is um not worry about it and

259
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:46,000
don't be bothered by it allow yourself to have a controlled breath and and you can cultivate just a strong

260
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,240
mindfulness and concentration with a controlled breath with the breath that's not controlled

261
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,400
it's not the breath that is the main issue it's really the main issues the quality of the attention you bring

262
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,240
also if you're not bothered with it you're more likely to get out of its way when we're bothered by a controlled

263
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,960
breath we actually in some subtle way reinforce it and it makes it more difficult to let go

264
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,280
also it can be very interesting to become a connoisseur of the controlled breath just be content to have a

265
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:24,400
controlled breath and then get to know it really well like where exactly is the sense of control where's the tightness the resistance

266
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,160
the pushing what are the emotions that are connected to it are there anything anything emotional

267
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,599
any beliefs connected to it just really get to know it inside and out and sometimes that

268
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:43,599
really getting to know it sometimes is a little trick because after a while focusing on that way directly kind of uh

269
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:50,800
disarms the control and sometimes you discover something interesting that needs to be relaxed and released then then it

270
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,160
becomes easier to to to do it so that's one of the things i would do

271
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,920
another thing that i've done you know i've done so much of this over the years that i've depending on times i've done different

272
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,319
things sometimes with that when i had a controlled breath uh i imagine that uh i was bringing my

273
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:14,480
attention uh from the back forward like going in through the back door my back rib cage and just feeling it in

274
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,640
the back rib cage where there's very little sense of control in the back ribcage and i felt the breath there for a while

275
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:27,359
and then that kind of relaxed the control in the front and then i slowly moved my attention forward gingerly

276
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,520
without kind of triggering the control

277
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,839
um

278
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,520
i have a challenge in the out breath smaller and belly tight your suggestion

279
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:59,760
observing the end of the in-breath at the end of the out breath is helpful since i

280
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,960
do get anxious there so any thoughts about that

281
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,280
i think a little bit same as with the control you know it's it's very very significant just simply to

282
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:17,200
recognize and observe what we're actually doing and um and there's a tendency when we

283
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,240
see something about ourselves to have judgments or reactions or think it should be different

284
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,359
but don't underestimate how very significant it is that you're just observing it and seeing it

285
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,960
and it might be all you need to do and i've had all kinds of ways in which you know i've been anxious

286
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,200
or tight in my breathing controlling my breathing all kinds of things about it

287
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,400
that i just allowed myself to feel it know it and there's continued with the breathing

288
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,760
kind of like the breathing is just a massage for it and i find it interesting that as a

289
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,960
massage some point in the in-breath is more like the

290
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,480
the heart of the massage and then like pushing it and then relaxing sometimes the top of the in-breath

291
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:07,200
sometimes the end of the out breath depends what's going on and just kind of like be with the rhythm be and and find a way

292
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:13,200
to be really content like you're in it for the long term like you're not trying to fix it you're not

293
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:18,319
you know pretty concerned about it not just okay just recognize oh

294
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:24,720
i'm you know it's uh it's unpleasant it's tight it's controlled there's anxiety and i just

295
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,119
breathe with it you know and we're going to be friends and just breathe and breathe and that kind of attitude sometimes is a

296
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:38,800
very effective way to over time the things just settle without us being involved in all kinds of mental

297
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:46,960
uh preoccupations and that often just kind of stir it up even more sometimes

298
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,800
um yes let's do another zoom soon to chat

299
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:59,119
with sangha yeah we'll do it maybe we can do it next week it depends a little bit about you know it depends

300
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:06,000
whether i have time and right now i have a number of

301
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,400
uh it thinks i'm having to take care of my

302
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,400
life that makes it a little harder

303
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:24,560
any idea for trauma survivors and disassociation sometimes i may think i'm concentrated maybe i'm

304
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:30,079
disassociated yeah i mean certainly

305
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:36,240
uh trauma survivors have their own path and and the care that's needed for

306
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,359
breath meditation and for meditation in general and it's a it's a noble path it's a

307
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:46,400
dignified path for people who've had trauma to work through and work with

308
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,599
their trauma in meditation and and all that but it often needs a little different

309
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:58,640
kind of attention than the kind of the basic usual you know instructions that i would give

310
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,359
the um the you know it usually what's really

311
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:10,560
good is a lot of compassion and a lot of care a lot of generosity to oneself

312
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:17,119
and a lot of patience with it all and and permission to not have to go

313
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:23,200
headlong into the trauma or the fear or something it's fine to be at the edges of it and

314
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,400
and and it's fine to avoid it if uh or it's fine to breathe with it without

315
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:34,880
fixing it or doing anything with it um so you can find exactly or to pull out

316
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,000
when trauma responses arises in meditation a very helpful skill to develop

317
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
is to kind of end the meditation or kind of come out of that state and revive

318
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,040
oneself or come back to normal a little bit and develop that skill so there's

319
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,559
confidence that as you go into it that you if you ever if you really wanted to you could come

320
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:01,760
out so at some point if you want to explore and go further with the sensations

321
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,800
of trauma that you do so with a lot of confidence that at a moment's notice you can pull

322
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,839
yourself out and um and maybe there is this

323
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:19,040
association and sometimes you know it's not there's not a you know it's not a it's not nothing you know not

324
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:25,520
a crime to be disassociated so it's okay to within reason and

325
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:32,240
and so if it just happens in meditation maybe it also has an uh helpful function sometimes there's a break or

326
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:38,240
there is a kind of relaxation that can happen with some disassociation so not to be in a hurry to make it wrong to

327
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:43,760
do that and then um but if it starts being a problem or you suspect that

328
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,520
it is a problem then um you know the the really the focus focus

329
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:55,760
on the body i find is one way to kind of work through disassociation because dissociation is very

330
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,359
more often than not i associate it with not being connected to the body

331
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:05,838
and um so um

332
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,640
and then getting professional help i think is good if you really think it's a big issue it's really good to find a professional

333
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:18,480
help nah there are now in some areas you know therapists who know about

334
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:24,319
mindfulness and buddhism and meditation and you know that can be particularly helpful

335
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:31,200
for people meditating um

336
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:37,680
after the 16th step this would be the last one after the 16 steps would you make letting go the next theme yeah that that

337
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:43,760
certainly can be uh the but we'll see it letting go is built into the anapanasati

338
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:50,079
and so next week we'll get to the end of each tetrad there is some quality of letting go in

339
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:58,559
the family of letting go and so we'll see next week when we get to the eighth step that has letting go and the first step

340
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:04,880
uh the end the first tetrad is relaxing or tranquilizing the bodily formations and that's that's

341
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,920
in the family of letting go and so at the end of each tetrad there's a letting go kind of uh

342
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:16,319
quality so we'll do some of that here well thank you for your questions and

343
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:21,680
i'll read the rest of the questions and so i get some sense of your concerns and

344
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:28,240
and i appreciate this chance to be this way with you and i look forward

345
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,599
to next week and continuing on this process

346
