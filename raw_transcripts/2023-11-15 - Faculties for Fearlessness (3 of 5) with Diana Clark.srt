1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:07,120
welcome welcome everybody it's lovely to be here very

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:15,520
lovely to be here going to be continuing on our exploration of these faculties for

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,199
fearlessness vectors of faculties for fearlessness for

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:28,320
freedom I don't know it's just getting a kick out of this

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,360
alliteration we'll start with a just a simple um guided meditation

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,079
so settling

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,320
in just bringing our attention and our

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,520
body to meditation whatever posture feels

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:01,920
comfortable and is available to you right now

10
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:11,000
and is there a way that the posture could be just a little bit more

11
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:18,560
comfortable for me it's bringing a little bit more uprightness to the spine

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:28,720
so that the limbs can just hang from the spine letting the shoulders just

13
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:36,079
relax and tucking the chin backwards just this

14
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,119
tiny tiny bit it allows the neck to be a

15
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,280
little bit more aligned with the

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,560
spine for you some other tiny adjustments might be

17
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
needed

18
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,000
and then let's open the senses bring awareness to

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,840
the senses if your eyes are closed just

20
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,319
notice if there's any Shadows or

21
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,040
patterns behind the eyelids nothing in particular needs to

22
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,360
be happening we're just

23
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,519
noticing and the ears noticing the sounds

24
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,640
the sound of my voice other sounds you might

25
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:12,159
[Music] hear just allowing them to be

26
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:21,200
received we don't have to go out and get the sounds just opening to

27
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,280
them they're welcome

28
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:36,080
too there might be scents or

29
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,080
tastes sometimes it's more difficult when we're sitting in meditation but it

30
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,720
might be coffee

31
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,840
toothpaste

32
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
tea

33
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,159
and then the sense of touch noticing where the body is

34
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,439
contacting whatever it is contacting whichever

35
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:25,440
surface whether it's the cushion or chair couch

36
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,600
bed feeling the pressure against the body

37
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:56,639
feeling the contact we're

38
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,440
here and this contact is the Foundation of our

39
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,000
posture feeling connected

40
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
grounded

41
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:42,360
and then noticing any obvious areas of tension in the

42
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,160
body resting awareness

43
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,000
there it might be that bringing awareness to the

44
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,599
tension allows a little bit of softening but it might not be also can

45
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,680
we be okay with

46
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:31,400
that maybe tension around the eyes or the jaw

47
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,120
neck

48
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,360
shoulders opening the chest just a tiny

49
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,960
bit the belly

50
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:31,319
softening back

51
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,440
legs again feeling the

52
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,599
contact

53
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
feet

54
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,400
arms

55
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,960
hands maybe sensing a sense of aliveness or presence

56
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,800
tingling vitality in the

57
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:58,880
hands can we be okay as best we can with however the

58
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,399
body is at this

59
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:34,120
moment and then resting the attention on the sensations of breathing

60
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,200
the movements the body does as it

61
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:49,000
breathes might feel it primarily in the chest stretching and the release of the

62
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,279
stretch and the belly moving out and

63
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,399
in or maybe the nose feeling the cool air go in and the

64
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:14,079
warmer air coming out just choosing one of those three

65
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,000
areas and resting the attention

66
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
there

67
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
e

68
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:45,800
and when the mind wanders as it's apt to do we don't have to make it be a problem

69
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:53,200
and just very simply gently begin again with the sensations

70
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:00,959
of breathing

71
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:12,360
and we do this movement back to the sensations of breathing with kindness

72
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,110
with warmth with [Music]

73
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
care

74
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:53,160
it doesn't matter how many times we have to return to the sensations of

75
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:00,480
breathing the practice is about returning

76
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,120
beginning

77
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,240
again don't worry about how many

78
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,160
times just Begin

79
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Again

80
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,049
[Music]

81
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,859
[Music]

82
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:14,339
[Music]

83
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,079
[Music]

84
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:41,679
morning good day good evening wherever you are whatever time it is welcome

85
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,960
welcome so today I'd like to continue with

86
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,200
this sense of the faculties for

87
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:59,880
fearlessness just want to recognize that you know fear I think we all know what fear Fe is but it shows up in our lives

88
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,440
in so many different ways maybe in some ways in which we're not really connecting with

89
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,640
fear and one of them is perfectionism this always like finding

90
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:17,159
flaws that need to be fixed before we can share something or show something

91
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:22,919
you know always trying to fix everything or maybe there's a sense of

92
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:28,880
like well I have to wait for when like I can't do something right now because

93
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,519
there has to be a time when things are more comfortable so maybe we're like holding

94
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:40,039
back something we want to do with our life or say to somebody or whatever it

95
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:46,399
might be start that more healthy Behavior or something like this or maybe

96
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:53,240
there's a way in which fear shows up in which we're trying to like avoid uncertainty we're trying to have

97
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:59,320
everything planned out beforehand or understand it and have it uh I don't

98
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,519
know being known in some kind of way this fear of the unknown so we're trying to make sure there aren't any unknowns

99
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,919
but you of course of course we can't be certain about

100
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:18,320
everything these are just some of the ways in which fear shows up it turns out to be such a big part of our

101
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:24,480
lives and then I'd like to offer these five days these five faculties many of

102
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,840
you will know this this is a very conventional list that we talk about in early Buddhism however I'm going to talk

103
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:38,080
about him a little bit differently that I'm not going to do it in the usual order and I'm going to highlight

104
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,760
particular aspects of each faculty that I think can be a real support for us to

105
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:53,919
bring to fear and just as a little brief summary I started with Sati and I'm uh highlighting this

106
00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:01,120
quality of noticing for Santi that is we first like notice maybe the

107
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,840
environment the desk the chair the computer this way we get

108
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:13,360
oriented then notice our present moment bodily experience the feeling of contact

109
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:20,639
with the whatever it is we're whatever surface we're in contact with maybe the

110
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:25,840
breath as I kind of lead us in these guided meditations I'm often doing this

111
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:33,679
movement but then also Santi to notice the sense of no I

112
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,039
don't want this fear or no I don't want to do this and maybe the fear is making

113
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:45,559
us wanting to do it the sense of resistance noticing that too often

114
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:50,840
they're conflated and confused and not even recognized but is there a way that

115
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:56,039
we can tease apart and know there's fear and resistance to

116
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:02,440
fear and then to go even more internal or

117
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,840
inside to notice what is it that's feeling

118
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,880
threatened do we have a self-concept a sense of what we think of

119
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:19,240
what it means to be a good person or what it means to be a good practitioner or a sense of how we think the world

120
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:25,159
should be and is that feeling threatened and to just notice that notice what's

121
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:33,159
feeling threatened so Sati is noticing from the more external to the more

122
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:39,960
internal some of you may know that sa is conventionally translated as

123
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:46,000
mindfulness and then the second that I did yesterday was about samadi and that was about bringing the sense of

124
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,240
collectedness centeredness this wholeheartedness like kind of like a a

125
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,399
gathering of our attention but in particular when we're

126
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:04,320
working with fear to bring this gness this abiding in to the resistance to the

127
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,398
fear not the fear itself often that's too overwhelming it's too much and

128
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:17,638
that's like so much we don't want to do this but the sense of no and we might have resistance to the

129
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:23,040
resistance that's okay bring uh this collectedness this gness about against

130
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,720
the resistance to the resistance or maybe we have resistance to the resistance to the resistance it's okay

131
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:35,358
whatever you know iteration that we have it to bring this collectedness this

132
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:43,118
scaredness around this sense of no I don't want it and no whatever way that shows up and

133
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,000
it shows up in a countless Myriad ways and then today I'd like to

134
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,638
introduce a third faculty and that is sadada German teachers often pronounce

135
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:04,119
it as Sada in paully it would be Sada but it's kind of like Dharma teacher paully it's a

136
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:09,960
Sada and that is that having practiced with Sati mindfulness and Som this

137
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,119
Gathering Together there can be this recognition that oh this uh noticing and

138
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:21,160
this gathering together is helpful the consequences of this it turns out to be

139
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,960
a little bit beneficial and we gain confidence in the practice we gain some

140
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,119
confidence in the approach that we're taking gain confidence with this sense

141
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:37,200
of having this presence of showing up for the fear and the resistance to the

142
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,920
fear and this confidence I'm going to say as sad

143
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:49,440
Sada and this confidence gives us strength to engage in this

144
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,560
practice to meet the fear to meet the resistance with the fear with the Sati

145
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:01,640
and Sam with the noticing and the collecting so this confidence in the practice that

146
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:10,079
there's some benefits to it noticing that there's some benefits and having this willingness to engage with the

147
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,799
practice but we also need not only confidence in the practice but confidence in

148
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,599
ourselves that we can do this and sometimes maybe this is a big

149
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:30,000
part of practice is to gain this confidence but which implies that we don't always have it I know that

150
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,480
certainly was true certainly beginning of my practice I just didn't think I couldn't do it it seemed like everybody

151
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:41,079
else could do it and they look like they had it all together and clearly they were enlightened or on the brink of

152
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:47,079
Enlightenment if they weren't already because they were sitting so still and here I was so Wiggly with my mind going

153
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:53,040
all over the place so if we don't have confidence in

154
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,760
ourselves we can borrow it borrow it from

155
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:06,079
others and this is part of the power of practicing with others practicing in sa

156
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,200
just like we do here at 7 amm these people that are leaving

157
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:18,119
comments right you're greeting one another but you're also kind of giving us confidence that like okay yeah you're

158
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:23,800
showing up again and again and again we can do it and by this warm-heartedness

159
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:30,160
that we see in the context in the comments we can see that oh okay the people that

160
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:37,760
are doing this are kindhearted well-wishing caring they have what we want the world

161
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,800
to be like we have they have what we want to be with

162
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,800
ourselves so if you feel like you don't have some confidence can you borrow the

163
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,440
confidence either from those here at the 7 a.m. maybe you have a meditation

164
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:01,800
center where you practice maybe you have a small group of friends that you practice with whomever maybe you have

165
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:09,440
teachers maybe you don't have like personal relationships where you know people but it's just you know of

166
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,839
people that's okay it's borrow the confidence wherever

167
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:21,240
you need to be inspired by other people but this coming back again and

168
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:28,200
again be inspired by the confidence they have in themselves or in you there's this way which this confidence and the

169
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:35,000
practice and the confidence that we can do this is contagious so allow yourself

170
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:43,480
to catch the confidence in some kind of way other people can believe in you and

171
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:49,359
believe in the practice even when you're feeling like you don't quite have it you're not

172
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:56,720
sure and here's part of the beauty about this idea of confidence is we only need

173
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:04,680
just enough confidence just enough just enough for

174
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:10,480
to be present for the next breath just enough to show up for the

175
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,960
next 7 a.m. or just enough confidence to not click

176
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:23,839
away just enough confidence to be curious about what's going to rise next

177
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:30,240
or curious about what's being pointed to when other people or the

178
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,280
teacher we do not need heroic confidence we do not need confidence that's

179
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:43,680
unshakable and we have it 100% of the time we just need enough for the next

180
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,520
moment s Sada is

181
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:56,079
confidence in the practice and in ourselves but I'd also like to introduce

182
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:04,200
a second aspect of Sada Sada and that is trust you could see how

183
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:10,560
these are related confidence and trust but there's this progression of

184
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:17,119
practice as we can like learn to be present and be carefully attentive and

185
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:23,200
maybe relax into what's happening we discover that there is more going on

186
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:29,760
within us and that there's this if we allow it there's this

187
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,800
movement towards healing towards

188
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:42,359
wholeness towards goodness we start to trust oh yeah if we

189
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:49,280
can create the conditions in which this can unfold there's this natural inner

190
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:57,200
process towards holess and freedom and it turns out we don't have

191
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:04,079
to make everything happen we don't have to insist or engineer manufacturer

192
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:12,079
create all the goodness the healing the freedom big part of practice is

193
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,599
trusting and this trust is part of what creates the condition for this wholeness

194
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:26,800
and healing to happen trust that Dharma practice enables and allows and makes room for

195
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:35,079
this natural process to happen maybe in the same way that when we have a cut or an injury right we have

196
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:43,560
to take care of it we have to clean the cut and put a Band-Aid on it or take

197
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:50,440
antibiotic if it's infected or do what the doctor suggests Physical Therapy whatever it is for whatever injury so we

198
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,880
definitely have to apply ourselves but there's also a way in

199
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:01,440
which right we don't actually do the healing it's a natural process that's

200
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,480
already happening we just have to help make it happen and so much about

201
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,800
practice turns out to be this this at some point what is needed

202
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,680
from us is just to get out of the way so I don't want to suggest that no effort is Ever Needed there is certainly effort

203
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,760
that is needed but it's not always this you know

204
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:30,839
really striving straining there's an effort to create

205
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:38,119
the conditions in which we can allow in which we can trust the depth of what is

206
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:44,960
possible within us the trust that this inner process

207
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,440
that's not only inside us that's inside others too we don't have to fix them we

208
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:57,240
don't have to try to heal them even though we want to of course we do but

209
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:02,559
they have this inner process too even though they may not know it but

210
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:08,200
is there a way that we can give space Not only to ourselves but to

211
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:15,760
others s Sada as confidence and trust is a way

212
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,800
that can help with the fear so even though it sometimes is

213
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:28,720
uncomfortable it requires a certain amount of letting go of a sense of control and part of the art of practice

214
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,839
is knowing when does there need to be some effort some real you know showing up

215
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:42,839
even though it's uncomfortable and when does there need to be some letting go some trusting and there's always a

216
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:48,640
combination maybe there's a little bit more effort and a little bit more letting go and trusting at other

217
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:55,400
times and this is that part of practice that as we more we practice the more we

218
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:00,720
start to rec recognize but maybe even hearing this word s

219
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,960
Sada confidence and Trust helps us to be sensitive of when that's already

220
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:12,359
unfolding in our own lives so the third faculty often

221
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:20,240
translated as Faith or confidence is s confidence trust in your process you

222
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:28,000
don't have to make it all happen thank you thank you

223
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,839
and wishing you all a wonderful rest of the

224
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,880
day
