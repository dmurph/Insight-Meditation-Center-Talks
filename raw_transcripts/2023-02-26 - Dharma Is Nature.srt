1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,940
oh good morning everyone and welcome to IMC

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:12,420
and um the only announcement I have before beginning the talk is that

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,820
um in two weeks and on April 12th we'll have

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,760
um a community meeting here at IMC in person it will have been just about

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,859
three years since we closed with the beginning of the pandemic and it seems

6
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,260
like a nice time to Mark where we're at and where we're going and kind of the

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:41,280
vision of things and the needs how they changed and anything else and um so anyway so it'll

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,520
happen after the sitting so I think maybe at 11 o'clock or so yeah

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,640
March 12th what did I say April sorry yes thank you very much so

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,300
March 12th in two weeks um and then in April somewhere around April that maybe April 12th or no end

11
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,119
sometime in April we'll have a online community meeting like that as well for

12
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:12,659
the online community which is quite large but it feels important also for the people who are local who come here to

13
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:20,479
have a meeting to talk about kind of the in-person dimensions of our community

14
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:27,720
and so please come and anybody's welcome to come I think for

15
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,780
March we're still following the protocol for covid that we're doing with people to sign up for Sunday morning but it

16
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,439
will um but for the 11 o'clock community meeting I think that's going to be open to anyone so maybe we'll have more

17
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:47,400
people uh we'll wear with masks inside but I think that we're getting into a period of time now I think they're also

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,100
seriously considering how to change our kind of covid protocol is it time to

19
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,380
change it and how to change it and then maybe I was thinking the beginning of

20
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,040
April but probably we'll do some kind of change and exactly what that change will be I don't know

21
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:11,879
I just came back from teaching in New Zealand and I was asked and uh and both to teach

22
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:18,959
a retreat there but also to teach for a evening sitting group and it was kind of fascinating to go from here

23
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,560
to there where just by no one was wearing masks and to sit in a big room like this you know

24
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,160
with no one almost nowhere again there were two people there game wearing masks it was quite different and so I don't

25
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,500
know if that marks anything for us in terms of our changes but I think that um

26
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,440
it's certainly time to discuss it and consider what you know step by step what we're going to do that's going to be

27
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,680
different and I thank you for all of you for wearing your masks here and some of you

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,080
probably don't see the need for it and I know that things have changed quite a bit but I appreciate very much that

29
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,959
we're still doing it and I think it does make a difference

30
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,400
so um

31
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,959
for this talk I would like to begin with a story that's attributed to the

32
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:20,640
Cherokee People and it's a story that circulated quite a bit right after nine at 9 11 and 9 11

33
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,640
you know September 11 2001 was a big deal and the impact and the

34
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,280
on this country and on the world was quite huge and the emotions were quite strong and

35
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,819
so the story circulated and had to do with a Cherokee grandfather and talking to his

36
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:44,959
grandson and he says there are two wolves

37
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,060
battling inside of us all one wolf

38
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:56,280
is angry and greedy and wants to destroy and has envy and conceit and all these

39
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,580
kinds of powerful negative forces that we can have inside of ourselves

40
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:08,519
and the other wolf has love care and generosity and

41
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:15,540
nurturing and all these positive forces that we can have so the grandson sits there quietly for a

42
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:23,160
couple of minutes taking this in and then says to the grandfather which one will win the battle

43
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,259
and the Grands and the grandfather says whichever one we feed

44
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:33,720
so that's the kind of strong message of this of the story whichever one we feed

45
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,080
that if we don't pay attention to what we're feeding that who knows what we're feeding we

46
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,600
might be inadvertently feeding the wrong wolf inside of us we might be doing

47
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,320
things that support to anger support greed support conceit rather than supporting being nurturing

48
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,099
and loving and generous and all these other kind of ways of being

49
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,840
and um so what's fascinating a little bit in comparison to Buddhism the story

50
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,320
that Buddhism kind of says the same thing but um but in the story there are two

51
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,440
kind of equal forces two wolves that are there and in Buddhism the similar kind of

52
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,639
processes in play within us I maybe not called it a battle but certainly a balancing act and of what has what gets

53
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:29,280
prominence for us but there are considered to be two radically different systems so then it

54
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,520
wouldn't be like two wolves I don't know what it would be um the the Buddha sometimes gives his

55
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,139
Lions Roar so I don't know if the difference between a lion and that hyena

56
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:47,639
within us I was trying to think of something a little bit nicer than that because lions are a little bit you know

57
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,919
carnivorous and so what is there so I was thinking

58
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:58,020
about maybe a whale I love whales the biggest mammals you know that are you

59
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:03,919
know and uh and a hyena so these two two different kind of animals within us

60
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,060
and uh we usually don't give prominence to our our whale you know to this

61
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,820
whatever that is and um so Buddhism also has these two different

62
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,860
forces and what's fascinating to me is that uh The Hub uh the characterizations

63
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,919
of these two different processes inside of us that the Buddha gives

64
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,319
and because it kind of speaks to how they're very different from each other

65
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:37,020
that um one of them the Buddha described as being artificial

66
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:43,560
being he used the word constructed but it's clearly constructed by the mind

67
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:50,039
in a way that's artificial meaning it's not part of the natural world the natural system of things

68
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,080
and we have the same kind of division in popular English between

69
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:02,340
um we talk about you know something that's been made artificially like artificial sugar versus what's in a

70
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:09,000
natural product are synthetic Plastics synthetic clothes versus you know something that's naturally made cotton

71
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,360
clothes for example and this distinguish between things that don't exist in nature on their own but

72
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,400
have but which are products of the human mind that have created and invented and

73
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,060
made something and uh you could argue that's natural as well but there's still a distinction

74
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,000
between what is um kind of uh human-made

75
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and has a source that is independent of what can be found on its own in the natural world

76
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,680
and so the Buddha kind of plays up that distinction and he uh he uses the word Sankara which

77
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,880
means constructed but the the idea of being constructed is that it's constructed in a way that's unnatural

78
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:00,060
it's part of a man a human-made kind of kind of uh invention construct that just

79
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:07,380
put together and in the ancient world the word Sankara could mean a cooking soup

80
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:13,259
cooking a meal constructing it preparing it it could also mean uh and I think this

81
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:21,840
is one of the plays that the Buddha had word plays he had it could refer to the construction of a brahmanical ritual

82
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,319
something rituals were actually called sankara's and um but a way of making them was

83
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:35,520
constructing them which that you know in contrasting themselves to this to the brahmanas the Buddha was focusing not on

84
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:42,120
what can be constructed by humans but a very different process so not these rituals that are made and built he

85
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:50,279
didn't put emphasis on that but on something else different the the image that's used in tibetan

86
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:57,180
tonkas Tibetan paintings of Buddhist paintings of this Sankara is a Potter

87
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:03,899
making a pot and it always seemed like a very nice image but here we have a something

88
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:10,620
that's humanely made something fragile that's the image of Sankara and so there's a humanly made is the important

89
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:18,360
uh distinction being here in the suit those teachings of the Buddha one of the images that's used for

90
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:26,279
becoming fully awakened is um a broken pottery shards

91
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:32,100
resting at the bottom of a very clear lake the the Clear Lake represents the

92
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:39,420
enlightened mind the enlightened awareness and somehow with a light Enlightenment the human constructed

93
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:47,940
categories beliefs conceits that we can live by have been shattered

94
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,220
and uh and they lay there peacefully on the pottery shards lay there on the on

95
00:09:53,220 --> 00:10:01,380
the bottom of the lake some of you know a very famous verse attributed to the Buddha where he

96
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:07,800
says that the point of his Enlightenment saying house Builder you have been seen

97
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,740
your rafters have been shattered have been destroyed

98
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,440
and I have attained the the destruction

99
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,320
and um and the word for Destruction is uh has again has the word Sankara in it

100
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,380
it's the destruction of the sankara's the construct the destruction of what's

101
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:38,220
been constructed and so it's not pointing to something which is unnatural in US

102
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,440
it's pointed to something which is an artifice that's a creation that's unnecessary

103
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,180
and some of you might go along with that that conceit for example that other people have

104
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:56,160
uh is uh you know kind of has an artificiality to it it's something

105
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,440
constructed and made up and you know it's it's like a little bit of oppressive and it's problematic

106
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,200
uh you could you know certainly make the argument that that's natural to it where else does it come from but you know

107
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,040
where does anything come from but the whole natural world everything's natural right but the distinction is between what is

108
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,380
an artifice just made by humans versus what comes from the natural world

109
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:25,440
so what is it that's part of the natural world that's this other system that the Buddha is talking about

110
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,079
and um and for that he uses very natural metaphors

111
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:37,680
to bring it forth or to kind of describe it and one fascinating one is

112
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:45,300
um is uh he has this little metaphor that's just a description of a hen

113
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:50,940
that has a whole bunch of eggs that she's sitting on incubating

114
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:58,380
and if she uh keeps them warm sits on them incubates them along then those

115
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,720
healthy eggs will certainly hatch they'll take and pick out pick their way

116
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,760
out of the shell soon enough uh and the Buddha says even if the hen

117
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,920
does not want them to hatch they will hatch

118
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:21,779
and so this idea that there's a natural process that doesn't require even the hens desire or mental you know wishes or

119
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:27,000
constructs it's just happening on its own and he said in the same way people

120
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
who practice well in the Dharma they don't have to even want to be enlightened

121
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,779
they will be they'll and he says they'll they will break through the shell or whatever that might be that

122
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:46,860
keeps us in so that's kind of a remarkable teaching about this practice that it's a natural

123
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:53,519
process like you're incubating something so um and uh and the Buddha says the same

124
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,700
thing and uh in a number of places and one of the places he says that um

125
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:05,639
if you really have uh endowed with or living in harmony with

126
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:12,839
or living out of the Eightfold Path you know fully then even if you don't

127
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:18,240
want to be enlightened you will become it's a powerful message about there's

128
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:25,019
something inside of us a natural process that's set in motion by certain conditions certain incubate incubating

129
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:31,380
support that's hears it's not something we have to huff and puff to get Enlightenment but it's something we

130
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:39,480
nurture we nourish it's a part of our nature that we nourish nurturing our nature to

131
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:46,680
allow something to grow and develop to unfold and but uses a lot of words from the

132
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:52,560
natural natural world to describe this process of Buddhist practice he talks

133
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:59,160
about it being a process of growth approx a process of development and he

134
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,860
the word is used sometimes is translated as cultivating

135
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,459
and developing and I think of it like cultivating a plant you don't engineer the plant you don't

136
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:17,279
tug on it so it grows faster you nourish it nurture it protect it so

137
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,740
the natural process of the plant can grow and so the natural process that leads to

138
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:28,740
Awakening is the languages it's called it brings it goes to fruition

139
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:35,399
the someone is enlightened has attained the fruit but in order to have a fruit grow the

140
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,500
tree has to be protected and supported and allowed to grow

141
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,899
so there was that egg analogy which I don't know how you feel about that but

142
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:52,440
one of the most common reference points the Buddha uses for the kind of care

143
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:59,579
kind of attention the kind of inner life that we need to have to bring about

144
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:06,779
Awakening full Awakening he uses them as a metaphor a word in

145
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:12,959
Pali Sanskrit which is Yoni and exactly what Yoni means is not you know it's a

146
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,480
little bit variable it depends on how it's but uh in the most literal meaning for

147
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,240
humans it means the womb it could also mean the the fundamental

148
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:31,980
source for something the poly English dictionary gives Matrix as one of the meanings of it and Matrix

149
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:37,920
it comes from the Latin word mother and uh Matrix is a place where this

150
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:45,120
Matrix of things that allows things to develop and to grow so by the study of a womb I think is one

151
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,180
of the most primary representations of what is a natural process that we're

152
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,220
part of as human beings what could be more natural than producing children and

153
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:02,220
growing children and developing having them develop Within certainly a person might want to have

154
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,440
children and desire children and tend to have them but at some point you have to

155
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,079
you know once you're pregnant you let this natural process unfold and you have

156
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:19,620
to kind of support it to nourish and protect it that natural process the best you can I mean eventually I guess we'll

157
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:26,459
start doing genetic engineering but I don't know if we're quite there yet for the embryo are we starting to do

158
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:31,620
it anyway traditionally you know it's a completely natural process that is not

159
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,660
part of the you know human artifice and and Engineering that we do

160
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:43,259
and so it's representative of this natural process and um and so the word the phrase that's

161
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:50,639
very important in the Buddha's teachings is yoniso manisikara and I translate it the manisikara means

162
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,699
the doing the activities of the of the intellect of the mental activities so

163
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:04,020
that somehow our inner mental life our inner spiritual life is something that yoniso means it comes

164
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:12,120
from the womb comes from a deep Source Within the sankara's these uh mental formations

165
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:18,780
and constructs that the Buddha wants to shatter and be an end with are products

166
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,880
of clinging in the mind and the mind becomes free of the

167
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,820
clinging when the constructs are shattered that doesn't mean that we stop thinking

168
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:36,179
and working and having Concepts we live by but we're no longer living by the artifice that constructs the

169
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:42,360
artificiality that the mind can create and instead the source for where our

170
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:49,160
life comes from is not the clinging of the mind but rather the the the the the

171
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:55,559
supportive flow of inequalities that come from this deep

172
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:00,900
Source within so this is why I wanted to say this this the analogy of the two

173
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:06,299
wolves doesn't quite work for Buddhism because wolves are two equal things as

174
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:14,460
opposed to um you know the attachments of the Mind versus the the natural growth that can

175
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,340
come from a womb-like source Within and so uh I sometimes I've tried calling

176
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,440
this the gestational forces within us this is the gestational energies or

177
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,500
impulses because the idea that we're gestating something we're incubating something in practice

178
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:38,520
and we're allowing something to unfold and to grow and to move through us as opposed to being the engineer for our

179
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:44,640
practice not a few people have entered practice with full of conceit I'm going

180
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:51,120
to be the first one on my block to be enlightened you know I'm just going to go through this I'm going to go to this Retreat I'm going to huff and puff I'm

181
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,340
capable I'm smart I'm energetic I've been successful in whatever I do in my

182
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:03,360
life you have a PhD from Stanford and I can certainly do this and boom you know there they go you know

183
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,760
and and uh generally it's understood if you have that kind of attitude it'll take you about 10 times longer to get

184
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:15,600
enlightened partly because you're not allowing for this natural incubation to happen

185
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,980
making room and space for this natural growth that needs to occur and what we do as practitioners and we

186
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:29,280
can do a lot it can take a lot of effort to practice but we understand what we're doing is develop is providing the

187
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,340
conditions the nurturing supportive conditions for this natural process to

188
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:42,539
unfold we're nurturing nature and um so

189
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:48,480
um so how do we do this and there's many ways of doing it but I

190
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,120
want to offer you the middle way Buddhism is famous for them calling the middle way

191
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,299
and uh and one technique the first time being I'll call it that it doesn't have

192
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:07,100
to be considered that is the practice of doing nothing

193
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:13,940
and but doing nothing while either literally or metaphorically

194
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:19,500
sitting in meditation in an upright still posture

195
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:26,400
it can be other postures it can be done lying down this way but it's a clear posture of negative Dignity of nobility

196
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,840
of uprightness of balance and we sit there in a good posture and in Zen practice

197
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,120
they put us a lot of care into sitting in this really good upright posture that

198
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,539
actually takes a lot of sometimes physical effort to kind of keep the posture going and stay stay alert

199
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:52,860
but you stay there and you and then the practice is to have this Middle Way posture

200
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,820
and don't move and on the surface of it initially

201
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:04,799
all the impatience all the reactivity that's expressed through the body moving

202
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,200
is not expressed and so you have an itch you're not

203
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:17,039
supposed to scratch yourself I mean you're allowed if you want to it's not like no one's preventing you in our tradition in Zen you're kind of

204
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:23,160
prevented [Laughter] and um but uh you know you know but we

205
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:30,840
don't you don't you don't give in to the the reactive impulses uh you feel impatient and you want to

206
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:36,900
look at your phone like you know I must have gotten it in five minutes I must have gotten a new text message

207
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:43,020
and so you know what can be wrong with checking my text right but what's wrong about it is what what

208
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:49,500
we're doing now injecting the text more likely is reinforcing the reactivity of

209
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:56,640
the Mind and the the constructs of the mind this this sankara's uh are belong to the

210
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,840
world of reactivity the world of reactivity belongs to this world of attachments and clinging that

211
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,740
belong to this place in the mind this place that is artificial or superficial doesn't really come from the depths so

212
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:17,820
we sit there and we don't give in to the impulse to check the phone we don't give in to sometimes in

213
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:23,039
meditation even if our body feels uncomfortable we don't give in to

214
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:30,260
changing and reacting and moving but learn to stay still in the discomfort when we sit

215
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:35,520
so a number of things happen then this way physically if we don't move and sit

216
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,880
still some of the layers of tension We Carry in our body which are born which

217
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,100
arise from the reactivity of in the mind this world of sankara's world of

218
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:52,140
constructs is what contributes to physical tension in our body

219
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:59,640
so as we're sitting and not moving some of it for some of us some of the daily tension that's built up begins to

220
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:06,120
relax and you know it's important the first for some people is the shoulder I mean it's still to this day sometimes when I

221
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,220
sit down to meditate my shoulders give it give a give me oh yeah you know give

222
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:17,220
give away a little bit and settle to this day still when I sit down my stomach will relax a little bit just

223
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:22,980
sitting there just the ordinary tension of daily life kind of have a chance to settle

224
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,020
as I keep sitting in meditation my breathing begins to change because I'm

225
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:34,919
busy running around doing things before I come to sit and it affects my breathing and and so then my breathing

226
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:40,400
begins to relax and this relaxing is beginning to uh

227
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:48,240
settle the reactive constructing kind of uh force in the mind this artifice this

228
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,480
construct this humanly created things that go on all the tension that you care in your

229
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,299
body don't blame the world for it don't blame others for it don't blame

230
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:05,820
your don't blame your boss all the tension you have is a product of

231
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:11,039
your own mind somehow the processing of your own mind the processes of the world

232
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:17,700
the conditions for your attention might definitely be out there and sometimes it's appropriate to address those

233
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,799
conditions out there but uh but in Buddhism the primary kind

234
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:30,960
of understanding of how tension occur builds up inside of us is goes through this constructive reactive qualities of

235
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,799
the mind that are based on clinging of something something or other and so we sit in this middle way and sit

236
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:44,880
still and and we start seeing our reactivity we don't give in to it and

237
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,220
within some with some some degree maybe there's some relaxing that goes unsettling

238
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:57,419
as we do this we also start seeing sooner or later that we have a reactive mind

239
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:04,320
and so we're sitting there sitting there sitting quietly minding your own business and we're

240
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:12,059
starting feeling impatient the meditation is not over and so the logical thing to do is to be

241
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:17,580
angry at the bell ringer you know you know it's not we can't it

242
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:23,039
can't be this long and um and so I'll look at my watch

243
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:28,860
no I'm supposed not supposed to look at my watch don't give in to the reactivity I'll keep I'll just look and see I'll

244
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:34,320
stare at the bell ringer no no I'm not supposed to do that I'm supposed to stay still that's the middle

245
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:41,940
way just still with the eyes closed stay still and um and so then we see that the mind

246
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:49,400
what the mind is doing more oh I'm starting to write letters to the president of IMC

247
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:55,080
that is that the sittings are too long and if this Buddhism is really up to

248
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,740
snuff like you know the com app 10 minutes should be enough

249
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:06,000
and this 45 you know 35 minutes for Sunday morning is just I have to you

250
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,020
know this is like old-fashioned you know if we have our meditation Technologies really up to Snuff you know

251
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:18,659
10 minutes should be plenty and you guys get you know old-fashioned and not really up to date with

252
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:24,840
so you start seeing the Mind writing letters in reacting it's like reacting and and then you're reciting the letters

253
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:30,799
you know you know with the exclamation point thanks or good luck or something

254
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:35,880
and you start seeing that the Ang the mind is angry the mind is upset the mind

255
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:42,960
it gets goes carried away and these trains of thoughts and it does that's not the middle way

256
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,539
the middle way is to stay still in the mind there's and then next time it happens

257
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:53,580
you start writing these letters he said no I don't know how to do that let's not get involved in that let that act let's

258
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:59,220
not get into that activation of the Mind and lo and behold over time you start

259
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,440
seeing more and more how the mind gets caught in thoughts and reactivity and emotions

260
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,539
and you learn the difference between being involved in those and staying on

261
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:17,100
the middle path staying in that middle way so it's not just the body that stays still it's also the Mind begins to stay

262
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:25,860
still but it's not a frozen Stillness it's the Stillness of a hen sitting on

263
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:32,159
our eggs it's the nurturing Stillness that allows

264
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:40,020
for something that needs supportive conditions to come forth to grow

265
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:46,980
something inside of us wants to be born the Dharma that's in you wants to be

266
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:54,240
born the path to Liberation wants to be born the what wants to be born is these

267
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:01,620
beautiful qualities that arise out of non-clinging and the primary this there's lots of

268
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:07,440
things like this but in the in Buddhism there's seven qualities that it most

269
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:14,400
emphasizes that are supported by this yoniso money sikara this um

270
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,880
inner life that arises out of this deep profound Source within us

271
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,220
and these are the seven factors of Awakening and what's interesting about these is

272
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:31,559
that in this form as the unit is coming out of the out of the womb what's going

273
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:38,159
to be born they are not practices we do but qualities that flower inside of us

274
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,740
that come to fruition so they are so first is mindfulness and

275
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:49,679
in popular Society these days mindfulness is a technique in Buddhism mindfulness is not a

276
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:57,299
technique but it's more like a state that we become endowed with that grows and develops

277
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:03,240
there is the capacity to see clearly usually called investigation

278
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:09,179
there's no investigating going on it's a natural capacity to start seeing what's

279
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:14,700
happening clearly when the mind the reactive mind has gotten still

280
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:20,039
there is uh engagement a natural kind of you can see it's

281
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:25,200
beautiful to feel that in the Stillness of this middle way of sitting upright

282
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:32,399
and being present there's a certain Vitality animation in being really

283
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:37,799
embodied in here this is not a passive thing but the

284
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:43,140
embodiment the animation is from an inner source that keeps us kind of

285
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:48,299
engaged that doesn't it's not the mind applying effort

286
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:54,240
but rather we're receiving than this animated animation from inside that's

287
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,240
flowing and it's not automatic but it's beautiful to feel in meditation the flow

288
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:07,140
of being alive the flow of being being energized the flow that's being energized that's

289
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:14,580
intelligent and the intelligence of this effort that the the Buddhism emphasizes is the

290
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:21,299
intelligence that flows into what is wholesome that's a healthy that's nourishing and

291
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:26,580
stays away from what's unhealthy unwholesome reactive

292
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:33,659
and then the fourth of these seven factors of Awakening is joy Joy is not a technique Joy is a

293
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:41,220
byproduct of this what wants to be born coming out of this it's part of the gestational forces that we have inside

294
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:47,159
Tranquility a deep abiding feeling of oceanic tranquility

295
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:53,760
that can come and then the the sixth one which is where there's a lot of reactivity a lot

296
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,880
of constructing and trying to make happen around this is samadhi and concentration

297
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:07,980
but here again at samadhi is not something we construct and make happen but we create the nurturing conditions

298
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:15,240
that allows for this deep stability deep unification of mind to come together

299
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,299
it's not something we have to do but something we allow for and that's in the seventh of these

300
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:29,460
factors is a deep profound sense of equanimity that is a sweet and feels sweet and

301
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:35,880
freeing and feels like a phenomenal gift Equanimity being a mind which is

302
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:43,380
non-reactive the reactivity of the mind has stopped but our lit life force is fully alive

303
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:50,460
and flowing so that's why it feels so good to have this flowing flowingness and aliveness

304
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,919
and presence without the the the static

305
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:02,220
of reactivity in the mind so in Buddhism then the teachings of the

306
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:07,740
Buddha there are these two different systems processes within us

307
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:14,720
one which is um synthetic

308
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:22,260
Greek word for constructed put together and the other which is natural

309
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:28,320
which is just if you allow me to try this out gestational

310
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:34,919
and the what we're trying to do in Buddhist practice is support the gestational

311
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,500
processes the natural processes that exist inside of us

312
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:46,740
and so we see a phenomenal celebration I call it a phenomenal

313
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:52,380
appreciation or valuing of a natural process that we all that exists in all

314
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:58,200
of us that often get submerged or cut out or rejected

315
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:05,880
in when we're too much in the mind or too much in our constructs and our beliefs in our reactivity

316
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,279
but to but to but be able to calm down the reactivity enough

317
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:19,440
to start feeling the flow the warmth the the the the the the generosity of it can

318
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,159
flow from inside from inside out that the Buddha is a little bit Likens to in a different in a certain analogy

319
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,580
to a underwater spring that flows a spring of water where water flows up

320
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:38,760
inside the spring and flows out and spreads out in a nourishing way throughout the spring throughout the

321
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:46,820
lake so in the same way there's this nourishing flow that can happen

322
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:55,260
for people who've never practiced generally is to somehow live in that middle way

323
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:02,760
follow the middle path of being still enough that we're not giving into our reactive forces

324
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,580
so they have a chance to relax that we have a chance to see them clearly

325
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:14,760
and in seeing them clearly especially the ones of the mind of not feeding them

326
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,099
not nourishing them because where they were nourishing the wrong thing

327
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:25,800
our capacity to nourish to support to feed

328
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:33,138
to um is one of the primary

329
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:44,099
wealths that we have the richness of human life is our human capacity that our attention

330
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:51,720
what we bring attention to and how we bring attention is you know is where the

331
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:57,599
where we have the opportunity to give birth to what is most healthy

332
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,599
so what is it in you that wants to be born

333
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,760
not what in you that you want to acquire

334
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,920
not in you what you want to accomplish

335
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,740
in the world but what is it that deep inside that in

336
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:24,920
the deepest place you have what wants to be born

337
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,560
how would you know that how would you have discovered that and one of the ways is to become quiet

338
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:37,500
and still enough to distilling of the reactive mind

339
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:45,359
and when there's enough stilling and attention I think you start you'll start feeling or sensing that yes in

340
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:52,320
fact something wants to be born and and then to nourish that to support

341
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,680
it to make room for it which you can't do you cannot do if

342
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:05,700
you're too busy if you're running around trying to accomplish all the things that's possible to accomplish in Silicon Valley

343
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:12,060
yeah you probably won't have room in a time

344
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:17,880
that is needed for such deeper Wellspring to come forth

345
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,460
and for in the in the Buddhist tradition part of that deeper Wellspring of what

346
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:30,359
wants to come forth is liberation is freedom from these reactivities

347
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:36,000
freedom from construct freedom from attachment it's a biological Force

348
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,220
biological imperative almost that exists within us

349
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:45,680
it won't Liberation wants to be born

350
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:54,720
so um two forces within us which will you feed

351
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,780
whichever one you feed to a win but I think the world loses

352
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:07,680
if reactivity wins maybe you'll become a billionaire

353
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:14,579
with your reactive mind but the world will lose because the world benefits from people

354
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:20,099
when the best inner qualities of who we are have a chance to flower and develop

355
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:25,619
and grow and and then we become a gift for the world Who We Are

356
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:32,760
and which is one of the greatest things to do in human life so in this way also with this kind of

357
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:39,960
way of understanding this early Buddhist teachings naturalistic quality of it

358
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:47,099
um it's uh it's kind of uh it's I wouldn't call it World affirming but

359
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:53,040
it's it's nature affirming it's affirming something very powerful and meaningful in our life

360
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,460
that sometimes we don't understand in Buddhism if we if teachers like me talk

361
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:06,420
too much about letting go just let go let go let go but now if teachers like me to talk too

362
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:14,400
much about letting go just reinterpret it as being let go so this natural process can can flower in

363
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:22,260
you so thank you and we have about five six minutes if

364
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:30,200
any of you would like to have questions or comments or clarification you're welcome to do it

365
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:48,900
ah thank you it's uh it was very enlightening yeah probably not a good word to use here but uh I mean yeah

366
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:54,000
a practical question I have you mentioned um resisting to look at the

367
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,920
phone or the watch watch actually specifically yeah resisting uh desire to look at the watch

368
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,099
or the oh yes yes yes so is it better to not bring a device whether it's watch or

369
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:14,300
phone again at all or is it better to resist the desire

370
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,119
well there is um kind of a

371
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:27,420
without any other context for the question the generic answer is

372
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:33,720
um don't bring the watch and that's you know that's kind of a standard kind of thing but uh I prefer

373
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:39,900
the contextual answer and that is what would be most interesting for you what would be useful

374
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:45,300
for you if you're so compulsive that uh that you

375
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:51,599
you can't even meditate because you're always looking at your watch maybe leave it behind for a while

376
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,240
until you've settled down enough that you can keep it on that is not an issue

377
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:03,480
or or maybe it's an issue but it's not that terrible but it's still an issue

378
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:09,660
anything you know I need to deal with my reactivity so this is an opportunity I'm going to

379
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:16,339
definitely wear my watch but I'm not going to look at it and I even if I have to break out in the sweat

380
00:40:16,339 --> 00:40:23,099
you know just like hold on to my knees you know or just cross my arms so I don't look or something I'm gonna not

381
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:30,839
look at it because I want to deal with it I want to get to the bottom of it so I prefer my second answer

382
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:37,880
because whatever is useful for you whatever helps you find your way is that okay

383
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,660
thank you um I am very curious about the middle

384
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:58,280
path and one of the ways that I come to understand something more deeply is to understand what's around it

385
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:05,160
can you describe because where there's a middle path there's usually a high and a low also or a left and a right can you

386
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:10,200
describe the other two because I think that'll help me understand how to maintain the middle

387
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:16,859
path right good that's very good question the language of the middle path the

388
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:23,640
middle way is used in so many different ways for so many different contrasts you know to sides of it what it might be

389
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:29,180
today I think I was using it with the idea the difference between

390
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:34,380
being reactive and doing absolutely nothing kind of

391
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:39,660
giving up collapsing into the situation and so because some people just give up and

392
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:48,320
just like this hopeless and just kind of like you know just spend the day in bed or something it's fascinating this idea of I think

393
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:54,660
of a middle way of kind of not doing in conventional ways not doing anything but

394
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:59,880
in unconventional way you're really staying alert and present and still

395
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,940
so it means that we're not actively going out to do something but we're also not collapsing

396
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:12,900
for is this fascinating to do very helpful to do for example if there's a lot of sadness or grief

397
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:18,960
we don't want to block or resist sadness and grief but we also don't want to collapse in it

398
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,140
and so uh and so to be able to sit upright this way and just let the tears flow

399
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:32,040
uh without going oh no poor me you know just don't go oh you might feel that way but you're going to keep you're not

400
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:39,540
going to resist it or block it or judge the sadness okay you're allowed to be sad here let it flow but let me just

401
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:45,720
kind of stay this way and the advantage of that is that is that then this deeper

402
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:52,560
natural process that can support or process our sadness has a chance

403
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,660
if we collapse to it then we're actually reinforcing the reactivity around it

404
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:04,020
that is often a big can be a big component part of some people's sadness and grief that we don't see

405
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:10,440
so that's the kind of the contrast I was setting up in the most classic uh idea in Buddhism

406
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:16,400
the middle way is that the middleweight between the

407
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,980
essential desires pursuing all kinds of sensual desires and essential denial

408
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:29,300
asceticism so somehow the middle way between that another middle way that Buddhism

409
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:35,460
Composites is the middle way between the idea that anything really exists

410
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:40,040
or the idea that nothing really exists

411
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:47,640
so that's a little bit more philosophical but that's that's also profound thank you that actually helped me a lot

412
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:54,119
getting it for just this context so what explaining as you did for just this

413
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:59,760
example today yeah great seeing the two sides that helps me a lot wonderful thanks yeah thanks for asking the

414
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,220
question so maybe one more and then

415
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,920
point is it reacting to your emotions versus

416
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,260
um self-soothing as an act of self-compassion

417
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:25,920
well you know this is where uh you know giving these kinds of talks

418
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:32,040
lends itself to a certain kind of reductionalism it's a little bit too much at times I can't really explain everything

419
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:37,680
so I like I appreciate your question a lot sometimes reactivity

420
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,020
is uh is wise sometimes reactivity we react in a way

421
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:52,079
to care for our worst regular activity so maybe uh uh you know

422
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,900
our anger is so strong and we feel so much challenged by it and we want it to

423
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:03,720
go away and and we so we want to get making go away in a reactive way but we

424
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:09,599
don't reject it we bring a soothing compassion to it

425
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:15,119
and that's compassion may be as close to being this gestational Force within us

426
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:21,060
but we're initiating it in a reactive way because we really don't want to be angry

427
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:28,800
but it's successful maybe the anger calms down enough that way so we're using a wiser reactivity

428
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,440
to address a reactivity which is worse

429
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:40,920
so we don't want to be too black and white or blue you know absolute between these two different worlds that one is

430
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:46,200
all bad and one is all good or something so sometimes reactivity can support us

431
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:51,319
from settling you know stronger reactivity

432
00:45:51,319 --> 00:45:56,819
but when when but when is but when is bringing compassion to the anger not a

433
00:45:56,819 --> 00:46:03,000
reactivity but a source of wisdom I think that's also a good question there's not that doesn't have to have

434
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,099
any reactivity to it that has just like some deeper knowing inside knows to

435
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:13,920
bring this compassion and hold it kindly and supportively uh nurturingly like a

436
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:19,319
mother would hold an angry little child um you know just love and care it's part

437
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:24,660
of the nurturing and loving um and and how to know the difference

438
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:31,920
between this um I think that over time you start being able to identifying the difference

439
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,200
and one of the differences is that reactivity always has some quality of

440
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:43,680
tension with it whereas the nurturing qualities have no tension with it

441
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:50,160
but to be able to identify that in subtle ways it takes a lot of practice and sensitivity

442
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,859
what do you think of my answer I liked your question

443
00:46:55,859 --> 00:47:01,940
um what I heard when you said that is that there's a difference between reaction and responding to something

444
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:07,619
when we choose the reaction or we allow the reaction we might be responding to

445
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:13,500
it um I've learned sometimes to just let go of that reaction and allowing myself to

446
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:20,040
Despair and making room for it it makes it last for a lot shorter period of time

447
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:25,920
and I can see it and I can almost get tired of it or laugh at myself for

448
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:32,040
it and then it disappears but the more I fight it it's uh it does not work very

449
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:39,780
nice so a very dramatic person I am so I need that but yeah great lovely

450
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:44,819
so thank you all so I it's kind of wonderful I think that people are coming
