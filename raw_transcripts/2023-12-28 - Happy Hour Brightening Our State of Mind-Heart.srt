19
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:09,119
this is a good time for reflection um especially reflection around kindness

20
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,360
um I had a conversation with a friend the other day and um a good Dharma

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,879
friend and we were reflecting on know as you go to bed every night to to perhaps

22
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,040
consider contemplate whatever your state of mind

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,239
is whatever your state of heart is if if I didn't wake up tomorrow morning if I

24
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,959
didn't wake up tomorrow morning um and the theme relates to rebirth death and

25
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,519
rebirth because in some ways 20 23 the year the old year is dying the new year

26
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:53,640
is is being given birth to um so along the same lines if

27
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:02,080
if whatever my state of mind is whether I'm um filled with meta and kindness for

28
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,440
others myself the world whether there's brightness in my heart and mind or

29
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,799
whether there's anger resentment what is this the state of

30
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,040
mind that I wanted to if if I didn't wake up tomorrow is this is this what I

31
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:28,080
want to be what I remember what I go to bed with there's a sense of is this how I want to be closing out uh this phase

32
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,439
with so and it's never too late we always look forward to the new the next

how do I want to be in this moment maybe if there's suffering in

44
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,800
this mind in this body maybe I want to have more kindness in this

pet

64
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:20,160
letting your heart be subtly subtly uplifted just a little

65
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:27,600
brighter through this act of generosity with your kindness giving them a gift of your

and now for the third part of this practice session after

69
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:05,000
having shared sh our own Goodwill with ourselves shared it with someone else

70
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:13,640
others now let's imagine ourselves completely open to

71
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:19,880
receiving a gift the same way that when we were children

72
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,360
perhaps we're open to receiving gifts from from

73
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:34,880
Santa our hearts were opened we didn't say no we don't want gifts of kindness generosity we received gifts we accepted

74
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:41,559
them the same innocence of accepting

75
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,159
generosity let yourself receive receive the generosity of

76
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:55,240
Goodwill could be either from your friend your benefactor this child or pet you're

77
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:01,160
imagining or it could be from an archetype from Buddha from

78
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:07,280
[Music] quen from a being of light from the

79
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,240
universe this gift being the gift of Goodwill just let yourself feel

80
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:20,840

81
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:30,158
kindness given to you opening your heart your whole body to bask in it

82
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:38,559

85
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,360
least if it's possible it's always

86
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
possible

87
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:56,679
and whatever state of mind you have right [Music] now what is the state of mind is this is

88
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:04,960
this the state of mind you would wish to [Music] have is if you went to bed and did not

89
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,200

00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:29,159
free everyone ah Sun an interesting practice

104
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:36,120
right when we connect awareness mindfulness of our state of mind right now what do we want this state of mind

105
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,520
to be right now especially if we raise the stakes and think oh is this the last

106
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:48,640
if if this were my last moment if I went to bed like this and didn't never woke up is this the state of mind I want to

107
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:57,480
have and then how how do I do I let go do I forgive do I bring in more kindness

108
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:04,960
what what's the wise action so so with

109
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:13,720
that i' uh like to invite us if you would like to um explore this theme how

110
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,360
it it lands for you um and exploring from your own

111
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:28,440
experience you can explore this meditation you can talk about this meditation how this meditation was for you or how this theme impacts you

112
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,600
um again you're speaking from your own experience uh sharing one nugget

113
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,679
allowing the next person to share a nugget and then the next person and and

114
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:46,240
you're asked to not comment on each other's experiences and it's okay to share what you're exploring as long as

115
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:53,039
it's within this context of the practice and and um

116
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,720
yeah and uh holding each other with kindness if it's If This Were the last

117
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,159
time you saw each other um in this way how do you want to be remembered how do

118
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:10,399
you want to be how do you want to leave what gift do you want to impart what

119
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:17,960
gift of kindness um do you want to impart on people um Maya Angelo has famously said

120
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,880
people are not going to remember people will not remember what you said but they will remember how you made them feel I'm

121
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,320
paraphrasing but it's essentially that so how how are you going to leave people

122
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:35,640
with kindness touch them with kindness and and your Goodwill in the small

123
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:42,840
groups so with that I'm going to create the uh the small groups the breakout

124
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:53,120
rooms and you are invited to um speak in Reverse alphabetical order um be kind be

125
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,159

126
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:04,039
here we go welcome back

127
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:13,720

129
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:27,000
exploration in the small groups the floor is yours oh and you can also put um your Reflections in chat if you type

130
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,399
them to me they'll be private I won't read your name and if you type them to everyone I

131
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:37,840
will read your name and you can also raise your hand just like

132
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,279
Mima thank you Nikki um what I've noticed in this practice kind of brought

133
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:50,519
more things closer for me to be able to see is I noticed the kindness acts like

134
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:56,480
gestures towards myself like um I mentioned in um in the group that um I

135
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,640
have a walking buddy and every morning she hugs me when I see her like I'm just and I'm so much more receptive to these

136
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:10,480
kind gestures and I could feel like my heart light up and it radiates throughout my body um I noticed um I had

137
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,840
double vision and my son went to get my hand to help me um and it I felt his

138
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,960
tenderness like so the I don't know I can't even it just like touch me and

139
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:28,279
he's a grown man but I did tell him I said I notice your tenderness like you're so gentle with me and I had not

140
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:34,960
noticed it before so I feel like it's made me this practice has made me much more receptive to

141
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:43,039
kindness and also much more aware when it isn't there yeah so it's um it's benefited me

142
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,559
tremendously and made me much more aware when it is

143
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:55,360
there thank you for letting me share that thank you Mima for sharing this

144
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,840
this is a sensitivity training yeah and isn't that

145
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,640
wonderful for us to become more sensitive as human beings it's just

146
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:15,559
oh yeah and and of course it makes us um as it makes us more sensitive it's also

147
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:20,840
strength because then someone might think oh then things hurt some more well

148
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:27,399
yes and then and then at the same time there is do it's a choice do we want to

149
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:33,200
be a rock going through life not feeling anything like that song I am a rock I'm

150
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:39,080
an island I don't feel anything right I don't feel no pain right we can be an

151
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:45,840
island we can be a rock not touching anyone not being touched and yet we can become more sensitive feeling when

152
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:53,000
people are touching us or touched by us and we get touched by them this sensitivity this tend and it's beautiful

153
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,240
so beautiful ah thank you thanks for sharing this Mima

154
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:09,799
yeah Maran yeah I came in late sorry about

155
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:15,000
that then I lost my internet so it if you had to continually accept me into

156
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,720
the room I apologize no no it was all good in fact I had to um I had some

157
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,440
problems with and I mentioned at the beginning but I'll share it again there were some issues at the beginning so I

158
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,360
had to restart Zoom a couple of times and people were thrown off so that that people are affected so thanks for your

159
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:41,200
patience and here you are thanks for making it Maran and it was it was uh hearing that

160
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:48,080
just for Guan yen to give meta for one minute one possible minute

161
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:56,360
was was very very powerful um I thought and big problems can I don't know be

162
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,880
helped by that for one minute and who knows what a what that Catalyst could be

163
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:09,639
a one minute of meal like that so thank you for that very much ah thank you Maran thanks so much

164
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:15,360
for sharing your experience and how powerful that um invitation actually

165
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:22,360
implementing that invitation was for you and and um it's it's amazing right

166
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:28,760
because sometimes if we think of this practice as oh it's hard I can't do this and then we think oh I can do this for

167
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:36,159
just one minute or just one I can or just 5 seconds I can do this for just one second I can let this love in I can

168
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,559
accept love for one second and it's okay I'm going to shut down in one second no problem but in just one second I'm going

169
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:49,440
to open up and let it in and and that can make a huge difference because we can yes we can um and that one second

170
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:56,039
will become two seconds and a minute and then five minutes an hour and then that's who we become more and more and

171
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:02,480
more thanks Maria thanks for highlighting that

172
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,799

group uh about this practice tonight

175
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:32,240
uh specifically but also in general this a space uh that has been created uh

176
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:40,799
through time and is allowing for this possibility of openness of meta kindness

177
