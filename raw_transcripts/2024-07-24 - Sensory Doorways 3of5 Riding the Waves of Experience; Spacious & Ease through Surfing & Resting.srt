1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,639
all of the friendly greetings and

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,000
interactions happy to be with you

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,199
and I'm wondering if anyone noticed anything

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,680
about their senses yesterday and pop that in the chat for just a moment if

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:31,960
you wish what senses help you stay most connected where you might not notice as

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,480
much great so we have a bit of a lag so I'm

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,239
going to move on and go ahead and start with the meditation here but um I will check the chat for

8
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:00,440
any responses about that in a few minutes

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:09,560
so the invitation is to notice that you're

10
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,320
sitting many of you watching the screen some with your eyes

11
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:28,359
closed and notice how it feels in your body to be present

12
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:39,439
maybe noticing the warmth of familiarity of the

13
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,640
company any heart qualities that might be

14
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:03,200
present noticing cause and effect of being present as you drop in become

15
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,080
present to the meditation and then if it feels

16
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,920
right after you've made any greetings you want to

17
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:24,480
make starting with a couple of longer slower deeper breaths

18
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:40,840
really letting go on the out breath releasing any extra

19
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,280
tension and letting go into the moment into

20
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,840
this softening your eyes and when you're ready closing [Music]

21
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,519
them and perhaps imagining gazing out over a beautiful

22
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:12,680
Vista vast Ocean or Canyon or

23
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,919
landscape and then letting go of that [Music]

24
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:30,799
imagination allowing the continuation of the softness of gaze

25
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:41,879
allowing the breathing to return to

26
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,040
normal noticing your jaw perhaps your tongue

27
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:59,200
the tip of your tongue at a pallet with your mouth

28
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,760
and shifting stepping into your

29
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:25,560
senses all of the sounds around you and the silences between them

30
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,479
all of the sensations of each

31
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,880
breath perhaps the Gap a little pause at the end of the out

32
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:54,720
breath before the in breath begins to fill your torso

33
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:14,680
tuning in to whatever sense area

34
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,360
experience keeps you most consistently

35
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,240
present I'll offer instructions on breathing

36
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,800
however if the flux and flow of sound or overall

37
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,520
body sensation or the flow of

38
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,960
now is more hospitable please allow that to be your object of

39
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,960
attention

40
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,800
of dedicating the

41
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,000
attention to the beginning of the in

42
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:22,680
breath the gradual filling of the lungs shifting of the

43
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,039
diaphragm perhaps Sensations at the nose or throat

44
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:38,199
noticing the moment of fullness at the top of the in

45
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,840
breath and then the moment of

46
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:57,400
release the ease of the out breath

47
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,520
staying in contact with the

48
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,919
entirety of the in breath the

49
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,199
pause the release of the out

50
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:30,160
breath and perhaps noticing resting in that tiny Gap at the end

51
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,720
of the out

52
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,680
breath that moment of

53
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:57,120
Stillness riding the waves of breathing

54
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:31,440
if another sense experience sound

55
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,599
stray sensation [Music]

56
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:48,720
smell moment of flavor or experience of Mind pulls the

57
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:56,120
attention noticing that too bir into

58
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,560
being last and change for a while while and then

59
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,120
fade and then when it's no longer

60
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,240
predominant returning your attention or allowing the attention to

61
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,360
be naturally drawn into

62
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:41,640
the flux and flow of the next arising breath sound

63
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,360
object

64
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,920
usefully staying with the flow

65
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:11,000
we'll practice mostly in silence for a while I might add a few little invitations here and

66
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
there

67

shift or become more acute noticing

73
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:28,399
that savoring any bits of comfort or ease or pleasure

74
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:37,079
and being with with kindness

together the invitation is to turn your attention [Music]

110
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,360
to your core your physical core and your

111
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:42,960
emotional Center perhaps of the heart or throughout the

112
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:52,720
Torso to notice with kind appreciation whatever's

113
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,240
there just not it

114
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:08,480
and [Music] then cast your mind

115
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,000
back over these moments of

116
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:23,760
meditation with an appreciative receptive

117
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:33,600
sensibility savoring steep in any moments of pleasure

goodness

119
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:48,080
presence any moments of flowing with riding the

120
00:29:52,919 --> 00:30:00,039
senses and appreciating above all your own dedication to showing up

121
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,919
for however long in whatever

122
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:13,320
way and from that kind appreciative

123
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:22,919
Place lovingly including any challenges or difficulties that

124
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,960
arose without a need to judge

125
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,840
criticize

126

life may our practice here together Ripple through our own hearts

133
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:33,440
and minds and lives to all of the lives we

134
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,278

[Music]

138
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:19,158
thank you for your

139
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
practice

140
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,799
for e

141
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:40,720
so warm greetings again everyone everyone who's been here the whole meditation and those of you who tiptoed

142
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:48,440
into the zoom YouTube chat room and sit just a little bit

143
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:54,679
late so today is the third of five talks

144
00:33:54,679 --> 00:34:01,320
on the sense doors sight sound smell

145
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:07,520
taste touch or bodily sensation and the heart and

146
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:14,240
mind and today I'd like to talk about ways that spaciousness ease can be

147
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:20,560
available at the scent stores and offer a couple of tips that about meditation

148
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,720
that fit into the general category of hanging out at the scense stores

149
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:33,520
stepping into to sensory practice and spending some time there not a lot of

150
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:42,079
effort required so these two practices are surfing the senses and resting in the

151
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,760
spaces between or simply resting and I'll start with a little

152
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,240
anecdote so some weeks back I was meditating at the ocean open

153
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,320
eyes it's actually a pretty remote location not a lot of people

154
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,440
but there was a surfer very um dedicated Surfer camped out on the beach a little

155
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:10,079
ways away and occasionally he would glide through my

156
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:18,960
visual field on this wave just completely one with the ocean in perfect

157
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,359
balance and not unlike that Surfer though with a lot less effort perhaps

158
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:31,240
and practice we can ride and be supported by in harmony with the

159
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:38,119
waves and flux and flow of sensory experience flowing

160
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:45,960
through our sense doors it's this flux and

161
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:53,680
flow we can serve our senses so

162
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,119
noticing with your eyes and do it now if conditions allow

163
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:08,240
changes in light Shadow motion changes in Focus or

164
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:17,520
softness just noticing perhaps noticing the movement

165
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,520
of wind in the grasses or flow of the trees or

166
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,280
birds flying all all of that can be a way of

167
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:36,319
tapping into staying present with the flow of

168
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:42,400
change I um practiced taichi for many years quite seriously I still do it on

169
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,920
Retreat and one of the instructions we got was to allow the hand to move on the

170
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,119
in during our different postures we were moving through the visual field without

171
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:59,520
looking at the hand but rather allowing the hand to move through just like a

172
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:08,560
bird or a cloud moves through the sky and then there's the flavor or

173
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:16,079
texture of the moment literally like when tasting food or drink you might

174
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,920
notice a good tea or a good coffee changes in flavor from beginning to end

175
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:29,000
of sip sip sorry and there's the taste on the front

176
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,040
of the tongue the middle of the tongue the back of the tongue the different and

177
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:41,079
sort of variation over the lifetime of a single

178
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,520
swallow this kind of Surfing the senses involves noticing the very slow and very

179
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:56,440
fast and we've all done this sunrises and sunsets are very slow

180
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:02,079
change thunderstorms can be quite fast the

181
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,400
flickering of an oil lamp or a candle fire can be mesmerizing and

182
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:15,160
languid or very fast even the mind and heart as aan

183
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:21,359
suito says can change faster than the flick of a horse's

184
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,200
tail I'm actually very touched by stories of Richard Fineman may he rest

185
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:35,160
in peace he loved to discover that he was wrong and to change his

186
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:42,720
mind and changing our minds can be delightful if we're open to

187
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,640
it it's noticing the flavor of the moment as it were in a more figurative

188
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:57,000
way changes in attention same thing and then there's the general flux

189
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:04,079
and FL flow the sound of wind chimes the flocking of birds there's so much

190
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:10,800
Beauty and in unfolding in constancy whirling around and within us everywhere

191
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,920
all the time the rapid turning of a bicycle wheel or the flow of swiftly

192
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:26,800
moving water scintillating waves on the ocean or a lake or that child's game which I

193
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:34,640
recommend to adults of watching clouds form deform and reform into different

194
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:41,520
shapes it's all Cloud but cloud is a process not an object a constantly

195
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,560
changing process different warar shock like

196
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:54,640
shapes all of this can be beautiful and it's otherwise

197
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:01,240
known as anich that's the poly for the perception of

198
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,920
inconstancy the invitation and surfing your senses is to let yourself feel

199
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:15,920
interest wonder even a pulse of Joy surprise

200
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:23,040
Delight let go into the flow the possibility of delight lives in the

201
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,640
details of each moment of change freshness novel

202
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,720
is the gift of inhabiting here and now and the only purchase price for this

203
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:42,960
Joy this ease is to pay attention to be there closely completely

204
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:49,079
with intent dedication isn't that

205
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:56,440
nice so I got to tell you many of the classical Traden teachings the old older

206
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:02,400
um teachings that formed in the wake of the Buddha's life emphasize the

207
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,560
suffering in this kind of inconstancy and there's wisdom in those

208
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:12,880
teachings in that they encourage us to let go very famous

209
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:19,240
teaching from aan cha a great teacher in the Thai Forest tradition likened

210
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:24,920
suffering to rope burn to when we hang on when change is moving

211
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:31,319
through so noticing the suffering of change can result in letting go however

212
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:36,680
this surfing this senses teaches our minds and hearts to let go in a

213
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:43,880
different way by finding the ease the spaciousness and being in the flow of

214
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:49,200
momentto moment experience without clinging just enjoying the

215
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:55,079
ride just enjoying the ride suffering is only present in this

216
00:41:55,079 --> 00:42:03,160
practice if you try to make something happen resist something happening or hang

217
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:11,000
on this way of rioting the senses means appreciating changes and differences for

218
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,760
their own sake in real time and that too conditions the mind and heart not to

219
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,880
cling through positive reinforcement it's like that very famous teaching in

220
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:30,119
Insight Meditation that we should be kind when attention returns like being kind to a puppy when it finally comes

221
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:36,319
when you call it that begins to teach a different

222
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:43,319
orientation to how to show up for the joy of seeing feeling and letting

223
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:50,319
go this can to have practical benefits too so many of you know that I came into

224
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:58,720
the Dharma through What's called the dooka doorway the and dooka dooka pain and at a certain point in my life

225
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,000
far too early in my life I encountered a medical condition that seemed to just

226
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,440
cause an intractable block of pain to be there all the time and as I started

227
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:15,319
meditating with very many expectations I have to say I discovered that this kind

228
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:21,040
of Flux Of change was really good news because rather than a solid conceptual

229
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,599
block of pain that seemed to be there all the time and last forever Sensations

230
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:35,160
changed shifted broke down altered and then I started to notice

231
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:44,040
lifegiving gaps in the pain breaks where Ease spaciousness comfort Joy

232
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:50,079
existed and that was the beginning of a profound journey of

233
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,319
healing so I'll probably talk about it more in the coming days of this week but

234
00:43:55,319 --> 00:44:03,720
I want to just briefly say that that transitions us to the second practice which is noticing the spaces

235
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:10,800
and the gaps in sensory experience the Brits have the saying in

236
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,319
the underground mind the gap mind the gap

237
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:21,520
indeed notice the spaces between the spaces between

238
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:28,480
Sensations objects trees or Hills your body occupying and moving through

239
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:37,280
space every single one of our senses can be a doorway to ease and

240
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:45,119
radical Simplicity and Present Moment awareness it's another way to relax hang

241
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:53,240
out at the sense doors and step back from any internal thought and emotional

242
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:59,040
flurries resting into the natural spacious

243
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,440
available today I'll only mention the eyes because we talked about the useless

244
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:12,119
gazing in the corners this is a similar practice now artists notice negative

245
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:19,000
space the space in between the space around objects above you around buildings or

246
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:27,119
trees or mountains or forests or oceans or fields that can also be an entry point

247
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:34,599
into noticing a spacious OAS allowing a sense of that space in

248
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:41,480
between to infuse inform our experience of this

249
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:47,680
moment so I'll say more about this in the coming days but

250
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:54,800
meanwhile as you go about your day the invitation optional homework is

251
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:01,839
to notice if there are moments where you can surf the senses or notice mindly

252
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:07,880
gaps rest in the spaces would love to hear more see more

253
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:16,240
in the chat when we see each other tomorrow thank you very much for your

254
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:23,640
practice may all beings benefit be well
