1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,759
uh good morning everyone i'm a bit early but partly i was thinking that uh

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:22,000
say a lot of you who those of you who might have been here waiting for a 6 45 beginning

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,599
and so warm greetings and and i received

4
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:37,360
about equal uh note messages about this 6 45 beginning that we had last

5
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,960
week with 45 minute meditation and the 30 minute and

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,280
so i thought it was wonderful to have the longer time and i know it's challenging for some of you

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,520
and i'll think about some other way to maybe have earlier

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,879
um longer maybe sittings and uh maybe in a month or so and

9
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,799
my family responsibilities lightened up some maybe we could do um some of these

10
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,640
mornings have a second sitting at maybe at eight o'clock and

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,680
that way maybe that could be 45 minutes and and that way some of you can

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:29,200
have been coming and getting used to this 30-minute sitting can stretch a little bit and and

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,799
discover the benefits of longer sitting and then perhaps uh we're getting close

14
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,759
to the second year mark for these 7 a.m sittings and

15
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:51,920
second year i mean the beginning of the second year one year anniversary and so it's on my mind about how

16
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,240
to support many of you to kind of take this dharma you know a step or two further building

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,640
on what this has been we've been doing for this time so we'll have a community meeting at some point

18
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,680
and maybe have a chance to talk about this and such things and and um so anyways i wanted to say hello

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,200
and and we'll start up again in a couple of

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,840
minutes that's when more people arrive

21
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,840
do

22
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
so

23
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
so

24
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
so

25
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
um

26
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,759
so it's 7 a.m here in california and so locally i can offer you a good

27
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,840
morning and happy to be together and good day and greetings for everyone around the

28
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,199
globe for participating and

29
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,680
the um the kind of the theme for this guided

30
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:53,440
meditation is balance and uh finding a balance when we sit and

31
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,639
the balance i liken it a little bit to us finding the midpoint

32
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:09,120
of a row boat maybe a fairly stable wide row boat but still a rowboat that

33
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,560
and finding the midpoint where uh there's the least amount of the center

34
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,080
of gravity kind of of the boats and to stand there with our legs firmly on the

35
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:28,160
floor of the boat and and keep our balance and maybe you know our upper part of our

36
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,800
torso is maybe not moving so much but our legs are in fact kind of going with the rocking of the boat maybe

37
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,560
it's a gentle rocking but still we're constantly making small adjustments

38
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,280
and uh and the stronger we are and our legs and torso and things like that

39
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,080
maybe the easier it is to keep our balance so in meditation we're also developing a

40
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,479
kind of inner strength and a skill at staying balanced both to recognize

41
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,919
about when we get off balance and to recognize and to have the strength to kind of stay

42
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,199
to come back to balance stay in balance and the way it works in meditation

43
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:18,400
is the most simple way is to stay balanced without

44
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,440
any kind of movement towards our experience or any movement away any wanting

45
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,880
or not wanting any movement in which we get pulled by experience are

46
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,840
pulled into our thoughts any movement pushed by the thoughts or pushed by experience of what's happening

47
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,000
and rather both physically but also you know in the heart the mind we stay

48
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,840
balanced we stay in that center place where there's a strength

49
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,800
and a stability that wisdom can operate and clear seeing can operate that we

50
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,080
lose when we start getting involved in things or we start rejecting things

51
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,800
and staying in that midpoint of the vote of our life and of course we'll go

52
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,000
a little bit off and so part of the equanimity in practice is to appreciate that of course

53
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,759
just like in a row boat we'll get them pulled this way in that way and get picked up get involved and

54
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,880
all these things but hopefully not so much and hopefully with very gentle

55
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,840
maybe even loving course corrections no stay here come back um see clearly what's

56
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,280
happening so we can stay balanced come back to that peaceful place the

57
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:47,360
still place the balance place inside the dynamic balance the dynamic peacefulness

58
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,720
i don't think that you have to rest on your meditation laurels and just stay peaceful without a kind of being

59
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,240
engaged alert mindful to stay here here

60
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:08,240
so with that as an introduction to assume a posture that maybe

61
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:16,319
manifests a degree of balance and uh and one way to

62
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,000
begin then with balance is to rock back and forth if you're sitting

63
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,199
upright and maybe sway back and forth and and then make smaller and smaller kind

64
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,440
of sways kind of looking for a place of balance with the torso balance on the sitting

65
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,560
bones balance of your weight against whatever support

66
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:47,760
is being received and then to kind of feel up the spine of the torso

67
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,760
and to make small adjustments to feel a sense of being everything's balanced

68
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,320
partly that means that the with the weight of our torso kind of at all stacked up in a way that

69
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:07,040
feels aligned with this some center line uh within so that we're not leaning

70
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,800
forward part of our weight is in front of that center of gravity and and some of it's not

71
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,040
behind and um something looking for that balance

72
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,160
and to do something where the hands and arms feel balanced as well

73
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,519
so that they're not pulled too far forward or pulled too far down so the shoulders

74
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,360
being pulled if you're sitting you might be able to pull your hands back from the knee a

75
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,720
little bit or sometimes putting a cushion or something on top of your

76
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:48,160
your your your your thighs or your ankles so the hands are held up more

77
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,279
can feel more balanced and support a balance of the torso

78
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,880
and then to close the eyes and with the eyes closed and sitting

79
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:08,560
still again feeling the body from the inside

80
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:19,360
and feeling where there is balance where there is stability in the body

81
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:26,240
where there's a kind of maybe even groundedness of your

82
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:33,839
body against whatever supports you upright whatever supports your weight

83
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:42,320
to feel that stability or groundedness rootedness

84
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:52,160
and to feel whatever seems stable within physical stability

85
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,279
some people might feel it the lower torso

86
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:06,320
around the hips pelvis some people might feel it

87
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:15,040
lower back or in the belly or maybe

88
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,760
in the area the solar plexus behind it above the diaphragm

89
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,440
and maybe there's a can be a feeling of some stability

90
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,800
as you relax your shoulders soften

91
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,839
it may be a stability

92
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,440
in the shoulder supporting the neck maybe in the back of the neck

93
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:59,040
in the way that that area supports the weight of the head

94
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:15,199
and there's a way in which tension and holding even if it's

95
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,519
stable tension is a kind of

96
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:30,560
agitation and greater stability and balance is

97
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,160
found by relaxing some of the extra tension in

98
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,720
the body softening the muscles of the face

99
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:51,200
these are muscles that are sometimes constantly engaged in daily life

100
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,880
to express ourselves communicate ourselves to the world

101
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:07,839
smiles and frowns and scowls and

102
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,959
fears held in the muscles of the face

103
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:21,680
and it's a compassionate thing for the face on the exhale to let

104
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:29,120
the muscles ease up not have to work so much

105
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,839
around the eyes forehead

106
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,680
draw

107
00:13:43,440 --> 00:14:03,839
and the same thing with agitation and restlessness in the chest if there is something

108
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:20,320
and relaxing in the chest softening easing up

109
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:31,440
without the kind of instability that comes from resistance

110
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,480
holding ourselves at our life at bay

111
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:45,839
and then softening in this belly a kind of release of the weight of the

112
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,279
belly letting it maybe that weight

113
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,839
release downward to create some inner stability in the

114
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,720
lower torso

115
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:19,199
and then to feel whatever restlessness agitation energetics there are

116
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,480
there is in the mind

117
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,800
maybe in the area where we that we have the brain or anywhere

118
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:41,680
for you it's associated with your mental emotional activity

119
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:50,879
as you exhale relaxing the mind

120
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:59,279
relaxing the mental activity slowing things down in the mind

121
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,920
softening the mind and feeling the softness

122
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:22,880
of the mind

123
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:29,120
and then gently noticing

124
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:37,120
as we sit here for a minute or so any movements towards

125
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,199
or away any being pulled into something like our

126
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,320
thoughts or any kind of movement of recoiling or

127
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,519
pulling back or being pushed back

128
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:05,839
any wanting any not wanting

129
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,678
and just simply notice that and perhaps allowing it to be there if

130
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,120
it's there feeling it sensing what it's like for

131
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,880
the body the mind to have this movement for and

132
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,438
against

133
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,000
and feel how maybe there's not much balance there

134
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:47,679
or that there's some imbalance

135
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:54,960
and then the next couple of exhales see if you can release

136
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,919
any four against wanting and not wanting release it

137
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,840
enough to feel that you're in your life mind heart

138
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,960
it comes to us balanced stability

139
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,840
or comes into a little bit more of a balanced ability than

140
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:29,840
it was when it wasn't stable

141
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,400
and then to really now

142
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,240
experience the breathing body the body

143
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:33,600
breathing almost like the awareness gently lands

144
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,840
onto the body breathing

145
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:48,720
and this is where we feel the gentle row boat where the gentle waves are breathing in

146
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:56,000
and out the movements of the body expanding and

147
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,640
contracting

148
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,840
the air moving in and out through the nostrils

149
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:17,440
and if it's easy enough to establish a kind of gentle soft

150
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:24,480
stability steadiness with the breathing

151
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,960
and as you feel any other pull and push

152
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,440
moving forward against experience wanting and not wanting

153
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,559
keep finding your stability keep coming back to the breathing

154
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,320
let the breathing support you

155
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,840
let the breathing be the place that you stand or feel

156
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,280
so you're not so easily pulled into for and against

157
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,720
staying balanced in the body body breathing

158
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:23,760
with the mind having landed and on the breathing the

159
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:33,440
body breathing not easily pulled into

160
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,120
wanting and not wanting

161
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:47,120
and if there are little movements of wanting and not moving it's okay those can be some kind of

162
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:59,840
that's the place we use to find back to balance here breathing

163
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:13,840
centered on the breathing body

164
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,960
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

165
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:04,399
i have a question for you and that is how might your

166
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:10,640
kindness your love your compassion

167
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:22,320
benefit from having an inner stability an inner balance

168
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,039
how can kindness and love and compassion benefit

169
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,080
from not being pulled into

170
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,039
in some way reacting for or against

171
00:31:49,120 --> 00:32:01,840
without being pulled into desires or pulled into aversion

172
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:10,240
to be able to open our hearts care and good will towards others

173
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:17,039
while remaining balanced without wants and not wants without

174
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:23,039
anxiety creating imbalance

175
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,519
perhaps even feeling a stability

176
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:37,278
in the kindness the good will the love the compassion

177
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:46,000
and maybe you can imagine that with whatever balance stability

178
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,200
calm you have now

179
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:58,480
sitting here can you bring to mind someone for whom

180
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,440
you have friendliness good will

181
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:11,120
compassion love and imagine sitting together

182
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:18,080
walking together and for you to remain balanced and

183
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:25,840
stable in your goodwill in your friendliness

184
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,960
not pulled into some of the com complexities that can exist in these relationships of

185
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:43,679
wanting and not wanting protecting or fear

186
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:53,840
holding back or giving too much

187
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,880
our friendliness our goodwill is one of the great resources we have

188
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,000
it can be one of the foundations for buddhist practice

189
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,838
and may it be that all beings

190
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:29,838
find a way to be balanced stable

191
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:38,800
in their happiness and safety peacefulness

192
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:48,000
may all beings find stability steadiness strength

193
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,760
their good will their heartfelt care for others

194
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,040
and may we in our balance stability for good will and friendliness

195
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,119
contribute to make it easier for others to be that way

196
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:21,520
may it be that the benefits of this meditation is something that we

197
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:30,800
bring into the world of our daily life

198
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:37,200
that we're ready to share and stay close to those benefits

199
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:45,520
may all beings be happy may all beings everywhere

200
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:59,839
be free

201
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,839
um

202
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:58,720
so the topic uh for this talk is

203
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:05,200
the equanimity factor of awakening and uh it's the seventh of the seven

204
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:11,200
factors of awakening and over the last week i've been talked to her about the earlier factors

205
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:17,520
and and we're talking about these seven factors of awakening in the context

206
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,640
of the practice of anapanasati mindfulness of breathing

207
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:29,280
where we're mindful of the mind that we experience starts experiencing the mind as we breathe in

208
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:36,640
experiencing the mind as we breathe out and so we've kind of taken our time

209
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:44,480
uh to understand some of the things we can start experiencing when we experience the mind the word

210
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:52,240
cheetah the pali word for mind c i tta is

211
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:59,839
often translated as mind state and it's not the mind as a thing

212
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:07,520
like the brain is kind of a physical thing but rather it's the way in which we experience our interior

213
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:14,400
life our mental life as a whole and rather than the particular details

214
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,760
of different activities of the mind that goes on particular thoughts feelings

215
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:26,079
impulses intentions it's the the whole of the mind that kind of and how we

216
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:32,240
experience the whole is personal and contextual and

217
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,599
depending on the different factors of the mind that come together

218
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:42,720
and and it sounds a little bit strange to say this but the state of the mind

219
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,280
how we experience a state of the mind it depends on the state of the mind or how we experience the shape of the mind

220
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,400
or how we experience this totality of the mind is based a little bit on the state of

221
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:02,480
mind or which mental factors are strongest and um but as we open to the mind and

222
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:09,280
feel it it has different characteristics that we can feel now that takes a lot of stability and

223
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,680
really settled in the practice to start feeling this whole mind and the mood or the mind that might be

224
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:23,520
there but as this practice gets strong there are seven factors that qualities characteristics

225
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,040
that become predominant in the state of the mind that we can experience

226
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:36,000
different ones of them at different times and sometimes kind of all of them together and these are the seven factors

227
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,359
awakening mindfulness investigation effort joy tranquility

228
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:48,800
samadhi and equanimity and these all have different functions

229
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:56,800
they work in different ways as a state of mind mindfulness creates real stability

230
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,839
and uh it's kind of like what there's my that would say differently if the mind just doesn't waver

231
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:07,839
it's not agitated and jumping around when mindfulness becomes a little bit more or awareness becomes a little more a

232
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:13,359
state that's present rather than something that we have to keep renewing but i keep making the

233
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:19,760
effort having the intention to be mindful so there's unwaveringness of

234
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:26,880
of attention investigation or this ability to see clearly to look

235
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,640
up and see clearly or intimately experience not by analyzing it or

236
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:39,040
probing but by like tuning into the frequency of the radio and not having

237
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:46,800
any more static just really feeling it and sensing more fully that what's going on that's of that function

238
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,640
is really important for the process of liberation they say that's the most important

239
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:59,280
of the seven factors for liberation because we have to get things really into focus

240
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,800
and then the effort factor that can see the difference between wholesome and also unwholesome

241
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:11,520
is really key in not being trapped by the unwholesome by but finding

242
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:18,000
a certain kind of healthy escape or stepping away from into the wholesome

243
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,520
joy is provides a deep satisfaction a deep contentment a bodily and physically that

244
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:33,280
is really kind of feels good and then the last three tranquility

245
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:41,280
and samadhi and equanimity are particularly useful

246
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:48,319
and so the joy factor as well these are all feelings of pleasure a well-being positive feelings

247
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:55,839
that we can have that are tremendous support for practice in helping free us from some of our

248
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:01,920
addictive patterns some of our attachments attachments to pleasure attachments to all kinds of things where

249
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:08,640
we searching if we think we're searching for happiness by having more money or more status or more relationships or

250
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:16,240
more something that's outside of us and that drive can be addictive at times

251
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:23,680
and and um or the strong uh ways in which fear operates from us inside of us that

252
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:29,760
itself is compels us to act certain ways and be certain ways and anxiety

253
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:36,319
phobias and there's something about being settled in these positive factors these states

254
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:41,359
of mind of joy tranquility samadhi and equanimity that is so

255
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,920
nourishing feels so wholesome that feels like so such a source of well-being

256
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:54,720
that it creates a reconditioning factor it conditions us in new ways rather than

257
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,079
being conditioned by fear or a feeling of lack or feeling of

258
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:05,760
being deprived or feeling unsafe for all kinds of ways which life has kind of

259
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,119
conditioned us to be we're starting to recondition ourselves and then it becomes

260
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:16,640
easier to begin letting go of some of the dysfunctional ways in which we might be living

261
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:22,000
and so rather than only relying on mindfulness seeing clearly recognizing what's happening

262
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,240
to free us from some of our conditioning which is very hard to only rely on

263
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:34,079
mindfulness but to really have the mindfulness support this process of settling and

264
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:40,240
stability and growth in the dharma to begin eventually and it eventually is an

265
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:47,280
important word here so we don't get impatient start kind of getting nourished

266
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,359
by these wholesome qualities and way of being and the last of these is equanimity and

267
00:43:53,359 --> 00:44:00,079
equanimity for many people who are unfamiliar with this idea and buddhism

268
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:07,119
will think that equanimity is kind of maybe aloof or kind of dry or kind of not really relevant for

269
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,800
having a good time in life and uh and maybe even not relevant for making

270
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,240
ourselves safe in this world if we're equanimists how do we make ourselves safe

271
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:24,720
the um and um but

272
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:32,000
uh and i think when i was before i became a buddhist practitioner i don't think i had any i used the word

273
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,160
equanimity in any kind of way in my vocabulary i probably knew what it meant some somewhat

274
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:44,400
but it had no relevance for how i lived my life or how i talked about thought about myself but certainly with practice and

275
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:50,079
meditation equanimity became has become a more and more important quality something that i recognize

276
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,119
and appreciate it kind of as a state there's this kind of feeling that

277
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,800
courses through my whole body a kind of stability and clarity and

278
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,960
openness and and the kind of a freedom that comes with equanimity and it's considered to be one of the

279
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:13,200
most sublime uh states of being that a person can experience

280
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:19,599
it's kind of kind of considered the crown jewel of the seven factors of awakening which themselves are the crown

281
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,880
jewels so you know it's that that's

282
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,480
just letting you know that if you're practicing develops over time maybe you'll start

283
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,800
feeling how special this equity manufacturer is and the rich emotional aspect it's not

284
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:45,040
indifference or aloofness or dryness and the equanimity factor

285
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:51,920
word it belongs to a family of concepts and states that uh

286
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:59,359
is championed by buddhism and uh one of them is this uh equanimity which is upeka

287
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:05,599
in pali another one is a mouthful of words that means literally

288
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:11,760
something like etymology of it standing in the middle of it all standing in the middle of this

289
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,160
and that's often seen as a sense of balance and then there's a word sama which maybe is cognitively related

290
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,000
to our word same i'm not sure about this how these languages

291
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:32,240
connect they're distant relatives of each other english and and pali and some uh

292
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:39,200
can mean can mean something like even it can mean also like light like the same but uh even

293
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:45,119
balanced also but an evenness of mind and uh it's related to some is related

294
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:50,160
to words samana s-a-m-e-n-a which

295
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,200
means either impartiality or sometimes it's

296
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:01,040
that translated as justice so impartiality that uh like the impartial

297
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,960
justice the impartial judging of things is considered a really high ideal and uh

298
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:14,079
to treat people in a certain impartiality doesn't mean indifference it means that we treat everyone kind of equally and it's kind

299
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:21,359
of the equal so it's some as equal or same or sameness so an evenness of mind an impartiality

300
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:26,400
of mind a balance of heart and mind balance of body and mind

301
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:33,440
and equanimity and for now i will just uh

302
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:42,160
say briefly a little bit about equanimity and then pick up this topic tomorrow and because it's so important

303
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:48,800
and the word for equanimity upeka upe kkha

304
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:55,040
is the etymology of the word is actually quite useful here

305
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:01,359
it literally means something to have it like to have an overview to have the bird's eye view of what's

306
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:07,599
happening um so it involves a kind of wisdom that comes from seeing how things are

307
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:15,359
so it's a kind of a wisdom factor it's not just something that arises because the quality of

308
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:22,480
some kind of inner balance is strong but rather it also comes from the strength of mindfulness

309
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,760
investigation all these other factors and then being able to not be pulled for

310
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:33,839
against things not quickly become impartial not quickly be reactive to experience but have a

311
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:39,520
stability that allows us to have the overview and wisdom operates

312
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:46,880
wisdom can see that oh that's being pulled into things i don't need to do that that's my anger i don't have to get pick

313
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:52,400
it up and get involved that's pain i've been i know about pain

314
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:59,839
i've meditated with pain for a long time and i know i'm better off not getting pulled into its orbit and

315
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:05,760
preoccupied by it or reactive to it and so there's a little bit of wisdom operating with this

316
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,040
overview having the big picture of how it works and um

317
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:18,160
so um so it belongs to the the aspect of mindfulness

318
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:23,200
where we can begin observing what's going on it's a little bit like it's a little bit like

319
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:30,800
you know stepping back and having the big picture or being up in a hilltop maybe looking down or the

320
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:37,359
experience that i had this wonderful experience that was very valuable for me many years ago was a

321
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:44,960
second year in college first time i was living with college roommates and little department and the little

322
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:50,880
apartment had a deck uh out the living room and one day i was out somehow i was out in the deck

323
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,400
with living room sliding door closed and two of my roommates were having an animated i think a friendly enough

324
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,920
animated conversation in the living room and i couldn't hear anything they were saying

325
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,599
but i could see the animated way they were and i could feel how i was kind of

326
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:13,200
delighted seeing them but i could feel how i wasn't being

327
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:20,240
pulled around by what they were saying and how they were i wasn't getting pulled in or reactive to it i was just kind of

328
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:26,319
sitting peacefully delightfully just watching in a kind of way of equanimity

329
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:33,440
so this ability to observe and watch and maybe be delighted maybe be compassionate maybe have a

330
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,720
response that's situation appropriate because

331
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,760
of our ability to have the overview and clear seeing of what's going on

332
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,359
equanimity factor of awakening so one more talk on that tomorrow

333
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:57,119
and then we'll pick up the the pace of uh the 16 steps of anapanasati

334
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:02,160
so thank you all very much and i do look forward to being together

335
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,280
again tomorrow
