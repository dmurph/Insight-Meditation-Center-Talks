1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,680
and offer my warm greetings and and

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,719
one of the things to appreciate as we do buddhist meditation to buddhist practice is liberation

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:21,119
itself and freedom and liberation freedom takes many forms some of them we don't associate with the

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,439
grand words like liberation and and

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,760
freedom and the so things like relaxation calming

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,040
but as we relax the body and relax the mind as we comment these things there is a letting go we're

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,399
releasing of ways that the body and mind has been tight been clinging been

8
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,440
contracted and that's a variation of the

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,320
more more i don't know to say more

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:08,159
significant forms of releasing of clinging which is the buddhist liberation

11
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:15,040
to become liberated to become enlightened is to really have very deep letting go a deep releasing of clinging right down

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,720
to the core of our being and and so it's all a variation it's all

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,080
a range a spectrum of releasing something

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,880
that we're talking about here and so we relax the body and we and then to appreciate don't just

15
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,200
relax the body as we start to meditate but appreciate the consequences of the relaxation

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,799
the the the relief the openness the ease the space the the lightness

17
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,000
uh the release of vitality that might come with relaxation

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,520
uh when we relax the mental formations relax the mental activity the tensions

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,399
and the contractions of the mind uh it's not just a matter of relaxing it it's also appreciating the consequence

20
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,000
of that the greater ease or lightness or space or or openness

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,360
that might be there and so also when we let go of thinking

22
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:25,280
that that some people let go of thinking and immediately go back to the breathing as if but just take a few moments

23
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,879
to let go of thinking and to appreciate um whatever goodness that comes from the

24
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,160
space the openness the lack of contraction lacks of tightness the

25
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,280
lack of compulsion that might be there in the letting go

26
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,360
of the thoughts and so one of the ways of practicing meditation then at some point as we

27
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,720
settle in further is to just appreciate letting go letting go

28
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,720
letting go of anything the mind wants to pick up on or get involved in and just let go any kind of attention to

29
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,640
any kind of pulling attention to emotions and thoughts as much as we respect these and include

30
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,840
them as part of meditation there is an art to also letting go of any

31
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,720
preoccupation with them any prioritization of them any extra interest or even any interest in

32
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,519
them everything is allowed to be as it is we're not dismissing anything what we're

33
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,879
really letting go of is the clinging to things the tightening and the tension around

34
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,000
what's happening so at some point meditation just the process of letting go

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,680
letting go letting go and and uh so

36
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,439
assuming a meditation posture

37
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,200
and i often suggest closing the eyes at the

38
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,640
beginning of meditation and as you do so you might take a moment

39
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,159
to see if you can appreciate how the relief for the eyes not to be

40
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,439
engaged in looking and seeing maybe there's a that gives a

41
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,639
kind of a rest for the eyes and if the eyes are not don't feel

42
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:28,160
restful maybe it's possible to um

43
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:35,199
let the eyes eyes rest in their sockets almost as if you're looking down

44
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:44,320
and backwards and then taking a few

45
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:52,160
somewhat deeper breaths so you can really let go and relax on the exhale

46
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,840
really emphasizing softening the body

47
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:11,199
calming the agitations of the body

48
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,680
and then letting the breath return to normal

49
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,720
and then to as you exhale to continue to relax the

50
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:36,800
body calm the body but to take a few moments to feel

51
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:46,960
the goodness whatever nice feelings this greater vitality that come from relaxing

52
00:05:47,520 --> 00:06:07,840
feel the resulting calmness tranquility in that part of your body

53
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,960
relaxing the shoulders the belly

54
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,840
the face

55
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:03,840
sometimes it's possible to relax the whole body

56
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,840
and sometimes it's possible to calm

57
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,960
a body-wide feeling of agitation

58
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:45,440
a calming wave through the body with as you exhale

59
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,800
and also gently tenderly as you exhale

60
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:58,319
to relax any agitation calm any agitation in the mind the

61
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,280
mental activity

62
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,599
letting go relaxing any tension or contraction in the mind

63
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:27,840
or in the or in that part of the body associated with your mental activity

64
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:41,839
to calm the agitation of the mind

65
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,640
and then to let go of your thoughts or at least let go of your involvement

66
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:04,000
with your thinking appreciate

67
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,360
that there's more space in the mind to be aware

68
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:17,120
when we let go of our thinking and let that space of awareness

69
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,839
be filled with the experience of breathing

70
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:37,839
breathing in and breathing out

71
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,839
and then as we continue sitting this morning with every exhale

72
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:15,839
say the word letting go let go not as a command

73
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,120
but as a invitation

74
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:29,120
for us to let go of something that the mind is has taken up

75
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:37,600
to let go of the energy of holding on or picking up or being involved in anything at all

76
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:45,760
just let go and on the inhale appreciate

77
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,800
the goodness the spaciousness the openness

78
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,320
of that letting go

79
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,480
letting go and the exhale

80
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,760
appreciating

81
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,640
the good results of letting go

82
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:29,839
and just keep letting go as if for these minutes meditation

83
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:37,839
everything that arises everything that you know nurses known

84
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:46,880
is another thing to let go of to be open and fresh for the next moment

85
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:57,839
just let go

86
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:45,839
let go

87
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:59,279
let go as if letting go is the most important thing to do nothing to hold on

88
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:07,760
to nothing to be concerned about

89
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,839
just let go

90
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,839
so

91
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,839
so

92
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,480
what are you not letting go of

93
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:59,840
what can you still let go of to be thorough and letting go

94
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
um

95
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
so

96
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,840
so

97
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
so

98
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:29,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

99
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:38,080
perhaps to appreciate the greater letting go there is

100
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:44,158
the more space there is for love

101
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,919
the more space there is for good will kindness

102
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:02,720
tenderness the more there is the opposite of love

103
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:11,360
the less room there is for love

104
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:19,919
the more time and space is taken up with clinging and reacting and being preoccupied

105
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,840
they're less time there is less space there is for friendliness

106
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,919
not the love or friendliness that is an obligation or something we have to

107
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,840
muster up but rather something deeper more

108
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,639
simple and that comes out of the tenderness gentleness

109
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:53,840
of our hearts our minds

110
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:04,840
to let go so that without work and without

111
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,720
obligation we can receive other people into our

112
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,519
hearts in the place where there's tender friendliness

113
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,559
sometimes in buddhism there's an expression tender compassion

114
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:41,600
and again without any obligations or is there a place in your heart

115
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:49,279
in the simplicity of being here having let go

116
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,520
where your heart's tender good will

117
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:00,720
could if it wanted to be expressed in the words

118
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,799
may others be happy

119
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,840
may others be safe

120
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,000
may others be peaceful

121
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,840
may others be free

122
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,759
and may i live a life

123
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,840
that supports that to happen

124
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,240
may this meditation practice we've done together today

125
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:00,640
may it be so that we can live a life that benefits

126
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:08,559
and supports the welfare and happiness of all beings

127
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:27,840
may all beings be happy and free

128
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,740
[Music]

129
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:45,039
so then we come to the 12th step of the 16 steps

130
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:50,480
of anapanasati the practice of mindfulness breathing in

131
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:58,799
and mindfully breathing out and the 12 step is breathing in

132
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:06,799
one liberates the mind breathing out one liberates the mind

133
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:13,520
and so it's the 12th step out of the 16th so it's usually said not to be the full

134
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,200
complete possibility of liberation that buddhism champions but it is a significant

135
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:26,559
experience of freedom of liberation of letting go that

136
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:32,880
that that makes an impression on the mind makes an impression on us it's

137
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,679
educational it's opening it's inspiring it kind of begins pointing the way now we know something

138
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:51,840
we didn't know before and the um

139
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,240
so the um

140
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:08,799
now remember it's a 12 step so what that means is that the first 11 steps are in a

141
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:16,240
sense a preparation for this step if we simply heard the only instruction for buddhism is to

142
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,519
let go let go let go i don't know if that would be so useful for people to hear

143
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:28,399
and also it might not give the right idea of what letting go is about it

144
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:36,320
might feel like oh just let go of everything i have and have nothing as a result and be impoverished impoverished in some way

145
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:43,440
and if i let go there's nothing left and i'll just be kind of depressed and miserable or something

146
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:50,000
the letting go happens after the first 11 steps which are preparing the ground and

147
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:58,840
opening the field and setting up a sense of well-being where letting go has a very wonderful

148
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:06,399
context and we understand the tremendous value of letting go because of the wholesomeness the

149
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:13,600
beneficial states that we're experiencing so so to kind of review this little bit

150
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,720
how to contact how context is set up for letting go

151
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,480
so the practice begins with just simply mindfully breathing in and out helping the mind calm down helping the

152
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,240
mind get focused helping us to show up and be present for our experience and i think

153
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,440
for most people that's where the bulk of the practice is even people who practice for a long time

154
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,799
they sit down to meditate and they're they're at step one and two

155
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:45,919
and uh and uh this idea that there's a progress you're supposed to always be at the

156
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:54,559
growing edge of this 12 16 steps is a kind of a just unnecessary

157
00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:00,880
source of stress and and misunderstanding and it's easy easy than to miss ourselves in

158
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,080
the process and not really connect to ourselves the idea in mindfulness practice is to really

159
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:13,279
become ourselves be ourselves really be honest about what's here and learn how to rest and be present for it

160
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:19,360
and this idea of just breathing in and out through it all is a way of supporting us to not resist

161
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,640
not try to escape not try to avoid what is here but to really

162
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,399
be present and face what's here and work through it and just breathe with it and relax and

163
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:36,799
heal and open up and and release the things that have to be released

164
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:43,120
and but as we do this practice then at some point we begin feeling recognizing that we can relax the body

165
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,559
sometimes the body just relaxes itself in meditation often you don't have to do the relaxing

166
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,720
but the mind body becomes more tranquil more calm and and that's a feels like a good thing

167
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:01,360
and the more we practice the more calm and relaxed the body becomes as the body becomes calmer and more

168
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:07,440
relaxed let go some of the tension we have some of those feelings of well-being can

169
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:14,480
well up the sense of contentment the ease relaxation itself is can bring a kind of joy and happiness

170
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:22,079
and so the practice begins kind of inching its way into feeling some joy happiness contentment well-being

171
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,919
that sets the stage to better appreciate the tensions of the mind the

172
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:33,040
mental activity how there's the stresses that are there and so then the practice when we start

173
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,440
seeing that we start relaxing the mental activities calming the agitation of the mind

174
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,480
relaxing the mind relaxing the mental muscle the thinking

175
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:51,040
muscle and and so the mental activities which can be swirling around and be fragmented

176
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:57,599
and uh be going off in different directions begin to settle down and the mental activity starts coming

177
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:05,520
into harmony with itself and in in harmony and unity with the settling process of meditation

178
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,640
and then we come into the third tetrad all having to do with the mind the

179
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,079
cheetah and the cheetah can be understood as the heart mind

180
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,839
it's kind of like our inner life you know it's uh not would not be

181
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,119
appropriate buddhist term but maybe for a way some people some

182
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,359
modern people use the word soul kind of the deepest kind of places inside our

183
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:40,640
inside our psyche inside of ourselves it might also be the soul kind of them but the mind the heart the

184
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,079
mind heart is you know what buddhists talk about

185
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:52,240
and uh so we start recognizing that we have this inner life this inner mind this inner

186
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,760
quality of life the mood state that's inside and we start becoming the caretaker on

187
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,880
that and because of the earlier steps of panasati

188
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,280
this begins to feel good to be connected to this deep you know if i use the western word soul

189
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,040
to really for some people i think really kind of feels like a homecoming more than if you say say mind

190
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,400
or heart but uh does heart mind really feel oh this is good this inner state

191
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,680
the state of being and there can be a gladness of satisfaction a deep satisfaction deep

192
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:31,280
contentment of being home being connected to something deep that's not kind of

193
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,560
spinning around on the surface of our thoughts and ideas and scattered in our mind but we're really

194
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,839
starting to feel whole and unified and that process of becoming unified and

195
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:49,119
unscattered undispersed continues into the 11th step with with samadhi with unification with

196
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:55,920
steadying this whole mind state comes and gets gathered together and and there's a lot of well-being that can

197
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,960
come some of the greatest forms of joy and happiness come from samadhi from a mind that's

198
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:08,160
unified and settled and connected so by the time we get to the step 12

199
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,560
letting go liberating the mind the um there's just a tremendous amount

200
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:22,560
of of uh well-being there's a feeling of being really at home connected and so rather than

201
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:30,480
letting go being an impoverishment a diminishment of ourselves it's we start really seeing that what

202
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,760
we're letting go of is in fact what diminishes us is in fact what impoverishes us that

203
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,960
there's something about the mind getting caught and preoccupied

204
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:50,800
obsessing about things spinning around in thoughts and ideas holding on to fear oddly enough we can

205
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,800
cling to fear uh clinging to upper to resistance clinging to

206
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:05,119
all kinds of things that we resist and hold on to and cling for dear life clinging to self and self-image

207
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:12,640
clinging to hurt all kinds of things that people will cling to but it's seen

208
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:19,280
on this reservoir on this foundation of well-being of goodness of freedom or

209
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:27,680
clarity and so it's really clear that that clinging is is a separation from that well-being

210
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:34,880
letting go just feels like of course i'll let go letting go so obviously a diminishment

211
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,599
so obviously a source of suffering so obviously a source of stress of course i'll let go

212
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:48,400
and so sometimes the letting go the liberation that happens here is uh so innate that it's not something

213
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,520
we have to do we just keep staying present breathing with the experience

214
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,240
and and just letting things be letting things be and something will just let go by itself

215
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,480
because it takes a certain kind of mental involvement

216
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,960
to remain clinging and if we just let things be let things be even our clinging

217
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:20,000
it will self-liberate at some point the self-liberating capacity of all

218
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:28,320
things and so so we come to the the 12th step and

219
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:34,240
uh we come to the time of liberation of letting go and it's at this point where some people

220
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:40,880
find it just really a wonderful thing to just sometimes when you sit down to meditate

221
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:48,560
just let go let go let go just whatever arises let it go let it be

222
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,640
let it be don't be involved don't pick it up don't get reactive to it don't pull away

223
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:02,640
just let go let it be let it be let it go and um and um

224
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:10,560
you know and so we let go of everything let go of even we let go of even

225
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:18,480
mindfulness being aware we let go of self we could get let go of knowing we let go of um even letting go

226
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,560
at some point just let go and don't and let go of being the agent

227
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,480
of it let go of having an agenda let go of trying to be complete

228
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,240
or getting enlightened even um just let go let go there's some that's as if that's

229
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:44,160
all there is let go of um of uh needing to let go even

230
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:51,119
just wherever it is possible the next moment let go of this let go this um

231
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,838
and um so um

232
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,640
so this twelfth step of an apanasati breathing in liberating the mind

233
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,480
breathing out liberating the mind so that's um

234
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:16,400
and that is the is the entryway to the last four steps of an apanasati

235
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,480
and so letting go and liberation here is not in you know the end of the

236
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,800
story but in some ways it's the beginning of a story and they say that some sometimes it said in

237
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,160
kind of folklore buddhism that the buddhist path really begins

238
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:41,119
when we have a qualitative experience of letting go of liberation that we know oh this is what it's about

239
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:47,680
this is what freedom is possible this is what really feels good and feels inspiring and feels

240
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:55,599
this is worth and this is such a qualitatively good

241
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,760
experience such a rich experience such an experience that's filled with potential for compassion and

242
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:08,240
love and freedom and goodness and lack of causing harm wanting to cause harm in

243
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:17,760
the world this is a good thing so um so um

244
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:25,119
that's where we are on this process and we'll continue it um on monday and uh

245
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:31,359
and and over this weekend uh why don't you uh talk to some friends

246
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:38,400
about what they've learned about how letting go is useful and when letting go is useful have

247
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,000
conversations about the benefits of letting go and how letting go can be done in

248
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,800
wise ways and and look for opportunities to let go look to look and really start to explore

249
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,160
all the different dimensions that you can find of when and how and where letting go

250
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:02,078
operates for you or can operate for you and if we do that then

251
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:13,838
we'll have a better foundation for our continuing our adventure on next week monday thank you
