1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:11,799
so I'd like to mention the obvious

2
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:16,800
that we're kind of coming into an historical moment in this country that

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,160
we're all participating in with the election on

4
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:28,760
Tuesday and um I wanted to say some words about that relevant for this times

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,600
that we're in and um I thought I would like to start where

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,760
I've never started a Dhat talk before is start with a

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,960
prayer but then I thought I should introduce the prayer with another

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,399
prayer or at least a poem and

9
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,520
uh and the reason for this is that um coming out of the meditation

10
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,440
now uh it was so clear to me how meditation can provide us with a

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,920
radically different orientation for how to be in the world than if all then it

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:17,920
is if we're only being pushed or LED or by the world of

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,600
our thinking if we're only swimming in the Labyrinth of thoughts the Maze of

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,400
thoughts and ideas and Concepts uh there's a kind of a way in which there's no way out

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,360
uh it's kind of an endless um you know imagine the on wraps and

16
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,680
off- wraps of a freeway that we're just a figure eight soon as you get get off you're on again and it takes you back

17
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,000
and around and around and there's no exit and there's rush hour traffic and

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,039
you're slowly making your way around and around there's something about getting caught in the world of thoughts ideas

19
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:01,880
Concepts which um uh leaves us in a very difficult

20
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,880
world uh very difficult world of the projections we have about the future the

21
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,520
memories of the past what we think our needs are a world in which we're

22
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,640
focusing on objects of attention objects of our hostility objects of our desires

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,360
objects of our fears and to have that thinking mind quiet BEC Stiller and

24
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:33,720
quieter so that something deeper can arise from the wells Springs within we

25
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,840
have we're amazingly um wondrous

26
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,280
beings wondrous beings of emotions of feelings of

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,480
Heart of uh sources of wisdom creativity and to be able to meet the

28
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:01,319
world with the wondrous parts of who we are rather than the scared parts of who we are the wondrous parts of who we are

29
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:07,519
rather than the parts of us that are consumed with preoccupations that we

30
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:15,239
have and uh and to be oriented to this historical moment from this deeper Place

31
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,640
rather than the Maze of thoughts and ideas and projections and fears and just

32
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:29,840
that you know the the media the social you know the way that we could relate to often to uh our news these days or the

33
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,280
way we can so so many people now connect to the whole world through a screen I think it more

34
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,720
often uh puts people up in the Maze of thoughts and reactions and ideas that's

35
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,920
place where we get caught and we're kind of maybe even working on on the habits

36
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:56,079
of mind that keeps us caught and so to step out of this screen world out of the maze world into this

37
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:01,560
deep wondrous world that we are is the is the shift of orientation that gives

38
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,480
us a very different understanding of what it means to be alive what it means to be participating in our

39
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,400
society so in preparation for

40
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:20,840
the poem that I'll read and I'll tell you the poem that I

41
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:28,120
wrote there's a prayer that I wrote or write I adapted it so it became a prayer

42
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,680
in the the 20 00s there was a presidential candidate running for

43
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:41,400
president by the name of Dennis kusich congressman from Ohio and he was a one of the great proponents of Peace

44
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,880
work in the world and and uh he wanted to there to be a peace core like a like

45
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,160
a Peace Corp but it was people got trained like in they got trained in military to fight they get trained in a

46
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:00,560
kind of a peace military for doing peace work in the world and uh and he wanted a peace award

47
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,639
in 2010 I think but he anyway he was running for president and a friend of

48
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:13,560
mine invited me to come have dinner with him he was going to be in the area and

49
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,400
if I would do kind of a prayer for the at the dinner so that's all I knew and I'd been to her house and it wasn't that big of a

50
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,680
house so I I'd been had eaten at her at her dining room table it wasn't that big

51
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,960
so I didn't think there'd be that many people there it turned out I didn't know she had a big

52
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,360
backyard and so it turned out the whole backyard was everything was in the backyard with you know was a whole

53
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,800
catered with tables and PE and there were a lot of people there it was a political event you know like she'd got

54
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,120
all her friends to come to hear him give a talk and all that so suddenly I you know I don't know about

55
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:57,199
prayers you know that's not my forte and uh but I I was asked to do it

56
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,319
so what I'm going to read you is for what I read kind of for his sake running

57
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:08,919
for president and um and I've adopted it a few times now but in preparation

58
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:18,360
for for that I want to read a poem by Joy harjo the eagle poem it's called and it

59
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,880
says something about prayer to

60
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:34,639
pray you open your whole self to Sky to Earth to Sun to

61
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:43,240
Moon to the whole voice that is you and know there is more that you

62
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,479
can't see can't hear can't know except in moments

63
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:59,680
steadily growing and in languages that aren't always sound but other Circles of motion

64
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,680
like Eagle that Sunday morning over Salt

65
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,840
River circled in Blue Sky in Wind swept

66
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,840
our hearts clean with sacred Wings we see you see

67
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:26,639
ourselves and know that we must take the utmost care

68
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,919
and kindness in all things breathe

69
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:40,560
in knowing we are made of all this and breathe knowing we are truly

70
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,240
blessed because we were born and die soon within a true circle

71
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,759
of motion like Eagle rounding out the morning inside

72
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:00,000
us we pray that it will be done in Beauty

73
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,520
in Beauty so Joy Hardo is one of the great

74
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,840
Native American poets in this country so this is a very different

75
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:19,759
understanding of prayer what it means to pray so in Beauty in

76
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:29,479
Beauty so this is a prayer now for civic involvement

77
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,360
as we participate in our democracy may we be guided by the 10

78
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,200
virtues of Civic life may we be

79
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:50,279
generous so everyone is supported may we have

80
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:58,399
integrity so everyone can trust us may we renounce selfish interest so

81
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,680
everyone benefits may we be honest so everyone hears what

82
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:11,200
is true may we be kind so everyone can

83
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:18,760
relax may we have self-control so everyone everyone may be

84
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,920
safe may we be free of ill will so everyone can speak

85
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,800
freely may we be nonviolent so everyone feels

86
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,600
valued may we be patient so everyone can participate in their own

87
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,360
way may we not obstruct obstruct so that we can learn how to

88
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:50,640
work together so this so those are 10 10 uh

89
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,440
qualities that in that classic Buddhist uh tradition are called the 12 uh

90
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:05,560
qualities of a uh ruler of a monarch and um but there's a certain

91
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:12,440
kind of way that in the United States that uh we're all meant to be

92
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:18,920
participants in a democracy that uh as equals in a way

93
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,279
that makes us all in a certain kind of way uh

94
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:30,040
monarchs makes us all somehow participants in this life here

95
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:37,639
and so in the civic responsibility Civic engagement and uh and so what are the

96
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,839
principles that guide that kind of involvement that are not simply the

97
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:49,320
pursuit of power not simply the pursuit of being right and O and conquering

98
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,720
others winning over others is there another way is there a way of

99
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,120
cooperation is there a way of having differences and finding a third way that works for everyone

100
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,160
I've kind of staked my DOT Life as a Buddhist on the idea

101
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:13,440
that if we spend enough time in in conflict and difficulties that you can

102
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,279
find a way that supports everyone it's not a win- lose situation

103
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:26,200
but it takes it's a challenge to find that I've been in situations where I've been in conflict with people around

104
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:33,800
something and we're having a maybe a somewhat intense conv ation about it and the other person some point says

105
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,720
well have it your way and I said no we can't do

106
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,600
that um this is actually very important I think if we stay in it and stay in the

107
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,120
intensity of it without being hostile long enough to see if we can find a way

108
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,399
that is a Third Way something that we haven't thought about yet not your way

109
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:04,240
not my way but maybe there's a way that fits fit us fits us both and U because I've seen that happen

110
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,920
repeatedly if you're willing to stay in the difficulty and sometimes it takes a long time but this idea of a third

111
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:19,519
way that has everyone's well-being in account is it

112
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,279
naive but I've seen it work in small ways I've seen it I've seen this kind of

113
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:33,800
these things are possible and uh and so not one where power and being right and winning is the

114
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:41,519
first and foremost effort of the thing but rather to be cooperative to have conversations find a

115
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,000
way so um some people you know can they come to Buddhism they're hoping that

116
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,839
Buddhism has important things to say about everything in life and the Buddha didn't have much to

117
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,880
say about Civic life that's relevant for our our world today unless you take some

118
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,920
of the core ethical principles and apply them to Civic life but the Buddha uh was

119
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:12,120
alive at a time that was radically different than our life I it was the Bronze Age just to hear you Buddha lived

120
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:19,480
in the Bronze Age and uh there was no democracies in India at that time maybe there was

121
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:26,800
burgeoning democracy in Greece at that time maybe but even that was kind of very different than what we have

122
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,160
today and um and you know there were there were kings that ruled back then

123
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,279
who were kind of like dictators uh you know to stand up and

124
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:43,360
protest to a King back in the time of the Buddha there there the ancient texts

125
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,440
give graphic depictions which I won't provide you with um of what the king

126
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,560
would do to you you know with no hesitation and so the um you know there

127
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,199
was no democracy there was no courts per se that we have today there was no laws

128
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:09,959
in the same way we have today that you can rely on it was all in the whims of a ruler and what happened to the great

129
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:16,320
extent and um and U you know there were no social

130
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,519
services for you know to go to and no and uh no social security no retirement

131
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:28,000
money you know there was people weren't provided for by the government there were not no nonprofits that were there

132
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,040
to set up soup kit and take care of things in some ways um it was so

133
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,680
radically different and so and also the the ways people communicated in the ways

134
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,560
that people affected each other was to a big part what you could see was the

135
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,000
human human interactions human connections to each other and so when the Buddha talked

136
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,440
about how to live together he talked about the visible world the the behavior

137
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:02,680
the conduct that we had that everyone could see they could see if they killed each other

138
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:10,120
and he said don't do that you could see if they were stealing from each other and he said this is not a good idea you

139
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:17,759
can kind of see or know in some ways unless it was done too secretly uh you know uh uh with the sexual

140
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,000
misconduct that's a form of behavior between people there was

141
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,480
lying not telling the truth people could hear it and then there was problems that

142
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,040
came from intoxication which generally you kind of see it if people are too

143
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,680
intoxicated so it was all that that's the world that they were swimming in back then in the Bronze

144
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,160
Age but now we have a society where we affect each other by how we

145
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,519
vote and uh it can have huge impact we have we can affect each other by how we

146
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:56,600
participate in social media and what we add there what we say and the effect that we have on people in the world

147
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,120
around us now is invisible it's we don't even see the effect we have we affect

148
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,920
others by what we consume and then we affect the world by what happens when after we flush it down

149
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:15,279
the toilet or after we put it in the trash so most people don't think about once it's gone it's gone we don't think

150
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:22,319
about it but how we live our alive has an effect that if that is not visible to us and so it gets more and more

151
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:29,000
complicated how this all works and so this comes into play with

152
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,680
civic responsibility phys Civic Civic involvement where the effect SP spills

153
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:41,360
out in all kinds of different ways and so uh to be careful is not just

154
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:48,639
to avoid killing stealing sexual misconduct lying and intoxication it involves some deeper

155
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,880
principles some deeper care all in Buddhist point of view all

156
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,639
Guided by the wish to not cause harm and how do we not cause harm in unseen ways

157
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:07,160
how do we not cause harm and that's the primary motivation around ethics and

158
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:14,000
Buddhism is to live a life of non-harming so these uh 10 principles

159
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,600
that were originally designed for encouraging Kings to to rule well which

160
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,798
that had then um uh adapted for 20 years

161
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:31,480
ago so for a presidential candidate and and um the best thing that happened

162
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,640
out of doing that was Dennis kinich did ask me for a

163
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:47,039
copy what that happened to that copy I have no idea but um but so um to not harm but instead

164
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:54,559
to be generous but why be generous so everyone feel supported and

165
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,080
and for there one of the primary kind of messages that Buddha seemed to have

166
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,080
wanted to give to monarchs in his time was to take care of the poor and he has

167
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:13,039
uh the Buddha gave a lot of teachings or some teachings uh that described if you don't support the poor and bring take

168
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:20,080
them out of poverty that it's going to be deleterious for the whole society the whole society will start unraveling was

169
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:26,240
his teaching so take care of the poor but take care of the poor uh so that

170
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,799
everyone is supported uh don't have it a win lose situation but Prosperity so everyone

171
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:39,960
prospers uh I think it's a fair probably a fair assessment of our of our world

172
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:47,640
that there's there's enough abundance in this world for everyone to live well but most people don't live well

173
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:55,159
because it's not shared equally and evenly even in this country here United States there's enough here I mean it's

174
00:18:55,159 --> 00:19:01,440
probably the wealth of 10 people certain 10 people we have that could probably

175
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,120
reduce poverty in this country dramatically but the concentration of wealth into a very few hands is it's

176
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:14,400
unprecedented I think and um and is it healthy for us I think there's a

177
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:21,799
plentitude so that can make everyone feel supported Pro certain certain prosperity for everyone except for those

178
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:27,520
people who have to lose maybe a few tens of billions of dollars they'll we'll feel sorry for

179
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,039
them I guess but they'll still be left with a lot but there is a you know this they of

180
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:40,880
support and everyone's in it together this they of we how do we support everyone so everyone thrives is what's

181
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:48,720
behind this this principle of be generous so everyone is supported may we have integrity so

182
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,039
everyone can trust us trust is probably the biggest wealth

183
00:19:54,039 --> 00:20:01,600
that we have or or one of the biggest wealth what if we call trust a form of wealth as opposed to money and bank

184
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,400
accounts being wealth uh I think that uh most wonderful

185
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,200
things in our society with our closest friends with our closest Family if it's healthy and well are based on the

186
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,320
foundation of trusting each other and Trust goes a long way if we have

187
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,360
integrity and people trust our integrity integrity and perhaps Integrity then

188
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:33,000
becomes contagious uh renouncing selfish interest so

189
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,880
everyone benefits so again this idea that not hoarding not just concern for

190
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,919
ourselves but concern for others and there's a way in which benefiting others

191
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:50,760
will come back and benefit ourselves uh maybe there's no economic

192
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:56,799
models or theories or data to show this directly but um there's a classic thing

193
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,240
in some some culture some of here California the Native American uh polash

194
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:09,080
cultures where they've studied theologists have studied and pointed out that what how the economics and these

195
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:16,440
cultures work in a healthy way is that the gift keeps being given and the and goods are kept in

196
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,760
circulation so fash culture was one where people would come together periodically and do a huge gift giving

197
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:30,039
kind of uh festivals rituals where they'd give to each other and lots of giving but as soon as someone then

198
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:35,440
stopped giving then it got constipated so there has to keep going

199
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:42,880
and keep going and so how do we keep a gift economy how do we keep generosity

200
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,960
how do we keep benefiting the world as something that keeps flowing we benefit

201
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,919
tremendously how do we keep the gift of how we benefit from our society uh going

202
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:00,960
so we it doesn't get bottleneck or stuck in US uh but keep keep benefiting let it

203
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,960
keep flowing there's something about the cycles of generosity of giving that uh

204
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:14,559
that is makes for a really healthy Society um may we be honest so everyone

205
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:21,320
hears the uh what is true nowadays true is truth is relevant Rel Rel considered

206
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:30,440
to be re relevant relevant relative it's still relative relative

207
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:39,120
relevant the um and um but the uh but the in Buddhism to be

208
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:46,279
uh to say the truth is to be true yourself to be a true person and a true

209
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:52,480
person doesn't lie doesn't manipulate doesn't try to uh get their own way at

210
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,559
any cost at all uh a true person is someone who has integrity and is able to

211
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:04,400
speak from that place may we be kind so everyone can

212
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:12,360
relax imagine there was a society where no one was kind would you want to live in that

213
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,559
Society imagine all the

214
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:24,279
kindness maybe I shouldn't use all imagine what you'd be like today as

215
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:31,158
a person if no one had ever been kind to

216
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:39,880
you growing up was anybody kind to you did it happen

217
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:46,480
occasionally did it make a difference for you that occasionally your parents were kind your teachers were

218
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,120
kind your friends were kind imagine if you received nothing of it what would it

219
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:58,600
be like I suspect that a lot of what's good about you was partly shaped by the kind

220
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:06,080
this you received from others and maybe from strangers even it's inconceivable to have a

221
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,120
society that isn't based on kindness and there's also the gift of

222
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,960
kindness can we keep it in circulation can we keep doing it and offering it

223
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,880
back may we have self-control so everyone may be safe one of the ideas in

224
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:30,799
Buddhism is that um we restraint is a fundamentally

225
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,919
important practice because we can't necessarily know what's going on in our

226
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:43,840
mind or we can't control the mind sometimes the impulses of the Mind the mind is a tricky

227
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:50,240
thing but we H we can have the principle in Buddhism we can have control about

228
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,200
how the mind gets expressed in action and the actions are actions of

229
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:04,880
the body the things we do with our body and what we say and now what we

230
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,919
type uh that uh the phys what we do physically we can have some we have more

231
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:17,520
control over that than what we you know our capacity to control the mind and it

232
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:24,120
counts a lot to have that degree of self-control so that you don't cause harm it does whatever is difficult in

233
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:30,679
your mind doesn't spill out and one of the reasons that not have to difficult in your mind spill out and affect others

234
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:37,559
in harmful ways is that what goes out comes back or what go what goes out

235
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:43,760
becomes a habit gets reinforced creates more discomfort more problems inside so

236
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,919
to have enough self self-control so that our behavior is not causing harm our

237
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:55,240
words don't cause harm is one of the really important principles in

238
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,760
Buddhism and it's not we not we're not meant to repress our elves that way but

239
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,480
uh but rather meditation is a way of really knowing ourselves well enough so

240
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,960
that we can really understand how to be with what's challenging inside of ourselves in a skillful way in a useful

241
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:20,960
way and one of the things that I've learned to do when I have difficulty in my mind and my my inner life with what's

242
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,840
going on is uh not to act impulsively from it but to tell people you know I'm

243
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:34,919
challenged right now you know this is really difficult for me what's happening now and and you

244
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:42,279
should probably know that I'm grumpy so you know just let's let's be careful now you know me I'll be careful

245
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:47,320
maybe you can be careful with me and until this mood that I have changes but

246
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:53,120
the ability to just be honest in a way that doesn't harm people but actually protects

247
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:01,440
people so self-control so everyone may be safe Maybe we may we be free of ill will

248
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,960
the word translated here is ill will is the ancient language probably is a stronger word than ill will it's

249
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:13,320
actually hostility so maybe they're the same or

250
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:19,919
just little variations of each other but um to not to not have hostility not act

251
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,480
from hostility I would say that's one of the Cardinal principles and Buddhist

252
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,240
ethics never act on hostility if that's in terms of self you know

253
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,840
self-control restraint if you have hostility restrain yourself bite your

254
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:43,640
tongue whatever it takes you know don't don't speak it wait come back if you

255
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:49,159
need to work something else with someone um go and process your hostility

256
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,559
on your own or in some with a friend or something until it's settled enough so

257
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:01,640
you can come back and um and have a a good conversation once I was had I was doing

258
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:07,720
a program here at IMC with a colleague and uh and I I got really

259
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:15,240
angry or we had a difficulty between us so we went into the conference room there and uh to have a little chat about

260
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,519
what was going on and um at some point it was hard conversation at some point I

261
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:27,880
said to my friend um can we pause I I think I need to calm down a

262
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:34,600
little little bit so I can come back in a more useful way in this conversation and she was fine with that you know that

263
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,799
they just I asked for it so as opposed to just feeling I had to keep fighting

264
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:46,039
back or fighting and going and going and going which probably would have been harmful for both of

265
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:52,799
us so I recognized the the ill will that I had and I said this is not good let's

266
00:28:52,799 --> 00:29:00,039
lets me find a way to settle down and calm down and it worked out fine in the end

267
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,398
may we be nonviolent so everyone feels

268
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:14,799
valued how many people in our society don't feel valued there it's

269
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,960
epidemic I think in our society here and there the people don't

270
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,799
feel valued there's some people who who it's really chronic they almost anywhere they go they don't feel valued they

271
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:33,000
don't feel respected they don't they're dignity is not allowed and

272
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:41,279
um I talked to someone recently who was a hospital chaplain who met someone a

273
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,919
homeless person who' come into the hospital and and um it seemed like that

274
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:52,240
person had never been respected and never had a friend in his whole life and

275
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,679
that's what he most wanted was to have a friend

276
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:04,880
may we be patient so everyone can participate in their own

277
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:13,320
way everyone can participate in their own way that's dangerous isn't

278
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,679
it but this is like the this is the ninth of the 10 principles so you're

279
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:24,559
building on all the others mutual respect so everyone can

280
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:30,039
find their own way and may we not

281
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:35,640
obstruct may we not hinder so that we can learn how to work

282
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:43,080
together if we offer obstruction to people if we hinder them and stop them and try to silence them then then

283
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:49,120
there's no cooperation there's no working together so how do we have conversations

284
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:55,679
so it feels like We're In It Together how do we learn to respect people how do we learn to find a

285
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,760
way so I would like to propose that

286
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:07,279
um in my reading of what's happening in this country right now there's way too

287
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:12,639
much emphasis on who's going to become the president as if that is the crucial

288
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:19,480
issue that's going to make or break the country I'd like to propose something

289
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:27,919
different I think we're coming to a a a crisis maybe for each of you what

290
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:35,080
what are you going to do how are you going to participate in the Civic life are you expecting the Civic life to

291
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:41,159
be solved by someone else out there who's going to do it all for us make

292
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:48,240
everything fine and you can continue on your life merily as it is I don't think that's the right way to

293
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:56,000
live in a democracy I think of to live in a democracy is to be participant in some

294
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:04,519
way and so how you you are is very important and and so these 10 principles

295
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:10,279
of civic participation doesn't mean you have to join a political party doesn't mean you

296
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:16,720
have to go and get involved in so-called politics but these are the ways that we

297
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:24,360
can make a better society and to start there and then if that's understood then

298
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:30,240
you can run for president I'll come and do a

299
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:37,639
prayer for you so so those are my thoughts for

300
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:45,159
today as we go so no matter what happens on Tuesday remember these 10

301
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:50,519
principles it's once in the scenarios different scenarios that people are

302
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:57,240
predicting so probably in all the scenarios that people are predicting or imagining might happen they all need

303
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:04,559
this they all need individuals and people who rely on this and maybe this will give

304
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:11,000
you some strength and some inspiration encouragement to how to go forward and U

305
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,559
and all of us contribute to a better world better

306
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,559
Society so thank you those are my thoughts on this historic

307
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:28,240
times and uh we have about 10 minutes before the end so now uh we could try to

308
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:35,880
um if you have any questions comments Reflections on what I just said

309
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:50,720
testimonials Gil thank you so much can you post that prayer or pass it out or

310
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:57,200
something I want to be able to reread it it's already posted on the homepage

311
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,799
im's weite there's a on the bottom right there's a section called what's new and

312
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:11,800
then there's Reflections from Gil as part of that and there you see it now it's already already there excellent

313
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,280
what oh the poem Joy Hardo is um it's

314
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:28,919
called The Eagle poem you can find it online I don't want to post her it's h a RJ o harjo

315
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:35,599
I think she's Cherokee a wonderful woman wonderful wonderful poet and

316
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:42,559
um and uh so Joy harjo the eagle called Eagle

317
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,839
poem and you can also actually uh find her reading her poem

318
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:59,599
online um Gil um so I I'm aware that uh

319
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:05,760
American friends or Quakers they make all their decisions by consensus but how

320
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:13,000
they do it I have no idea well sometimes it takes them a very long time and uh there there I don't know if

321
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:22,320
I have the DAT the time exactly right but I've I've been told that it took them 200 years to decide to be against

322
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:29,280
slavery you know it's kind of heartbreaking to hear that but at least they came around

323
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,400
wow but yeah consensus is really good we tried to do that things on consensus

324
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,480
here at IMC there have been times on the times on the IMC board where we've taken a

325
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,800
vote for something and one person one person doesn't isn't that they're opposed even they say you know

326
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:54,119
they just choose not to vote and I've said no no look let's not make a decision today then let's give

327
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:59,800
time for this if want we want to have everyone feel like everyone particip Ates and so at least let let's make the

328
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,200
effort at least so then we maybe reach out to that person during the before the next board meeting and just find out

329
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,720
what's going on and see if there's some way that we can make it work whatever we're going to do here so that everyone

330
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:17,960
feels they can support it and you can't but we can't expect that always but at

331
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,359
least we can make the effort for it that's respectful

332
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:45,079
yeah thank you that was a nice talk um what what kind of came up for me when

333
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:51,800
I was listening to your remarks was um the fact that I I think we live in a

334
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,040
time when there's an exceptional amount of fear and I think a lot of what we're

335
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,240
seeing um behind it is is fear which is usually

336
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:09,839
a very um unhelpful emotion when it comes

337
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:15,400
to you know doing all the the wholesome things you describe and I wonder if you

338
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:21,920
could comment on that especially you know the tension between wanting to

339
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,839
engage positively um and at the same time maybe being a little afraid for ourselves of

340
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:34,720
what could happen you know there are thank you for

341
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:42,000
the question there are many many ways that the fears in our society can be and

342
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,319
maybe should be addressed and um and you know small Buddhist organization like us or a

343
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:56,880
Buddhist practitioner by themselves uh cannot address all the different ways that can be or should be done but one of

344
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,960
the special is that Buddhism offers is the ability to come to terms with our

345
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:08,200
own fear to really be able to look at it deeply settle it come to some place

346
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:14,640
where our fear doesn't no longer blocks us no longer gets in our way there still

347
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:20,359
might be fear but we now find learn how to be free uh so we can be wise with

348
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:25,800
whatever fear we carry uh or our Fe our fear is sett

349
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:32,200
settled uh and we can live without any anxiety and uh there might be some fear

350
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:38,280
but no anxiety that's a kind of radical thing so the idea of looking really

351
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,640
knowing ourselves and learning how to become free of our own fear is a part of

352
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:51,000
the gift of this practice that we do the other side of that is um to

353
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,040
become a person who others don't have to fear to be someone who can walk through

354
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:03,560
the world World safe A friend of everyone someone no one no one is afraid and sometimes people are afraid for us

355
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:11,359
even though we're a safe person they don't know that they might see you as belonging to a group of people that

356
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:19,680
historically has been harmful to them and so it's hard for them to distinguish between uh who's safe and who's not but

357
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,319
to really work on not taking for granted that people feel would think that you're

358
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:30,400
automatically a safe person but how can you be a safe person how could you show

359
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:37,079
up in a friendly way or in a so that so we give people the gift of

360
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:46,760
fearlessness and um and I think it's a great gift gift to our society and um and again uh you know to

361
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:53,920
expect that other people are going to make the everyone safe you

362
00:39:54,599 --> 00:40:00,520
know it's a bit I think it we can expect it if you want that

363
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:06,000
someone else is going to do the work um but uh you have to do it

364
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,560
too so how do you come to terms with your fear how do you develop yourself in

365
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:20,960
such a way that you can walk through the world and be safe for people you have the confidence to be able to show up in

366
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,440
a way and and feel safe even if people are angry with you you know you have some way of being how can you do that

367
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,760
that it's not easy but that's why this practice can help that

368
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:38,560
tremendously so uh to go deep into this practice is part of the answer for

369
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,760
you is that is that adequate to

370
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:47,119
answer

371
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:58,200
can thank you hi well as you just said what well

372
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:04,440
what bothers me sometimes is when I talk the people I talk to about this sort of

373
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:10,160
thing there's an overwhelming sense of I'm one

374
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:17,440
person I can't do anything and can't make an impact and I just want to say that when I sit on the cushion I have

375
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,960
kind of a ritual where I set my intention why am I there and I say to

376
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:31,040
myself may this meditation make me stronger so I am a Force for good in the

377
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,440
world and better the life of everyone I come in contact with and everyone they

378
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,960
come in contact with and it just goes on from there nice but um I I just like you

379
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:50,400
just said we can make a difference even though we're only one person yeah every

380
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,480
every individual can make a difference and um there's a lovely story that I

381
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:03,200
love of um it's a Sufi story story of some I guess some kind of maybe God or a

382
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:09,440
Genie or something some Spirit offers this this man um two wishes you can have

383
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,359
anything you want and um and so he says well wherever

384
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:21,920
I go I want to benefit the people around me that's the first wish the second wish

385
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,960
but I don't know I don't want to know that I'm doing it

386
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:33,440
and so he's given a bag uh of a big bag that he carries over his shoulder filled

387
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:40,599
with seeds and there's a little hole in the bag and it's always being replenished by the spirits or something

388
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:45,839
but wherever he walks those seeds fall out and they germinate and grow to

389
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:52,920
something flowers or trees or fruit apple trees or something and uh so it takes a long time

390
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,920
for that to happen he's long gone you know he keeps walking and and so symbolically you know we can always make

391
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,640
a difference but we don't necessarily see the actual results of making a

392
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:11,040
difference um the um I've Been Changed by total

393
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:18,319
strangers who spent five minutes with me and their kindness and support just wow

394
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:24,400
I felt like that was inspiring that's possible can be done this way and um and

395
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:31,839
they never knew that they had such a big impact on me we don't know when we're gonna have an impact we don't know when

396
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:38,559
um you know that uh we we're kind to a local kid who's kind of having a lot of

397
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:43,599
challenges maybe no one's ever been kind to the kid and there's a glimmer of hope

398
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:51,359
for that person than they never had before so this we don't know what seeds we're

399
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:58,440
planting but let's plant seeds anyway and who knows what'll happen

400
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:04,119
who knows the influence you have we have more influence than we realize if we are

401
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:09,559
kind if we're supportive if we're friendly if we're safe for others so

402
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:16,280
many people in our society are afraid and probably the people who are saying what you said you I'm just in

403
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:23,799
just me somehow how could can I do I suspect that behind that is

404
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,480
fear and or are some others kind of feel of feeling somehow

405
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:36,240
unworthy everyone is worthy

406
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,359
so I wish you well and uh I have the idea that um we

407
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:48,559
don't know what's going to happen this week of course but uh hopefully it's all smooth

408
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:57,040
and harmonious and everyone realizes everyone realizes in the last minute what how good it is to cooperate and and

409
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:03,599
support each other and we'll live happily ever after uh but I also have some thought

410
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:10,240
that if if there's enough um challenges uh going on that maybe we

411
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:18,079
should have some kind of meeting maybe be available for some discussion or some context or it all and

412
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:25,640
so maybe it can be maybe a Wednesday evening if some may be some kind of Zoom meeting that maybe if it's necessary or

413
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:31,160
something I don't know what what's going to happen and um so I don't know I guess

414
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:36,400
the only place to really announce that is on uh what's new on the website if

415
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:42,599
you know in short notice like that the Google Calendar if we put it there it sometimes takes Google many hours to

416
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:50,599
update to make it public what we put on the calendar so just look at what's new and we'll see what makes sense and um

417
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:56,000
I'm teaching a retreat next week so for the next week I'll be thinking about the

418
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:04,640
retreatant know how do how do we care for them um but um anyway so so that um if

419
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:12,119
you're interest in such a things if it looks like we have the need for something um look at what's

420
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:19,599
new so thank you very much and may you all

421
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:26,559
be civically responsible in these 10 ways
