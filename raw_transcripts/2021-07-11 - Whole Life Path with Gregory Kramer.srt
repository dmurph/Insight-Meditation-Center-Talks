5
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,640

worldwide in 1980 his primary focus since 1995 has been

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,320
developing and sharing a relational study of the dharma and insight dialogue an interpersonal

12
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,560

16
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,840
and this wider audience is actually joining some of us here at imc in the middle of a two-day retreat on the topic of the

17
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:09,840
whole life path so welcome everyone and i'll turn it over to gregory

18
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,560
thank you

19
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,040
yeah we've been exploring a whole life path now a day and a half

20
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,760
in a retreat embedded in our lives

21
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:37,840
and for the retreat but also for this one talk this one session

22
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:46,800
if we can gain a sense of each moment

23
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,720
being infused with a sense of path

24
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,400
just that one piece i think we're doing really well

25
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,440
and the particulars like eight path factors and all this kind of thing

26
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:15,680
are really ways of populating that of supporting that that perspective that brings about

27
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,319
experience and so we'll begin by reflecting on

28
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:33,440
why i have a path at all because that gives us a sense of direction sense of purpose of the path

29
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:40,959
and the way to gain some you know

30
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:49,680
experiential sense of the dilemma that the buddha was confronting

31
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:57,439
is to perhaps attune right now to how the path is manifesting to how

32
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,799
the human experience is manifesting so

33
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,720
as you see me let's say on the screen or as i see you

34
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:16,239
the actual practice or process i mean of light touching the eye

35
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:23,120
and there's you know awareness of seeing this experience of contact

36
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,840
and in this moment of contact moment by moment by moment

37
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,160
there's a uh through the the seeing door the contact with hearing you and i

38
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,759
are sort of instantly involved in these processes of feeling and perception

39
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,880
so you not only see colors but you

40
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,680
have the form that is saying ah it's a person and particulars perhaps

41
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,360
it's oh my god it's another old white man teaching dhamma might be your perception

42
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:13,199
but it also might be like oh a human being you know like ah and so as soon as that happens

43
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:20,320
the instant the body mind recognizes that this is a human being

44
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:30,000
all of these other sensitivities come forward in that very moment

45
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,360
our entire process of human evolution as a social species pops up brain

46
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:46,800
structures are activated that are relational hormonal systems built

47
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,199
to foster relatedness are activated both in terms of stress and in terms of

48
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,800
pleasure so all of that's happening right now in this moment of

49
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:07,840
interpersonal contact you just see me and that's happening

50
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,520
and likewise when we perceive

51
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,960
anything in the world there's this exquisite sensitivity

52
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:29,199
to physical touch as we said to seeing to hearing so as you hear my voice for

53
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:36,400
example right now automatically your entire body mind is

54
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,759
assessing you know who is this person or is this

55
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,280
worth listening to you're coming to know me through the

56
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,479
quality of my voice through the things i'm saying

57
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,400
perhaps there's a sense of safety or unsafety

58
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,360
credibility or not

59
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,240
and like all of the learning that you've done moment by moment throughout your life is

60
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,000
operating right now to get oriented in the world

61
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,440
to assess the world in this case me speaking

62
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,160
so this is uh just one piece of this exquisite

63
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,360
sensitivity of the entire organism

64
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,319
so here you are you've perhaps sitting in your body

65
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,800
feeling perhaps the form of the body the shape of the body

66
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:56,080
and all of those nerve endings that tell you ah here's a map

67
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,560
of this form this rupa bodily form

68
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:11,360
that sensitivity begins to take uh you know the construct of i me

69
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:18,639
my body but also just like the construct of taking in the light and the touching and

70
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:26,960
then the perception and then there's gregory and then there's a person and he's out there i'm in here

71
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:34,800
so that whole sense of me you and meanwhile all the air

72
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:42,800
touches the skin just like the sounds touch the ear molecules touch the nose molecules touch

73
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:54,160
the tongue when you eat something so all of these sensitivities to the world are constantly operating

74
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,920
pleasant unpleasant interpersonally pleasant and unpleasant

75
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,760
socially in the bigger framework a thought comes up of our society or of

76
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,519
our sangha some is pleasant like our sangha some might not be like our politics

77
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:20,959
so we're constantly responding to that just like we're responding to light

78
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:27,839
and air pressure waves that touch the ears it's quite something how sensitive we

79
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:34,480
are i mean right now just the slightest wiggle

80
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,320
of my vocal cords with air coming through gets picked up by a microphone the

81
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,680
microphone diaphragm vibrates it gets sent over the internet as a

82
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:54,560
digitized signal comes out of your monitor your speakers your speakers vibrate the air the air

83
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,360
pressure differences touch the ears the nerves you know the auditory nerve

84
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,200
sends this signal to the brain so every vibration of my throat

85
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,959
moves through that channel to wiggle your ears

86
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,880
and so my throat and your ears your tympanic membrane are coupled

87
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,920
right now so sensitive it's so intimate

88
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:31,200
but we take it for granted and not only are we in contact through

89
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:38,640
language through sound but through the meanings so what is in my mind is reaching your

90
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,000
mind through this language not everything in my mind

91
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,920
aren't you lucky but actually you know a dhamma contact so now

92
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:59,839
not only is there visual contact auditory contact there's mind contact through language

93
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,880
right now as i'm speaking this that right this is this is our

94
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,560
sensitivity operating

95
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,800
and right now in this moment

96
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,760
it's operating in service of conveying dhamma

97
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,800
a sense of sensing sensation sensitivity touch contact passage the poly word for

98
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,160
contact and the veda now that comes the pleasant and the unpleasant the sauna the

99
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,680
perception of things and qualities so i'm conveying dhamma

100
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:51,040
from this mind to you you hear these words you understand so there's contact and through that

101
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,079
contact that channel of contact dhamma is flowing right now

102
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:02,720
right you see what i'm saying okay so

103
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,720
that relational that relationship we have of spiritual friendship

104
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,760
is established in service of seeing things as they actually are

105
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:23,040
that's what we're doing right now so this is a path factor practice of right

106
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:31,279
view the voice of another right now is me and wise attention he only saw monastic

107
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:38,079
that's connection between one person and another the buddha said the voice of another and

108
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,279
wise attention are the necessary conditions for the

109
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,639
arising of right view necessary

110
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,680
wow unless you're a self

111
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,120
buddha right this is what he's talking about

112
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,639
so we can begin to get a sense right here right now

113
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,680
of the path functioning a wholesome path

114
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:19,680
and the path factor that's i'm just naming is right view we're practicing it through discussion

115
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:27,600
and buddha also named that we could practice it through study as

116
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:35,600
a path factor practice of right view also through tranquility

117
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,480
conditions right view because when the mind is calm you can see what you can't see otherwise

118
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:49,600
insight obviously a practice of right view we are we usually think of the methods

119
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,639
of mindfulness and concentration but the actual uh

120
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,160
you might say uh in service of you know the mindfulness and the samadhi

121
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,600
in service of right view so this is practicing right view as is

122
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:17,839
sitting in vipassana and seeing things as they are

123
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,480
so

124
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,079
path is operating and we're just seeing one of the ways it's operating

125
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,920
now why does that matter

126
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,680
the whole purpose of the path has to be understood and it's understood in the context right

127
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,360
now i'm suggesting of this human sensitivity

128
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,440
to the world to all these contacts to so much going on and the complexity that the mind builds

129
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,959
up out of all these contexts my preferences

130
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:05,839
and the things i dislike and that scare me i build those build up

131
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:15,680
all the things that are familiar and unfamiliar i begin to develop a sense of

132
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,639
uh the ways that i create safety in this complex

133
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:29,600
world that i don't control is by exerting control where i can get it because i'm

134
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,040
so sensitive i'm so you know i need to survive

135
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,519
i need to get safe and i want pleasure and i want to avoid pain so the organism

136
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,800
is functioning with all these imperatives this is what i this is what the nature

137
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:54,079
of my life is is getting the pleasures avoiding the pains and stabilizing the self

138
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,759
because that's survival

139
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:08,160
so how do we survive how do i stabilize

140
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:16,000
this sensitive being in a world that is out of my control and that

141
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,360
effort and all the strategies

142
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,519
begin to form the basis of the tension that we call

143
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:36,800
self and the strategies that we call personality or behavior patterns this is

144
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,160
like how i get through the world making it work

145
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,079
so perhaps i learned for example to perform in some way by being

146
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:55,040
particularly beautiful or particularly smart or to get seen and to exist and to

147
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:05,839
stabilize a sense of me and get the supplies to keep that me well guarded well well regarded

148
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,038
and so i you know i could have a beautiful voice so i could make beautiful drawings

149
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:20,880
or i could just scream a lot so that people will pay attention to me so that's like

150
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:29,120
that's see me so i can exist and i pleasure myself so i feel like i

151
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:37,520
exist and i enjoy those pleasures and i can surround myself wrap myself in pleasant stimulations

152
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,720
and temporarily keep out the unpleasant ones that just keep

153
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,160
coming back in whether it's something as simple as this

154
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:55,520
sensitive body getting hurt by things like poked and stuck and in the suit as you

155
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,559
see you know insect bites and the beating of the sun and you know very

156
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,640
direct kind of you know very earthy sense of the human

157
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,880
experiences conveyed in the discourses the body growing old is described with

158
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,880
its you know its gray and thinning hair and its missing teeth and its bent over

159
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,679
form these are the aspects of dukkha that that kind of the world

160
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:32,000
constantly out of my control pressing in and i'm trying to wow i'm trying to make

161
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,360
i'm trying to stabilize and make it work within that

162
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:44,160
and so the pleasures i can paste them over myself

163
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:54,400
and still the world keeps happening

164
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:01,759
i can't keep the flow of pleasure high enough to make it work

165
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,400
so this human dilemma continues as the world presses in and i

166
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:16,880
when it's too much i want to get out rather than exist and be seen and you know and uh kind of become

167
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,559
in the world i now want to get out of the world also at the same time because it's too much

168
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:28,799
because i'm so sensitive sensitive to other people sensitive to

169
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:36,240
the touches on the eye the touches on the ear the touches on the skin and the touches of my mind

170
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,520
beating on me what's next what do i do how do i do it

171
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,200
who am i am i safe who am i relationship with i

172
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,400
feel lonely i feel overwhelmed

173
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,559
so all these

174
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:05,520
qualities of the human dilemma call it dukkha first noble truth right

175
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,919
this kind of underlying challenge

176
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:20,640
because of our sensitivity and this is the context of our path this is what we're living

177
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,159
with suffering in the end of suffering

178
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:34,320
addresses both the most subtle anxiety and how we meet the world

179
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,799
all the way through the totality of aging illness and death

180
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,440
so the urgency

181
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,159
of getting and having the urgency of wanting

182
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,640
of loneliness and so on

183
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:08,720
so as we practice right view right now

184
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,280
coming to see this nature of the human experience we say wait a minute i could be doing

185
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,600
this anytime i'm observing my life in a reflective way

186
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:28,880
and one way to sort of keep your bearings is when the dhamma is a reference point

187
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:35,840
and we say okay how can i bring the practice of right view

188
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,960
into my everyday life i'm not going to run around just looking at a dhamma book and i can't always have

189
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,320
dharma discussions i can't always be in meditation

190
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,919
i can always be practicing morality which is also practice of right view

191
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:03,440
so can i begin to invoke the dhamma

192
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:10,320
as a frame of reference just in my life and most of us have done some of this of

193
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:17,120
course with let's say a reflection just take it through your life on impermanence

194
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:24,000
and this can be the very accessible stuff like noticing the impermanence of the

195
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,039
world which is really the impermanence of the sensing of the world

196
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:34,080
so okay wow yeah the wind is blowing or this tree is rotting or

197
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:41,840
cars are drifting by or sounds never stop changing

198
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,159
reflection on dukkha

199
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:54,880
where's you know where is the kind of the stress and the fear and the separation operating how is the mind constantly

200
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,240
wanting not expecting it to stop but we're just talking about right view

201
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,000
just now simple simple simple practice don't try to try to transcend it don't

202
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:16,240
try to anything just it's a practice of right view to notice that continuity of noticing

203
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:23,840
so what you're mindful of is this aspect of experience

204
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:31,760
so it's practice of right view and all of a sudden wait a minute that's also a practice of right mindfulness

205
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:39,360
we begin to see ah i can observe the mind in its frantic ways it's

206
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,880
difficult ways it's sometimes unkind ways

207
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,679
and if i'm observing and not falling into fusion with it that's the practice

208
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,880
of right view and right mindfulness

209
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,200
so we begin to see this sensitivity for example that's a reflection on the sense doors a

210
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,559
reflection on contact reflection on consciousness itself but it's all

211
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:19,840
in the experiential side of it is simply sensitivity so you might notice that now

212
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,600
what's it like to be contacted with the world right now

213
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,440
in the middle of a dharma talk on a sunday morning

214
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,120
the touch of the world

215
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,559
you can notice also the touch of the mind world

216
00:24:48,559 --> 00:25:00,720
as thoughts continue to self-fabricate

217
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:08,000
sensitivity to the image to the sound and the whole feeling tone

218
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,360
that's been conditioned by this talking that's been going on

219
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:20,880
from this guy this moment conditioned by that

220
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:36,159
so putting the sensitivity to work in service of understanding

221
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:42,480
some aditi of right view and right

222
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:56,880
mindfulness is what's knowing this yeah practicing right mindfulness right now

223
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,919
so there's another path factor that's operating that we just haven't named and i'm going to name it now

224
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,360
you might notice that as you're listening and you go let's say perhaps try the things that

225
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,640
i'm suggesting you look at the mind you aim the mind this way you're paying

226
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:21,679
attention perhaps to what i'm saying let's look at the energy that

227
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:28,960
comes in to pay attention like oh as the buddha said lending ear

228
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,679
you're lending ear right now notice the stepping up the energizing of the body

229
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,960
mind to hear these words to pay attention to them

230
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,240
to notice the qualities in the pause

231
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:57,120
noticing that energy that's an aspect of right effort

232
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,360
you're applying yourself you're offering your attention

233
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,840
you're showing up right effort

234
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:18,480
so right now already as we sit here simple listening to this talk being

235
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,760
together in this already the path factors of right

236
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:30,640
view are operating being being developed

237
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:38,320
right effort is operating and being developed as we like wow i'm really you know i'm i'm here and right

238
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,320
mindfulness attending to the path noticing your own body mind functioning

239
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,840
all of those path factors right now

240
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,398
are unfolding and developing not just

241
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:10,000
flat any time that you're in your life

242
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,279
and there's sufficient uh motivation

243
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:26,000
to look for the path in this way you can find it that's good to know

244
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,480
it's never distant that's really good to know

245
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,720
but we are greatly supported if we learn

246
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,080
what that feels like we learn it rationally like i'm offering all these words to

247
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,200
support it and how it feels in the body to just sort of say ah

248
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:58,000
what's it like to be on the path it's like this you get a sense

249
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,279
of right view right effort operating right mindfulness operating it's like a

250
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,799
whole embodied experience this relational experience that we're in

251
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:14,320
right now spiritual friendship the voice of another wise attention being together as

252
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:23,279
a sangha has a certain feel and a sangha is a collective experience aimed

253
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:30,480
towards understanding suffering in the end of suffering this is it this is our sangha experience

254
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,600
path it's the path aspect

255
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,360
whole life path so let's attune now to this sense of

256
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,360
shared direction that we have aiming of the mind together

257
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:56,480
okay so we're understanding this human dilemma of sensitivity

258
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,279
and all the urges that push this sensitive being towards pleasure

259
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:11,440
away from pain towards becoming away from becoming we kind of were sensing that and saying ah

260
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,559
it doesn't have to be like that there's some notion in here that together ah it doesn't have to be

261
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:26,240
so fraught we don't have to be trapped in this there's some we can wake up there's a

262
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:37,840
sense of that and here we are together in that in intention that aim of the heart

263
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:45,600
sensing that direction that feeling the kind of the feeling tone of the

264
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,840
direction of our lives the direction of this very moment

265
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,640
can you look into your own mind into your own heart right now

266
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:07,600
and feel this kind of maybe a percolating sense of purpose

267
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:19,840
sense of possibility

268
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:27,760
as we grow that sense of possibility as we explore it together

269
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,519
as we surround ourselves with things that remind us of this possibility

270
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:39,519
we're practicing right in tension we're cultivating wholesome intentions

271
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:47,120
or the aiming the direction of the heart so right now

272
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:53,919
these words that we're sharing this sense of being in the dhamma together that we're

273
00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:00,000
sharing is aimed

274
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,360
right intention right here now with these very words so you see the

275
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,360
connection between right view and right intention when we see things a certain way like constantly

276
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,279
trying to fill that empty hole in in my senses in my heart

277
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,360
is never gonna work oh so there's another way this kind of way

278
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,640
of letting go a way of love and compassion that is not just a

279
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:43,279
built around trying to protect and satisfy a me that's never gonna work it's painful it

280
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:49,760
will always be painful except for those little moments of success that then pass and there you

281
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,200
are again bereft and

282
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:02,080
something else is possible in this letting go and the opening and care that happens

283
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,760
when we let go oh that's also possible and you feel

284
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,518
that and what happens when you see that clearly

285
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:20,799
you aim that way right you say that's what i want that's where i'm gonna go the the the

286
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:29,679
animal body wants that even the animal body doesn't just want pleasure the animal body wants stability

287
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,960
and all those mental constructs

288
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:42,240
of me and how i get my satisfactions and how i protect myself

289
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,279
oh that's never gonna be satisfied that's never gonna stabilize

290
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:53,279
but if i enter into a care for others

291
00:33:53,279 --> 00:34:00,960
as a natural consequence of coming out of this shell of self

292
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,640
that's something this that this body mind can say oh yeah

293
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:13,919
that move is the connection between right view and right intention the aiming of

294
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:20,720
the mind that comes when we understand that sama-san kappa

295
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:27,919
so those classical right intentions of renunciation or relinquishment and

296
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:36,158
of loving kindness or non-anger non-hatred and of non-cruelty non-harming

297
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,760
or compassion so onset put in the positive sense that renunciation

298
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,638
love and compassion those are the classical wholesome intentions

299
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,480
as opposed to the unwholesome ones of course of sensual accumulation and gathering and

300
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:01,119
trying to get right and then when you can't get what you want or

301
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:09,680
someone's in the way or things don't work out there's anger there's hatred that intention and the downright cruelty

302
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,880
that the human organism is also capable of

303
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,760
right wow just saying it hurts to think about doesn't it so but

304
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:28,720
then the turning of the mind saying this is a way to go that can

305
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:34,640
actually bring happiness rather than this frantic deluded thing that's you know i can get happiness

306
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,839
out of you know somehow somehow these anger of mine is going to

307
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:45,760
make me happy or this cruelty or this insatiable

308
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:53,839
sensory gluttony will somehow

309
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:00,800
bring happiness kind of from the outside it looks a little absurd but this practice the

310
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:08,320
bright view that we're doing and right effort paying attention

311
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:15,680
bringing ourselves together even showing up here today right view right effort and right

312
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,720
mindfulness because we're monitoring experience and saying ah this is what the body mind is doing

313
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,520
we're holding the dhamma in mind that's also right mindfulness and this is aiming the mind

314
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,920
in a wholesome way so this is right intention

315
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,320
and in the whole of our lives

316
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:51,440
we're embedded in this process in this

317
00:36:52,839 --> 00:37:00,000
um uh very tangled complex world

318
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,839
we're not doing this like some out in outer space in some vacuum in a little

319
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:15,599
bubble it's here and now in this world like this with this body

320
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,560
with your relationships and in this culture that's just how it

321
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:29,839
is you can't get out of it you have no choice we have no choice

322
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:37,599
this is how it is

323
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:45,200
so there's some hard work there but there's also some really good news

324
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,839
i'm gonna name a little of the hard work first if you don't mind

325
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:01,760
that being embedded in our relationships

326
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:07,440
means that these are the conditions these relations

327
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:16,240
form the conditions for my path the unfolding of my path

328
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,838
and no matter how much work i do on the cushion

329
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:28,400
if i am functioning in a way that is harmful

330
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,880
cruel shut down greedy

331
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:45,119
that the body mind will continue to suffer and insight will continue to

332
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:51,680
mostly uh evade me

333
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,839
and if we shut down likewise

334
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:09,920
from the pressing suffering not only of our immediate relations but

335
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,960
now opening out into our cultural relations to our society

336
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,480
then what that is it's a form of a vija ignorance where there's all this

337
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,880
suffering that i've shut off from the mind as much as i can because it feels like

338
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,000
too much so i've chosen to maybe unconsciously

339
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,640
chosen to shrink

340
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:48,400
and the unaware of injustice economic injustice racial

341
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:56,000
injustice gender injustice and so on i've decided somehow in my heart

342
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,720
maybe consciously maybe not climate change is just too much hyper consumption is just too

343
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,079
much the insanity of our media life is just

344
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:16,000
too much and you say i can't you know i can't i'm not going to pay attention to that

345
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,720
and so there's this vast world that we've now shut off and when

346
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:34,160
we go to open to the world we really only open to the bare edges of our bubble

347
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:44,160
and the tensions that surround us are continue to press in on the heart

348
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:50,640
so this is difficult news because we often carry a sense of going

349
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:58,000
off to the meditation hall as uh

350
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,119
an escape from that rather than as an awakening that allows

351
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:11,280
us to be with that in an awakened and equanimous

352
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:19,280
way it's a very different thing one is which is to say

353
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:27,119
get me out it's the bypass of the world through spiritual practice

354
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,400
and it's the bypass of relationships and relationships are complicated

355
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,240
so whether it's the relationships with society or with my significant others my family

356
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,279
of origin hey this is complex stuff

357
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:50,640
how could that possibly be part of the path we say but i'm going to ask you another

358
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:59,359
question how could your primary relations not be part of the path

359
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:05,440
if every moment conditions the next

360
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:11,359
how could those relations not be part of the path

361
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,560
so let's pause for a moment and sit with that

362
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,040
okay so every

363
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,480
moment of the constructing processes of the mind

364
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:41,680
conditions consciousness moment by moment so we pause right now

365
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,319
sensing into the rising and vanishing of experience

366
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,119
and this very moment is conditioned by all that came before

367
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,880
so it's conditioned right now most obviously by this dharma talk i'm offering

368
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,960
you could sense into how that feels

369
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:18,400
this moment is conditioned by something as simple as what you ate

370
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:27,839
for breakfast or how well you slept let's pause for a moment and see that

371
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:38,000
this moment moment by moment is conditioned by all your prior

372
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:47,359
relational contacts every one of them so perhaps you can sense

373
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:54,960
the presence in some sense the conditioning impact is what i mean of your mother

374
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:02,160
your father and his siblings just sense how they condition the sense

375
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:09,839
of you sitting here right now in your dharma chair right now

376
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:30,880
the poly for all of this is independent origination sankara pachaya vignana so

377
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,640
all prior formations volitional formations all these contacts

378
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,400
condition the arising of consciousness moment by moment

379
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,880
so the whole experience of body mind right now

380
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,799
being known by consciousness

381
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:05,838
and conditioned

382
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,440
and this is constantly being formed and reformed with every contact with the world

383
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:24,079
every volitional contact with the world so how could your relations possibly not

384
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:32,240
be intrinsic to the dharma path of freedom

385
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,119
it's not possible

386
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,920
so here we are now arriving at the path factor of right speech

387
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:58,960
wow what a powerful thing huh i mean we're using speech now skillfully

388
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:05,440
at least i hope so it's a vehicle for dhamma

389
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,760
but what about you know speech as a vehicle for loving kindness for care

390
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:19,520
how are you today sweetheart what did you do today i care and something in the body mind

391
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,000
lets go it's like oh yeah

392
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:31,520
can i help you with that yeah i know how you feel

393
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,599
this is speech conveying something of the heart

394
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:45,520
and i don't want to press it too hard but wrong speech or harmful speech

395
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:52,000
lying to someone is like a rip in the fabric of the universe

396
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:02,000
how can you live the buddha went so far as to say one who would utter untrue

397
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,839
speech there is no evil that they may not do it was like the

398
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:14,079
fundamental thing so here we are understanding

399
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,599
the practice of right speech in terms of human sensitivity

400
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:26,800
and the power of that path factor of right speech what you listen to what you take in how

401
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:34,000
you speak and what you express do you think right speech doesn't include your emails

402
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:42,079
does it include the photographs you publish it's not verbal language it's a

403
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:48,640
imagistic language so it's all of the art we make all of

404
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:54,480
the expressions we have through our blogs or our podcasts or

405
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,880
whatever

406
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:11,119
and write action now when we sense right action as all action

407
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:18,839
we have sort of the core of a body the power of a body to do

408
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:26,800
harm action right action so wrong action

409
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,240
of killing you know wow just to really think about

410
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:37,599
intentionally harming other people and you get a sense in this conversation we're having now

411
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:46,640
wow how does that condition the mind going forward and we see on my path of non-harm

412
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:53,839
disenters from myself and creates safety for others and when i

413
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:59,520
participate in creating an a universe

414
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:05,359
that is safer for other beings that good will conditions my mind as well as

415
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:11,119
conditions my immediate relationships and it extends and infuses out to the

416
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:20,160
world so i can participate in making the world safe for others

417
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:26,240
so that might look like you know political action it might look

418
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:34,079
like a simple gesture of holding a door open for someone each of us finds our balance in the

419
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:39,280
active aspect not just the refraining aspect of right action but the active

420
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,720
part of it of creating safety

421
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,920
and care and extending that

422
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:59,200
as the buddha said you know caring for oneself

423
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:05,359
is good caring for others is good and the

424
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:10,880
highest and the best is caring for both self and other

425
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:18,880
unambiguous that's the path he's describing a path

426
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:27,839
suffering in the end of suffering internal external and both

427
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:40,960
so how we engage

428
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:48,160
with harming and stealing and sexuality and so on is this relational

429
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:55,839
uh manifesting of the path

430
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:06,000
forming the mind forming relationships and forming writ large our culture

431
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:15,920
actively participating in that as dhammapath nothing left out nothing is left out

432
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:26,559
so let's just pause for a moment and sense into each each of us take a moment internally

433
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,200
and sense into the direction of your life

434
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,839
in speech and action and livelihood

435
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:45,680
how you handle money how you spend it how you earn it

436
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:53,838
how does this manifest the path at all times

437
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,599
so mindfulness is operating right now

438
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:19,119
right effort right intention developing right

439
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:26,318
intention aiming the mind towards the relinquishment and the compassion

440
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:38,559
to understand the power of right speech right action and right livelihood

441
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,960
a sense of the whole life nothing left

442
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:47,839
out

443
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:07,920
and the nature of the mind the body mind to become tangled

444
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:14,960
is great neural patterns form hormonal

445
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:23,440
habits form and these tangles we act

446
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:31,440
from these tangles we see the world through these tangles that go very deep

447
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:38,800
so there's compassion and there's patience and there's the deep work of right

448
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:45,040
effort and right mindfulness says were you seeing now

449
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:50,960
but also right mindfulness and right effort in formal practice like inside dialogue

450
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,000
like vipassana

451
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,839
so let's look at the role of sama samadhi in exactly this framework that we've

452
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:08,160
provided here this sense of being intoxicated with the

453
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:16,000
self being being lost in ignorance and tangled and not

454
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:24,880
and understand that samadhi's unique power

455
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:31,359
when the body-mind settles and gathers calms down

456
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,240
and gathers

457
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:43,119
to see things as they actually are which is to say

458
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:51,040
the nature of the tangle and perhaps to touch the experience of

459
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:56,960
being of untangling of a letting go

460
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:02,400
of the knots of the gathered self of the gathered

461
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,680
personality of the crunch of i am

462
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:13,119
and all the fears and the aggression that comes out of fear and all of that

463
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:19,119
getting down underneath to where it's all formed like right down at the bottom to

464
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:24,799
where it turns into from just the flux

465
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:32,799
of experiencing body mind and it becomes like wow now it's a me

466
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:42,160
that has to do all these nasty things but there's a relaxing of all that

467
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:49,839
beneath and it's all just flux the samadhi the sama samadhi comes not

468
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:55,839
only through our lifestyle that is changing towards

469
00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:01,280
morality and tranquility and decency and sanity but also towards

470
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:07,359
formal practice so we have a place on the path

471
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:15,200
for formal practices where we can experience things in a way

472
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:23,200
that the normal conditioned habit mind does not cannot it's too

473
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:29,440
noisy it can't hear the signal because there's so much noise in the air

474
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:36,000
so we lower the signal to no we lower the we increase the signal to noise ratio we

475
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:44,799
lower the noise we increase the signal of things as they are simplicity

476
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:52,480
impermanence the qualities

477
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:59,839
of the flux rather than the self experiencing rather than the grabbing of

478
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:04,960
experience experiencing as process and samadhi can

479
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:12,559
bear this samadhi can witness this there's sufficient equanimity sufficient

480
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:19,040
stillness and that insight those

481
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:25,760
insights that come with sati and samadhi in formal practice then can infuse

482
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:32,640
the totality of our lives and we say oh now i have a new benchmark

483
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:41,040
for what's possible in the way of for example calm

484
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:46,799
i used to think i was calm sunday morning drinking coffee reading the paper

485
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:54,640
i now have a new understanding of passati of tranquility at

486
00:57:54,640 --> 00:58:03,280
that i didn't have before so i can see the tension more clearly i also now have a new understanding of

487
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,720
you know all of my the manifesting of my personal strategies

488
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:15,040
to get by and to get what i want and all this kind of stuff you know it's pretty tense now i see

489
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:23,200
that and i'm still doing it because it's a habit i've got and i'm working on it but i now see myself doing it

490
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:29,040
it's like oh oh ouch it kind of hurts a little bit we begin to see the pain where we thought there was

491
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:34,079
pleasure it's quite something so

492
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:40,480
we see the role i mean there's many more things we could say but we see the role of formal practice just as we see

493
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:45,680
in inside dialogue the way we keep others at a distance or we hunger for

494
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:53,839
others and there's a releasing and letting go of that insight comes

495
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,960
so to sum up

496
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:09,280
the whole of the path includes every moment of our lives it absolutely

497
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:16,720
you know it's just like patently how it is that nothing is left out of forming and reforming our

498
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:22,960
minds each moment so the actions of our body and our

499
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:28,160
speech you know everything's conditioning the next moment so path is always on

500
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:34,880
let's do it skillfully that's the message let's do it well rather than haphazard

501
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:42,160
like whatever you know i mean our moms and our dads and our teachers and stuff they taught us

502
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:50,400
what they could but let's keep learning you know and there's a place for formal practice

503
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:57,839
on the totality of the path and let's honor that and let's see the whole of the path and

504
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:06,400
you know in all that we do and the more we learn what the path factors are the options

505
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:14,559
how they can be manifest and grow that's the that learning process

506
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:19,599
then shows us at any moment that we choose

507
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:27,200
that there are options the path is always operating we now have the skill to see how

508
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:35,599
that's it so it's just about time to end

509
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:42,319
um i'm going to say that for those of you who don't know latest

510
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:47,359
book is called entitled the whole life path a lay person's

511
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:52,960
a lay buddhist guide to a dhamma-infused life and it really goes into all these path

512
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:58,799
factors and the reason i can so shamelessly to tell you about that book now

513
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:05,599
is because it's all of them whatever money comes in goes to the inside dialogue community there's no personal

514
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:12,078
gain here i want you to know that that it's really offered in service

515
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:17,599
and i hope that that's helpful for you

516
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:24,960
and uh i'll close by

517
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:31,280
sharing that um the observation that the great privilege we have of

518
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:37,520
meeting we with each other of having the technology of having the safety

519
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:44,480
to pay attention and not have to run away from marauders and bullets and that we have

520
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:51,680
enough to eat so we can take this time because we don't have to run out right away and find our next meal

521
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:58,960
those are all amazing conditions for practice and there are many who do not share

522
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:04,839
those conditions so we let ourselves be touched by that

523
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:11,520
actuality that there is a lot of suffering in this world

524
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,880
and that our practice is on behalf of these beings as well

525
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:25,119
so may all beings without exception share in the merits of our practice together

526
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:29,280
may all beings be free

527
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:38,160
may there be peace may there be peace

528
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:45,599
may there be peace
