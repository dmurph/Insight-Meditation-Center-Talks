1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:07,520
and today um i will share the uh the suta that i've been uh

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,200
speaking about for this week uh maybe towards the end uh so we don't

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,000
all have to get occupied by reading the sutes but i will be sharing a link

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,640
at the end

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,560
so maybe just take a few moments to settle in

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,879
we'll begin with the arriving sequence again

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,920
if you like you can close your eyes

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,718
gently softly

9
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,399
arriving

10
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,360
as if you're arriving in a quiet meditation hall

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,680
bring some gentle kindness softness

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,560
and quiet as you settle in

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,000
taking seat

14
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,560
really taking your seat

15
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,079
feel the contact of your body with the chair or the floor

16
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,520
know that you're sitting

17
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,640
arriving here on your seat

18
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,400
leaving the contact of your feet on the ground

19
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,720
supported by earth

20
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,959
maybe there is a sense of the whole body landing

21
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,480
landing here and now

22
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:07,599
maybe a few long deep breaths to allow yourself to settle in

23
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:23,519
becoming available however so slightly

24
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:31,159
to the lived experience right here and now

25
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,319
sound movements of the breath

26
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,040
contacts of the body

27
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,799
being available evokes a sense of opening up

28
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,599
the awareness to receive

29
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,759
not wanting anything to happen

30
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,240
not driven by our preferences our wishes

31
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,600
just open open up

32
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:45,560
surrender to whatever shows up

33
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,720
allowing ourselves physically from ground up

34
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,479
sitting like a redwood

35
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:30,919
align our heart to mind along with the uplifting body

36
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,800
align with aspirations

37
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,880
align with a good will

38
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,120
align with non-harming

39
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,560
for me i feel a sense of the ease at ease

40
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,720
when there is that inner alignment with integrity

41
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,039
value and goodness in our heart and mind

42
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:08,400
softly and gently open to the felt sense of the earth

43
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:22,918
element the contact of a bones with the earth

44
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,440
firmness dance

45
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,720
settling downwards

46
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:22,759
resting in the valve sense of earth element in this earthy body

47
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:44,640
maybe the sense of assessability may come in a strand

48
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,279
like the big pillar

49
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,320
holding a structure of this body

50
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:37,240
feel the quietness of the bones

51
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:46,680
stillness however so slightly

52
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:21,680
the earth element in the backdrop of our awareness

53
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,399
becoming available to the felt sense of air element

54
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,440
winged moving through our bodies

55
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,279
so rising and falling up the belly as you breathe

56
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,600
expansion and contraction of the torso

57
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,760
different kinds of vibrations and buzzing in the body

58
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,639
dropping out of my ideas beliefs

59
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,839
feel and sense into

60
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,240
the elements

61
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,160
alive

62
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,120
flush each moment flush

63
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:49,279
i'm here we open and expand our field of

64
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:55,680
awareness to receive space

65
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,800
space that holds the earth element this body

66
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:16,360
space inside of the body and outside around us

67
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,720
gentle opening and expanding

68
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,800
to receive space

69
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:59,240
space all around where the sound travels

70
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,279
be a felt sense of a spaciousness in your being

71
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,959
however am i show up

72
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,320
for me there is a slight opening of the torso

73
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,880
slide opening of my shoulder blades

74
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,360
being available to space

75
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,920
there are different qualities of the felt sense of space

76
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,079
likeness

77
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,440
openness

78
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,160
and sometimes there may be slight brightness to it

79
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,000
or darkness

80
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,880
however it shows up for you

81
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:29,959
different elements are held in space

82
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:59,320
relax and ease into the space

83
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:45,039
there may be a different kind of a stillness related to space

84
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,840
a delicate kind of a space stillness

85
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,960
quiet

86
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:16,679
as if you can hear the sound of a silence

87
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,080
experiences can arise and pass

88
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,280
in this vast spacious field

89
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,400
and the space is unmoving unmoved

90
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:38,320
for the rest of her meditation you're welcome to stay

91
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,240
with space or receive

92
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,840
any other experiences that may seem prominent for you

93
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,400
releasing concepts ideas

94
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,480
match yourself melt away into the space

95
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:36,880
the buddha said to his son rahula rahula

96
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:44,080
meditated like a space when you meditate like a space

97
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:51,640
pleasant unpleasant contact will not occupy your mind

98
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:15,720
space doesn't tremble by the things that happen within it

99
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,520
the vast spaciousness

100
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:47,919
all experiences are free to be themselves

101
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:57,760
emotions thoughts sensations in the body

102
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,720
free to flow in the vast field of

103
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,720
spaciousness

104
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,840
if there is any form of well-being

105
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,039
oh some goodness that are bubbling up

106
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:04,600
allow them to permeate in the vastness

107
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,720
let your whole body and mind and heart be nourished

108
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,480
by the sense of a well-being

109
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:31,080
however much there is available to you

110
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:39,349
you [Music]

111
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:46,109
[Music]

112
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,960
[Music]

113
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:26,000
welcome everyone feel quite sacred

114
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,919
to be in the space with you all the vast space holding out of us

115
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,960
meditating together

116
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,360
allow that goodness to touch you

117
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,720
and maybe support you on the path

118
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,320
so today we're going to continue our conversation

119
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,159
on sila and then we'll speak a little bit about

120
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,600
the last precept and then maybe do a

121
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:20,080
review on the whole territory of vasila

122
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,679
so this last precept many of you would know this

123
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:34,640
it's about undertaking the training rules of abstaining from intoxicants

124
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:43,440
drugs and alcohol that leads to heatlessness or cloudiness of our minds

125
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:56,880
well we all know that the danger of cloudy minds

126
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:03,519
right when our mind is not clear

127
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:10,960
and acting out from that kind of a cloudyness

128
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:18,878
dawnness we know we know what it feels like we know

129
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:25,440
what may happen so there is a real danger of that

130
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:32,000
and so this precept is inviting us to become really um clear

131
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,040
about this and say oh you know i'm not going to

132
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:43,679
play with the fire here this is like um i keep on using the

133
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,000
young children kids as examples i have my background my son is playing guitar you

134
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,560
might even have heard this um in our meditation

135
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:03,760
um and so it's like i'm telling young kids not to touch the hot stove

136
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:11,440
because it'll burn and if the kids really listen and then don't go anywhere close to it

137
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:18,640
they may never get burnt and over time they really know you know there is a danger and they understand

138
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,760
and so the same thing with this particular precept

139
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:28,880
it's pointing to the danger of a cloudy mind

140
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,200
and asking us well you know we've all heard so many stories

141
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,119
about what happens when one is drunk or um

142
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,720
get intoxicated i and the much harm has been done in so

143
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,599
many different ways so abstain from

144
00:35:53,599 --> 00:36:01,440
taking drugs and intoxicants that clouds our mind

145
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,040
but there is also a deeper dimension of this particular precept

146
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:17,839
which is that the precept is pointing at the care and protection of a clear and

147
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,359
pure mind and heart

148
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,839
this is where the cultivation of awareness coming right

149
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:36,960
the precept invites us to cultivate awareness to become sensitive

150
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,079
to the conditions that leads to cloudiness dullness

151
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,839
and the conditions that leads to brightness in our mind and clarity in

152
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,800
our mind and heart

153
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,240
and so that's a dimension that invites all of us to

154
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,640
begin to pay careful attention to in fact it's not just intoxicants and

155
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:11,599
drugs and alcohol that clouds our mind and we you may have noticed even some

156
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:19,760
food or certain activities that can cloud our mind and cloud our being

157
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:28,079
or the way we take our food overeating and under eating

158
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,119
it can also lead to doneness and cloudiness

159
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:39,920
of our bodies and mind and so this cultivation of mindful

160
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:46,000
awareness is to begin to tune in to kind of those forces that may happen

161
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,880
within us and begin to learn to cultivate

162
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,079
the conditions that support and alert clear

163
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:05,400
mind and let go of the conditions that leads to

164
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:12,480
heatlessness and cloudiness of our mind and some of you may have

165
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,760
seen this that even you know for

166
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,200
nowadays if people you know play i don't know hours

167
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,800
of video games when they come out of their room

168
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:36,000
you look at them you know you just kind of feel there is sort of i don't know the tiredness

169
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,119
around on the person um [Music]

170
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,640
it can kind of create a different forms of energy when we engage in

171
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:53,440
activities it really kind of um does our mind

172
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,560
i remember one time when i was attending a conference

173
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:05,440
in las vegas that was a big casino with lots of big conference rooms and

174
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,359
one early morning i um was getting into the elevator to go down

175
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:19,280
to the conference rooms and there was a person walked in with a bucket of coins

176
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:27,200
it was very clear that the person had probably played a long time overnight or knows maybe a

177
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,839
whole night and the person looked very tired

178
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:41,880
when i looked into her eyes there were no sparks

179
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,800
at that moment i felt uh wow this felt lifeless

180
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,480
and so as if this hours and maybe whole night of gambling

181
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:04,079
had taken the sparks of life out of the person

182
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,839
so begin to pay attention to our activities

183
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,760
how we engage in our activities contribute

184
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,200
becoming conditions that can lead to dullness and cloudiness

185
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:30,400
of our mind and heart and we learn to abstain from them

186
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,920
and similarly in this meditation that we just did

187
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,079
maybe you have some experience a felt sense of clarity

188
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:48,560
and felt sense of alertness aliveness

189
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:55,359
sparks of our lives and so we began to know although these

190
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:01,200
are the conditions that brings the sparkles of our lives

191
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,560
life in us

192
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,560
and so with this kind of a clarity in our heart and mind

193
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:19,520
we can cultivate the entire um sila

194
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,640
domain that we've been talking about the five precepts

195
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,680
the more we become clear and uh aware

196
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,280
the more we can allow the depth and the richness of the practice of vasila

197
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,760
to mature in us so in this way

198
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,800
while cultivating sila not as a some form of a dogmatic holding

199
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,880
of you know we shall not do so and so you know this and that

200
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:02,079
or you know i'm getting a hundred out of a sela test

201
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:08,240
or we huff and puff and say oh you look at me or judging other people

202
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:14,359
i didn't do this and look how good i am

203
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:23,200
that's not what the sila practice is appointing to instead

204
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,359
the practice of sicila is an integral part of cultivation of

205
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:35,359
our whole heart and mind it's integral part of the dharma path

206
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:42,880
that leads to awakening freedom from dukkha

207
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,680
and when our bodies and verbal activities are aligned with

208
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:57,520
wholesome qualities of our mind and heart our actions and the speech

209
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,680
become a natural expressions of our heart and mind

210
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,480
and they bring much benefit to ourselves and to the world

211
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,880
and so i've been sharing the bits and pieces of this mangala sutta the suit of

212
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:25,280
blessings in this past week and so i wanted to maybe read you this

213
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:32,079
as a whole and this has many pieces that um

214
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,599
speaks to the cultivation of sila and then towards the end

215
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,200
also speaks about the cultivation of the fruit uh

216
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,760
i guess the fruit of cultivation of fasila samadhi and panya heart and mind

217
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:56,960
together so you receive this blessings and

218
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:03,040
there are many translations so i'm going to share the link uh just in a moment

219
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,240
and and the translation that i've been sharing uh is

220
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:14,079
based on banti sujato and this is not the only translation so you can look at

221
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,680
the different translations and see if some of this speaks to you

222
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,360
and for me not a single translation kind of speaks uh everything um

223
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:31,520
[Music] connected with me in a way that um

224
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:40,640
i would say different translations may connect with me in different ways so feel free to explore that

225
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:47,520
so here are the blessings so it starts by

226
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:54,560
saying that there is a deity who showed up at the in front of the buddha asking the buddha

227
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:00,160
