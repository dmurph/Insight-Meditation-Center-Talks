1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,720
so good morning and good day to all of you on this

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:12,400
uh Friday and at least here in

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,680
California and if and to this is the last uh day

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,240
on this five-part introduction to Buddhist ethics and in thinking about

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:32,758
the meditation for today in relationship to that um people's ethics how they behave

6
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,719
ethically or how they behave interpersonally uh has a fair amount to

7
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:47,079
do with their state of mind their emotional state that they're in the degree of stress or lack of

8
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:54,520
stress people have people who are stressed people who are angry people who are afraid people

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,600
who are greedy uh tend towards a different ethical Behavior

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,680
than people who are calm at ease people

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,280
who are uh filled with love or generosity or

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:19,640
kindness who feel safe and contented uh these different states are

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,840
very radically different they tap into different parts of who we are and they

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,920
can lead to kind of different ways of thinking or different ways of seeing the world seeing oneself

15
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,960
and because of all that it can even uh lead to different ethical systems

16
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,880
ethical philosophies and what gets Justified and not justified and the basis for

17
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,119
that and um so in Buddhism we have

18
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:57,200
meditation we have guidelines for how to live a wise life that frees us

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,399
from stress frees us from Fear frees us

20
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:10,000
from greed and hatred hostility and anger um and

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,920
then opens up a deeper sensitivity inside a sensitivity that we feel others

22
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,440
more uh closely we feel ourselves more closely we track ourselves better

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,959
and in particular we tap into our capacity for positive social emotions

24
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:39,400
and for different times different ones come into play there's Goodwill meta there's kindness there's

25
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:46,280
basic care and compassion there's mudo kind of a deep

26
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,360
appreciative um feeling and celebration of others

27
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:59,480
well-being and there can come uh a greater sense of avoiding harm greater

28
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,519
commit to being ethical not because we think it's a good

29
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:11,000
idea but it emerges from this deeper sensitivity that can come from what

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,319
we're developing here in meditation so for this meditation I'd

31
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,239
like to suggest that um you assume you

32
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:30,840
trust that you have the capacity to tap into a deep well spring

33
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:39,200
inside of sensitivity to yourself to others to

34
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,360
calm to a place of ease maybe a place of safety

35
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,439
contentment that is the source of kindness the source of

36
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,760
compassion the Wellspring of ethical

37
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,799
behavior and what is that place inside for you and how is it in this sitting

38
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:11,560
you might tap into the depths of your emotional

39
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,079
ethical um

40
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:24,360
sensitivity so to assume a uh meditation

41
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:31,160
posture and if you're meditating for some time then you begin appreciating

42
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:38,880
the posture itself is creates a context creates a

43
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,160
familiarity creates a a it starts creating a deeper

44
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:52,759
connection to being present here with oneself for

45
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:02,639
oneself and where that connection to your body through this familiar

46
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,039
posture the act of closing your eyes or low or lowering your

47
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:13,280
gaze allows you to have a heightened

48
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,479
sensitivity to your embodied

49
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,360
experience closing your eyes and

50
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,400
feeling the width and depth of your body

51
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,960
in whatever way the body shows itself to

52
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:47,240
you with the idea of becoming quiet like you're becoming quiet to

53
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:54,120
listen to faint songs of birds in the

54
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,759
forest or quiet so you can

55
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,880
allow a sleeping baby to keep sleeping sensitive to

56
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:15,120
the sweetness of a sleeping

57
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:26,400
baby so becoming quiet to feel and sense your embodied

58
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,199
experience with an intimacy a

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,680
closeness being come becoming St sensitive to the body

60
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:55,039
breathing not so much focusing on the breath or following the

61
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:03,360
breath is letting the body be become quieter

62
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:12,080
Stiller so there's a heightened sensitivity to the body's experience of

63
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,080
breathing

64
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:38,360
with the idea that there's a partnership between breathing and your

65
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,000
awareness breathing in sensitivity to your

66
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,560
body and in that partnership the breathing is guiding you

67
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:01,440
leading you inward to a deeper and deeper Fuller and Fuller

68
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,240
sensitivity to your inner life

69
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,200
entering into this partnership with

70
00:08:51,720 --> 00:09:00,120
breathing so that there's a letting up a freeing up of the energy that goes

71
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,320
to tension and stress in your thoughts in your

72
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:21,839
body that as you feel the stress and agitations the body

73
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,320
mind there's room for them to relax and

74
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
settle

75
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
for

76
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320

78

for for

79
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:08,040
chances are that whatever you're thinking about is not as

80
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,279
valuable as the opportunity to settle into your

81
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,880
breathing into your

82
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:29,880
body gradually settling into a fuller deeper sensitivity

83
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,560
that becomes the source for kindness

84
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:44,160
Compassion Care with each

85
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,160
breath

86

e e

105
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,679
if you feel your way in to whatever degree of calm or

106
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:43,360
Stillness you have maybe behind or underneath whatever

107
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,799
agitation there might

108
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:59,559
be how does that place of calm or Stillness

109
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,760
inform how you look upon others how you see the

110
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:22,920
world can it be a place a source from which to gaze upon the

111
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:28,398
[Music] world with kindness

112
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:38,640
with an orientation to avoid causing

113
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
harm e

114
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,200
and then as we come to the end of this sitting to

115
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:08,600
consider how valuable it can be to not give ourselves

116
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,158
over to ill will to

117
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,159
stress to fear

118
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:33,720
greed to not succumb to believing in these states as being states with

119
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:40,799
which organizes how we understand and see and feel other

120
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:50,600
people but instead to stay close to the place to

121
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:57,960
stay close to being where there's no stress

122
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,640
the one inside who is not

123
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:10,880
stressed and who can gaze upon the world with

124
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:21,760
kindness being still and gazing

125
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:31,720
outwards kindly unto all beings may all all beings be

126
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,080
happy may all beings be

127
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:44,398
safe may all beings be

128
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,120
peaceful may all beings be

129
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:58,200
free and may each of us

130
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:07,760
stay close to that inner sensitivity that is the source of Good

131
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,159
Will the source of

132
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,799
nonharming may we enter the

133
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:29,360
world close to that place that wishes no harm to anyone

134
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:45,529
[Music]

135
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,559
thank

136
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,000
you for

137
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:56,200
so then we come to this fifth theme for the in this introduction

138
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:03,080
to Buddhist ethics and that is that

139
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,720
um rather

140
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,720
than doing ethics and maybe rather than being

141
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,960
ethical as the behavior we do we are

142
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,440
ethical we it's it's who we are there's no understand standing in

143
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:35,600
Buddhist ethics and Buddhist practice that as people mature

144
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:42,720
spiritually they become ethical they become someone and and the ethics like

145
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,960
the five precepts are not things that people adhere to or do or think about

146
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,840
they are simply who the person is the person is someone who does not

147
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,919
intentionally harm others a person is a person is their whole

148
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:08,080
Constitution is built in such a way that of course they're not going to take what

149
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:15,919
is not given they're not going to steal they don't have to adhere to a

150
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:23,639
precept they their whole system has kind of been transformed in such a way that

151
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:29,639
there's no tendency to the Gree to the fear to

152
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:35,240
the hatred that would lead a person to do unethical

153
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:42,440
things and so ethics then doesn't become a any kind of out

154
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:50,159
outward admonitions it's all arising in a sense from the inside but in such a way that

155
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:59,240
it's not even there's not even a a rising of Ethics it just the absence of un not of

156
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:05,360
being unethical and so this pointing to how we

157
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,679
are is really key to understanding uh the transformation that Buddhism leads

158
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:18,159
to and on the way there one of the things we want to become uh uh

159
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:24,360
increasingly attentive to is how the state of our mind the

160
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:30,600
state of our emotion emotional state has addressed direct bearing

161
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,679
on how we live how we see the world how

162
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:42,600
we interpret events that going on and how and in that that way the ethics we

163
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:48,080
live by um there's a huge difference between

164
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,039
the eth ethical orientation of someone who is stressed and someone who is not

165
00:33:54,039 --> 00:34:00,000
stressed when we're stressed we're much much more likely to to cut cor Corners

166
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:08,358
ethically or to be uninterested in ethics because we're just trying to get what we want or survive or to manage

167
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:13,878
ourselves and uh and that's too much to think about you know we're not oriented

168
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:21,398
to have this ethical sensitivity uh if we're consumed with anger uh we see the world with different

169
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:28,679
ways and if we're if we're filled with love and the kind of Ethics we justify

170
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:34,118
change varies dramatically whether we're angry or whether we're filled with love

171
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:41,679
if we're afraid or Not Afraid if we feel safe or fearful if we have a really

172
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,240
strong uh maybe biological Drive uh

173
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:54,839
desire um that tends that that will kind of uh obscure all kinds of ethical

174
00:34:54,839 --> 00:35:01,599
considerations or all kinds of heightened sensitivity for other people because the drive

175
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:09,839
overrides U sometimes real concern or care or recognition and there's a person there it's all about you know this urge

176
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:16,560
that has to be uh fulfilled and so I my assumption is that

177
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:23,119
each person lives within an ethical range uh and maybe uh it's not the

178
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,359
dramatically you know wide range but uh simple things like the kind of uh words

179
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:37,520
we speak changes based on our state of being and so as we do Buddhist medit

180
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:44,520
Buddhist practice in Buddhist Meditation in particular we start start start seeing how

181
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:52,880
our mental state changes how our physical sense of um of well-being can

182
00:35:52,880 --> 00:36:00,480
change and we start seeing the range of how this can be and how meditation can step step in and bring a sense of calm

183
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:08,520
or dramatic difference in our basic mood and state of mind and one of the one of the uh really

184
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,880
important um tasks when this we start seeing this range that we live by and

185
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:22,599
how meditation or spiritual practice gives us a positive end of that range more and more often is to start seeing

186
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:30,760
that uh understanding how our words our AC the way we think are influenced by

187
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:38,440
the state of our mind by our emotional state and um and in particular in terms

188
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:44,240
of Ethics how our ethical sensitivity uh varies depending on the

189
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:50,800
state that we're in there are times when there's no ethical sensitivity for anybody It's All About Me Myself and

190
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:57,640
mine it's all about my concerns my fears my grief my sadness in such a way that

191
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:04,640
that uh we're not really attuned to others and their needs and what harms and doesn't harm them and there are

192
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,920
other times when we are have this presence of Mind presence of heart

193
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:17,640
enough that we actually feel attuned we feel become we sensitive to other people

194
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:23,319
and sensitive to ourselves there's a way in which uh in Buddhist practice there's

195
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:28,359
a mutual there's a there's a double sensitivity that is a partnership that

196
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:35,200
really lets the whole work better than the part and that is we're set deeper and deeper sensitivity to

197
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:43,160
ourselves in such a way that we simultaneously then have a heightened sensitivity for others uh we feel others

198
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:49,240
more we care for others more uh we care for their well-being

199
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:55,560
more and um and the deeper sensitivity here also can start giving a freedom

200
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:03,040
where this the the great the deeper sensitivity in which there is a sense of

201
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:09,839
Freedom or Independence or not being pushed around not being caught um the

202
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:16,440
situations in the world doesn't get blocked or stopped in us or activate something within us that's difficult

203
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:25,240
there's an ease there's an openness there's a spaciousness for that sensitivity to uh uh in that

204
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:32,359
sensitivity for it to be wise consider it and one of the wisest uh forms of

205
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:40,359
wisdom is uh wisdom about how not to cause harm how to do the opposite how to

206
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:45,440
benefit this world how to uh come with kindness with

207
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,640
Good Will in such a way that we are uh

208
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,760
uh bringing out the best in other people that we're bringing out the best in

209
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,640
ourselves in such a way way that um that people feel safe with us because they

210
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:08,720
can feel that we have no intention to cause them harm we're not saying anything mean or maybe even sarcastical

211
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,400
which is a little bit you know edgy in a way in terms of um uh is it really uh

212
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:21,839
kind is it really sensitive to the well-being of others is it seeing people with good

213
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:29,160
will and or are we cynical in such a way that there too we limit our Capac it to

214
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:35,359
bring forth the best in all of us and um and the cynic is

215
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:42,160
probably uh being of uh limiting themselves for the best of who they are

216
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:49,480
to come forward and so this idea of kind of finding the best being sensitive to

217
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:58,319
the best with a good will with love with kindness with uh the absence of any

218
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:04,280
orientation to cause harm this is not a as I said it's not a

219
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:10,440
admonition it's not a commandment it's not an idea that comes from outside and

220
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:16,520
it's no longer a training that we have to do it it more and more becomes our

221
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:26,760
personality it becomes our character it becomes our very being um uh and um maybe not so much

222
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:33,599
because of of what we've cultivated in terms of Jo love and good will but

223
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,680
because we've let go of those inner forces that are UNH

224
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:47,040
wholesome we've uh we've learned not to give in the UNH wholesome and the AL UNH

225
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:55,680
wholesome begins to wither away and uh they're not operating and so the very Tendencies to

226
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,760
intentionally cause harm for others as

227
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,800
evaporated and um and for the person who has that kind of

228
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:15,920
ethical cleanliness or Clarity or openness or Freedom um in a sense um they're not

229
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,319
going to be puritanical they're not going to be moralistic because that begins shutting

230
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:28,119
down the eth ethical sensitivity the openness it begins to kind of uh bring

231
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:34,160
in something UNH wholesome something divides something that uh shuts out

232
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:41,760
people from the openness of our hearts there is another way there always is a

233
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,200
way that maybe not always easy to find but there is a way to change the world

234
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,760
for the better by bringing forth the best of who we

235
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,880
are and uh may that be the the uh

236
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,240
primary characteristic of of Buddhist ethics that we're bringing out the best

237
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,119
in the world through offering the best that's in in ourselves and the Buddhist

238
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:15,839
practice that we do is to uh make it possible that that comes

239
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:21,359
out of us with Integrity with wholeness so it's who we are not something we're

240
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:30,720
pretending or acting out or um but it's a really we been changed in this

241
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:38,839
way so uh that's um uh that's what um that's the

242
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:46,280
introduction to Buddhist ethics and next week there is a five-part u talk on the

243
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:53,440
five precepts and uh these are the mirrors for developing this ethical life

244
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,800
these are the guidelines for uh really being careful Not to cause harm in the

245
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:05,040
world and uh I'll be away teaching a retreat at Insight retreat center and uh

246
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:12,359
