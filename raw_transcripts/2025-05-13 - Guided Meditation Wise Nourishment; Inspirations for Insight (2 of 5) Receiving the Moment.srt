1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:08,920
and I'm curious before we get formally started here if um anyone has any

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:15,759
observations from noticing moments of simplicity or contentment or um anything

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,359
that took you away from those moments yesterday and pop that in the chat or

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:30,039
silently reflect on it consider what cultivated contentment

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,239
What supported simplicity if it emerged for you

6
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,760
yesterday so with that

7
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:05,439
With that the invitation is to settle into a posture that will support you

8
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:12,439
this morning posture that balances a

9
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,880
simple groundedness in this

10
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,040
moment and allows from some relaxation settling

11
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:41,560
in perhaps allowing a couple of longer slower breaths

12
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:59,200
and tuning in to whatever soothing

13
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,880
qualities simple qualities of

14
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:14,680
breath invite your mind your heart your attention to be present

15
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,440
and when you're ready to let your eyes

16
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:36,480
soften allow your tongue to soften and let the attention go

17
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,040
inwards noticing the weight of your body

18
00:02:52,599 --> 00:03:01,080
perhaps the sounds in the [Music] room or wherever you are

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,519
all of the sensations in the

20
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,360
body grounding through your

21
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:26,519
feet your hip points letting your hands relax

22
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:47,289
and then [Music] attuning attending [Music]

23
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,760
settling on your primary object of attention your primary

24
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:02,000
anchor perhaps sensation of the body or

25
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,720
sensation of breathing

26
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,040
and the invitation now as you're settling into

27
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:39,240
present awareness is to intentionally call up an

28
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,360
image just a simple frame in time or felt

29
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,800
sense of some time where you felt Very relaxed at ease

30
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,800
comfortable

31
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:03,040
safe and to

32
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,600
receive the feeling tone and the emotional

33
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,160
tone of this memory

34
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,800

35
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:33,080
heart recall a moment of [Music] simple pleasant contentment

36
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,440

40
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:30,520

moment

53

and appreciate the return of awareness of

54
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,160
this here now

[Music]

68
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,600
breath connected to this moment

69
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,440
as we approach the end of our sitting

70
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,720
together the invitation is to notice

71
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:01,880
Any ways you might feel more settled

72
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,880

00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:27,120
recollect any bits glimmers of goodness throughout the

75
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,360
meditation hold them in

practice the heart of your practice

78
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,840
and then perhaps with an internal gesture of

79
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:12,480
generosity offering the benefits of this practice out towards the others your

80
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,799
life touches

81
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:28,880
may they be safe happy

82
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:36,440
healthy may they be peaceful at

83
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,759
ease and free

84
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,919
and may this practice be a cause and condition to bring

85
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:54,520
about more love liberation and

86
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:00,080
peace in our hearts and in the

87
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,559
world may all beings be free

88
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:34,699
[Music]

89
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,880
thank you for the sincerity of your practice

90
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,279
so friends the theme for this week as many of you

91
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:43,320
know is um it's stories inspirations for

92
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:51,200
insight that I'll be unpacking over the course of the week and I'm weaving in some kind of

93
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,760
practice tips and um things that have worked for me and for practitioners I've supported to

94
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:04,559
support insight as it arises in practice so we'll start with an opening story

95
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:12,720
this morning which is um one that some of you are probably well familiar with but we'll be evoking

96
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,720
soaking some of the wisdom from it so as you may know the Buddha went

97
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,480
through a long phase of practicing austerities in his practice he had this

98
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:32,159
little band of um spiritual colleagues and um together they did these practices

99
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,760
that were common in ancient India where it was basically punishing their bodies

100
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,240
starving their bodies eating less and less drinking less and less over

101
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:50,600
time with the idea that it would separate them from being bound to the um

102
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:56,320
entanglements sensual pleasures and karma of their lives at one point he

103
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,720
describes in the ancient discourse as being down to a grain or two of rice a

104
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,240
day so it was in this period before he was awakened he was still striving for

105
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:15,200
awakening that um this story unfolds he is sitting under a tree quite

106
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,840
starved and thin and nearby a young woman the daughter of

107
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,760
some wellto-do farmers had a dream encouraging her to go make a food

108
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:34,880
offering to someone and she um trusted this dream

109
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,159
she went out and encountered this emaciated man sitting under a tree and

110
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:47,679
was moved to offer him rice porridge kind of a high quality food at the time

111
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:55,440
and although the Buddha had been committed committed to this path of austerity and we think nowadays

112
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:02,760
deprivation for quite a while something stirred in him and he accepted the

113
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:09,040
offering and ate it and the myths around the ancient

114
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:18,398
teaching of his awakening describe him um being nourished by this and I imagine

115
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:26,320
by the kindness of the offering as well and going to sit in meditation and in

116
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,079
the discourses he describes a memory from childhood arising of being in the

117
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:38,240
shade of a rose apple tree looking out over the fields at his father um the

118
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,919
king in a plowing festival kind of a happy time and that in this

119
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:53,240
content relaxed way he became absorbed in the moment very

120
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,480
pleasurable And as he sat there in meditation this memory arose and the

121
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:05,880
recognition came to him oh this is a wholesome pleasure this is not to be

122
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:12,000
feared and that memory and that recognition caused him to let go of this

123
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,760
austere kind of punishing way that he had been practicing and conceive of the

124
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,079
middle way of Buddhist practice in some versions of this story

125
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:32,640
he actually became awakened that very night so familiar story to many what

126
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:39,040
inspirations towards insight what qualities supporting our minds might be

127
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,280
evoked from this i invite you to evoke your own

128
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,839
and when I reflect on it it strikes me that the Buddha actually received three

129
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:58,800
forms of nourishment nutrition for his practice that day the first was the

130
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,400
physical nutrition of food the second was contact with this

131
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:11,720
person's generosity and kindness and the receptivity of be being able to take it

132
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:18,680
in and this nourishment this perhaps nurturing of kindness appears to have

133
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:25,160
shifted a mood or quality in his heart and

134
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:31,760
mind and that brings up the third form of nutrition that he received that day

135
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,160
because that change of heart somehow called up an

136
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:43,839
associated related memory from his childhood which in of itself inspired

137
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:50,040
this wise voluitional shift in his practice

138
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:57,800
so let's talk about those second two forms of nourishment contact with

139
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:04,960
nourishment because the way the Buddha appears to have processed his experience

140
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,079
has wisdom that might inform or support your practice my

141
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:18,960
practice so the Buddha was literally practicing austerities in a way that he later discovered weren't helpful

142
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,079
now as then it's really easy impossible

143
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:30,760
for anyone to have this kind of inner attitude of austerity stinginess

144
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:38,599
contraction self-punishment all of which are unhelpful attitudes to the

145
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:45,599
practice there's even a milder version of this which is a scarcity mentality

146
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:52,560
the same experience in meditation can be very differently received very

147
00:37:52,560 --> 00:38:00,400
differently framed in terms of a lack or a loss or a problem or on the other hand

148
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:10,119
in terms of absence a beautiful kind of spaciousness even dissolution allowing wisdom

149
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:17,680
mindset qualities of mind are core for example there's three different

150
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:25,440
ways that practitioners I've accompanied have um related to the ending of a sublime

151
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:36,480
state of concentration of Janna one the state ends and like most humans

152
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:45,040
ending something very pleasurable or unusual or interesting the person grasps at it tries to keep it feels irritated

153
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:51,680
bereff at the fault for being distracted or maybe makes up a lot of stories about

154
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:59,520
what's wrong with them or what went wrong or how great I was that it happened all of that

155
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:06,400
such grasping aversion story making it isn't necessarily a mistake per se

156
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:13,599
overall because it's part of the training however it isn't onward leading

157
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:20,160
in the sense of um helping to evoke insight in the

158
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:30,400
moment it's part of the muck that the lotus grows from so very human so very

159
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:35,920
understandable okay another way second way practitioner might relate to the

160
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,640
same exact event the dissolving of a concentration state it's gone they might

161
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:49,359
accept it lightly and shrug like oh gone okay and there's a lightness and a sense

162
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:56,320
of equinimity or even delight gratitude for having had it

163
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:04,680
so that that's a more wholesome onwardleading way of relating and then

164
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:11,560
third a practitioner might attend to the end of the exact same beautiful

165
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,960
experience but attending to it with continuous mindfulness and attention and

166
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,720
notice all of the details of the change in their state of mind and the change of

167
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,000
what's arising in the moment and experience the end of that

168
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:35,440
concentration state as insight same event three different

169
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,960
mental conditions and qualities of mind and I want to stress these aren't

170
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,000
necessarily anyone's fault or that they should be lionized for them their conditions coming

171
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:54,000
together to recognize our part in those conditions is noticing appreciating and

172
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:03,560
gradually cultivating more and more capacity for mindfulness awareness steadiness and for

173
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:11,040
noticing the qualities of mind and that brings us to the story

174
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,079
what the story implies about how the Buddha related to the memory of being

175
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:22,960
this content absorbed kid under a tree so early in my own retreat practice

176
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:29,760
I definitely became entranced with similar memories maybe you have too most

177
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,119
of us are one memory arises and all of

178
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:41,280
the sudden all these unfolding similar memories come along cluster along for

179
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,880
the ride or um we might compare why can't it

180
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,680
be like that now or get um pulled off into other trains of thought in this case like

181
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,760
related trains of thought about trees or childhood or family or even farming

182
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:06,760
it's clear from this story that that's not what happened for the Buddha that

183
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:13,520
night instead rather than being entranced he was attentive however he

184
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,920
didn't necessarily follow the basic mindfulness instructions that are often

185
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:26,520
given and simply label that memory as thinking or remembering and discard it

186
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:34,640
instead he took the wisdom from it he allowed it to inform him in the

187
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:41,280
moment so this isn't an invitation to discursive thinking in your meditation

188
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:48,640
but rather an invitation to be open to the quiet wisdom the quiet messages that

189
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:55,000
our psyches may produce as the heart and mind settle

190
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:03,280
settle as a sense of kindness and safety contentment and simplicity begin to be

191
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:09,319
more accessible more wisdom also becomes

192
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:17,920
available it may take the form of a still small voice that speaks a few words that turn

193
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:26,200
the practice it's quite a different tone and sensibility than internal chatter or

194
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:34,800
narration or it may take the form of an image like being under a tree

195
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,119
there's an art to being able to sense the goodness the wisdom in the content

196
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:49,599
of whatever is arising in our minds while seeing the content and the arising in

197
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,920
the present moment oh thought

198
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:04,400
of if we're not pulled into thoughts as realities they become potential signals now and then or simple

199
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:11,119
ways of knowing very simple for shifts in the practice that can move the mind

200
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:18,640
closer to insight freedom happiness

201
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:26,000
a way of using our dharma intelligence to include the content of the mind and

202
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,319
heart as well as the process and if done with discernment without magical

203
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:37,839
thinking without assigning retroactive meaning then we can experience

204
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:43,040
conditions and connections in the moment that are like a breadcrumb trail towards

205
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,200
insight it's a different way of structuring

206
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:55,359
understanding present moment experience some people some teachers SAI

207
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:02,800
is one call this inclusion of both process and content 5050 mindfulness or

208
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:10,280
5050 awareness one teacher calls it 360°ree

209
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:18,319
awareness for some people at a certain point in the deepening of samadei or at

210
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:26,079
certain levels of approaching insight visual images are common like this or

211
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:32,560
felt sense in the body if there's continuous mindfulness and awareness and

212
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,680
by continuous I don't mean all the time little bursts of continuity are fine a

213
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,400
few seconds is all it takes if there's this continuous awareness of our general

214
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:51,280
mood mindset or mind state even for a few seconds such memories arisings in

215
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:58,880
the heart and mind kesthetic heard seen can become part of

216
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,960
a wisdom oriented way of seeing like signposts in the

217
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:12,480
moment pointing to a wiser way to navigate our hearts minds and inner

218
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:18,640
lives so in conclusion wise nourishment

219
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:25,760
invites depth of practice and insight i want to encourage you over the

220
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:33,680
next 24 hours to allow a kind of receptive kind quality of mind and see

221
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:41,640
what emerges what might release from a contracted or scarcity mentality

222
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:51,920
this kind of nourishment of the goodness within helps to develop discernment to deepen wisdom about

223
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,200
relating to both the process of our minds and hearts and lives and

224
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:05,480
everything that we see within them thank you for your kind attention
