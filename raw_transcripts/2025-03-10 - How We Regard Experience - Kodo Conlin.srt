1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,440
hi thank you nice to be with

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,080
you we've been uh we've been sitting with our eyes closed I'm just taking you all

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:17,680
in what a treat we all seem to have made it um

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,960
Beyond daylight savings time um many of you know me uh as the

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,920
co-managing Director at uh imc's Retreat Center over the hill the Insight retreat

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:39,440
center and last night uh Gil and bruny are there teaching uh 40 or 45 yogis and

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,520
there was a there was a very long spiel about the clocks changing because the

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,920
the uh the Yogi's minds are quite still and quiet and I was I was pleased by the care that

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,760
went into the clock's changing announcement and the giggles that were coming out of the meditation Hall

10
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,560
so the the topic I want to talk about today is how we reg regard experience or

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:16,159
how we relate to experience um my own route through practice has

12
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,079
been a rather winding one and I think that may be true for for

13
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,280
many or all of us that uh the content of our lives and the and the steps we take

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:35,320
through this life there's so many each of us has our own challenges each of us has our own

15
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:42,360
strengths um but there's something there's something that the Dharma offers which is

16
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:50,078
um at least in theory can be applied to All Things how we regard

17
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,119
experience one of the reasons that this practic is uh maybe a

18
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,439
little mysterious isn't quite the right word but maybe uh let's say let's say

19
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:09,840
deep multifaceted is we have so many instructions uh I was I was doing I I

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,680
like to count uh I was doing some counting depending on how you look at mindfulness of breathing we might have

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,000
16 instructions or four depending on how you want to look at them Sati patana if

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,120
you look through the the mind the foundations of mindfulness suta depending on how you count it maybe

23
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,640
there's a dozen Maybe 13 and then the majima 119 mindfulness

24
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,200
of the body there's another 10 there's some overlap in all these but it is your mind

25
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,519
spinning with instruction but rather than rather than

26
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:54,080
take these as um sort of scattering one way we can gather them all together is uh Joseph Goldstein has

27
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,599
this great piy quote that there's only ever six things going on

28
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,959
there's uh sight sound smells tastes

29
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:16,080
touch and then mental activity that's that simplifies things

30
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,080
no down from 30 30 something but in the practice we have

31
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,200
these we have these sort of let's say traditional or time honored ways of applying our

32
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,959
attention uh it in very specific ways that help to grow the path to grow the

33
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,920
grow the steps of the

34
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,400
path just to strengthen this point about Joseph Goldstein and the six things aan

35
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,239
cha the uh Thai Forest teacher said that actually where practice

36
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:59,799
happens is where the Mind meets a sense object maybe in other words we could say

37
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:06,280
that's where attention meets sights sounds smells tastes touch and mind if

38
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,959
any of you have read Gill's book uh the issue at hand there's this lovely little uh thing I think it's in the

39
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:18,400
preface where um he talks about it it's so much it's so much more maybe skillful

40
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,320
or easier to pay attention to the the the point of contact with experience I

41
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,120
think he uses this metaphor of uh walking on a rocky road and that every every step that's

42
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,400
like a oh ouch little rocks ouch ouch uh and rather than trying to sweep the road

43
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,759
clear of rocks we put on shoes we put on shoes and in a similar

44
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,039
way uh rather than trying to sweep all the Rocks away from our six sense spaces

45
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:52,280
if you will taking really good care of this point of contact so how we relate

46
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,600
to experience

47
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:11,039
so I want to tell some stories uh that sort of illustrate this the the first the first illustrates the

48
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,240
fact that in our in our mindfulness practice there are two qualities that are being cultivated in

49
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,880
Tandem and uh sometimes these are translated as Serenity and

50
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:30,120
insight there's the there's the calming the stilling of the mind and then there is the clear seeeing

51
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,280
familiar territory and these are these work best when they're developed

52
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,319
together so why is that first story

53
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:50,120
is when I was a when I was a young boy seems like forever ago I was given a

54
00:05:52,240 --> 00:06:00,560
telescope and I was delighted I was something of an astronomy Enthusiast when I was a a little one

55
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,840
the the trouble was um I couldn't figure out how to set up the

56
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:14,759
tripod uh and I it did not occur to me in my young boy mind to ask for

57
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,199
help poor little one so uh instead of instead of asking

58
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,440
for help uh I decided I'm just I'm going to my gray telescope I'm just going to

59
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:36,479
try to hold it and you know it seems reasonable enough right so I'm I'm out on the I think I'm

60
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,680
on the porch and it's night sky and I can see the astral something that I want

61
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:49,479
to look at maybe a star and uh I I kind of point the telescope at the at the

62
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:55,560
star and I put my eye down to the viewfinder it looks still enough but when I look down in the viewfinder

63
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,039
there's just nothing it's it's a haze it's like hazy nothing I can't I can't

64
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,879
see because the telescope isn't still and this is how this is how the

65
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:13,440
the functioning of uh uh Serenity and insight work the tripod is the serenity

66
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,319
of course and the Insight is the telescope if I had had this a stable

67
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,440
base I may have been able to see all sorts of things but when these two qualities

68
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:31,680
develop together um they begin to unveil all sorts of layers of our

69
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,840
experience there's this lovely verse in the damam that something like for for one

70
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:45,720
with Insight no for one without insight there is no

71
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:52,639
meditative absorption and for one without meditative absorption there's no

72
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:59,159
Insight but with both one is quite close to nibana was quite close to the goal of

73
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:06,560
the bre practice this ending of greed hatred and delusion our various practices can

74
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:15,440
emphasize one side or the other or they can emphasize both but when they're both mature we can really fly really

75
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,680
fly they also have um suring Serenity and insight that they not only have

76
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,320
meditative implications but I think it's worth mentioning that they have ethical implic

77
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:37,159
also maybe we can take the point that the the more clearly we see inside

78
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:44,000
ourselves and and outside uh how different our actions

79
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,560
become I was reading in the in the sutas this morning and uh and found found one

80
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,200
I hadn't seen in a long time which said uh said something like a

81
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,320
mind without delusion uh uh is a whole wholesome

82
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,640
mind and what one does with a mind without delution is also

83
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:12,000
wholesome and that's it seems simple enough but that's an import that's an important shift from just the mind

84
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,440
without delusion is wholesome to what we do with that mind is also

85
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,519
wholesome so there's there are these ethical implications to Serenity and

86
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:35,640
insight so talk about the just one other way uh there is the the what of our

87
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:42,040
experience and the how of experience the what we might say these are the sights

88
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:49,760
sounds smells tastes touch mental Activity six sense

89
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,600
bases and then the how of course is how we relate how we

90
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,680
relate and it's a fascinating thing to to to look at what sort of what sort of

91
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,800
perspective or what sort of attitude what sort of how is the mind taking up at any

92
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:14,880
moment and then how is that influencing both how I'm seeing and um how I relate to

93
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,880
others the how is important of course because it conditions so much of how we

94
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:28,040
suffer um and some of the some of the stories I want to tell I think I think we'll get into that but uh one one very

95
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,320
innocent example about the the how of experience um is any it do we have any

96
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,959
coffee drinkers in the maybe you'll be able to U relate to this I know when when I wake up in the

97
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,600
morning often when I right before I go to bed I think ah coffee's coming in the [Laughter]

98
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:55,920
morning H and then uh wake up in the morning and uh alarm sounds is it time to get up

99
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,959
okay maybe a maybe a thought has arisen but things really kick off when at the eye door when I see the coffee

100
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:09,680
grinder and then I start you know all that happened was a little bit of contact at the eye door but all of this

101
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,560
proliferation starts oh my perfect cup oh oh I hope I have enough of my

102
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:21,959
favorite dairyfree creamer uh the desire the craving the thinking all of this all of this gets

103
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:30,600
going all on the basis of just all all that happened really was I saw some I saw a coffee grinder

104
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,320
so uh that's innocent innocent

105
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,720
enough so a couple of

106
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,519
stories last September I was sitting a three-week retreat at at IRC something

107
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:55,200
really special I think we do this is my asside to again share that

108
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:05,240
I'm just having an upwelling of what an amazing Community IMC and IRC are uh this is not what I wrote but um uh we

109
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:11,880
had a um we had a volunteer appreciation event sometime last year and uh

110
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,440
uh there it was stunning I I was sitting right over there it was stunning to see

111
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,760
just that as an expression of how many people make the make IMC I don't even

112
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:29,560
want to say make IMC possible like they make IMC you make it it's amazing are IMC

113
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:37,480
you're doing IMC what a what a cool thing all right back to them back to the

114
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:44,000
story so um last September at at IRC sitting this Retreat and little

115
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,680
little did I know that um must have been shortly before the September Retreat a new a new neighbor

116
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:57,000
moved in and the the neighbor uh four

117
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,560
legs tail and barks barks Barks A Lot

118
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,040
Barks A lot so I did a I did a lot of my meditating

119
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:16,120
in my in in my room with the windows open and it was uh at the ear door bark bark bark

120
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:24,519
bark bark bark bark bark sometimes okay that's the what of the experience and the how sometimes I would hear the bark

121
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:31,120
I would hear the bark and what would happen annoyance agitation you feel the feel the

122
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,360
sensations in the body mindful mindful

123
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,959
um and then based on that uh based on that agitation that aversion these

124
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,120
thoughts started coming some of them were I wonder how long a dog could bark

125
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,240
before it gets tired there must be a

126
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,600
limit um and then it was uh gosh I'm the

127
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,000
director there are 40 people here I wonder do I need to go over there and like have a conversation with my

128
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,079
neighbor about their dog um I didn't choose to do

129
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:18,199
that uh let's see just to say all that happened was a

130
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:23,480
sound and all this scheming started happening and other times other times

131
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,680
the bark would come up mindfulness would know and uh there would be absolutely no

132
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:37,639
reaction whatsoever completely neutral not intentional on my

133
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:44,959
part and then still later sometimes sometimes the bark would come I hear the

134
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:52,399
bark and who knows who put this reaction there it would be what what a lovely dog

135
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:58,040
I just love this dog I cannot wait to meet this pup who's moved into my

136
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,800
neighborhood is full of meta it's remarkable interesting thing about all

137
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:10,480
this uh this first story is that um it didn't deliberately cultivate the

138
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:18,800
different responses it was just mindfulness and and conditions coming together so uh

139
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,800
what does that mean it means our reactions to things are not stuck they're not

140
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:33,199
fixed uh they they are they're they're both changeable and they are changing if we wait long

141
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,959
enough it's kind of like the

142
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:53,839
weather so a little bit of a a different location Second Story was um uh tasahara

143
00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:00,079
has anyone been to tasahara yeah yeah so the Zen Monastery that I I

144
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,759
moved to California for

145
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,920
um loved being there it's just beautiful out in the out in the Ventana

146
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:18,720
Wilderness kind of in a in a in a valley with a little Creek Running by and the

147
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:26,800
cabins are built along the creek very very cool place to practice and I was working in the kitchen uh at this time

148
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,800
so

149
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:37,519
this [Music] uh this story is about deliberate

150
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,680
cultivation The Last Story shows that some sometimes things change on their own this one needed a little nudging

151
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,759
because this was a very stubborn habit I'm working in the kitchen and occasionally I would I would um I would

152
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:56,319
drop something like a whisk or a bowl or some food or something uh maybe I drop a

153
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:02,600
glass and it would break and I would notice any anytime I would drop something the mind would have its

154
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:10,640
response more or less G G I was I was agitated at the fact that I had dropped

155
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,798
something seeing this happen enough times and uh just knowing it wasn't

156
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:21,360
really shifting Shifting the pattern I was motivated to make a change because I

157
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:28,960
noticed that not only did the G make me really uncomfortable I was I was making my own suffering worse

158
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,320
with the adding agitation on top and then it it wasn't doing any favors for

159
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:41,799
the the mood of the kitchen and the people around me so I I was having an

160
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:48,760
effect so I decided to to try something completely different which now I know the Buddha calls replacing the

161
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:58,360
peg where anytime I dropped something I would uh I would deliberately in my mind go yes

162
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:06,120
and some sometimes I would do this out loud uh and it sounds really silly but

163
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:12,720
it it it totally worked it really worked so so uh it came to be that in that in

164
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:20,240
the kitchen I would drop something yes what a rise Pleasant Sensations rather than agitation that led on to

165
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:27,880
upset and the the the training the the mental training of replacing the peg was so effective that now um I'm not

166
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:37,480
encouraging you to break anything but e even if I hear someone else drop something my mind will go yes and and

167
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:45,679
the pleasant will come the pleasant will come it's a much better condition for a happy mind um I told this story U maybe

168
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,960
three years ago at tasahara when I was not working in the kitchen and uh the K the the folks who were working in the

169
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:59,158
kitchen for that practice period picked it up as a practice so it's spreading

170
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:07,799
so that's replacing the peg um again it's it's a it's a kind of

171
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:15,400
light-hearted story but it m it makes a really important point that if we choose to we can deliberately cultivate a

172
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:22,320
different how to experience um yeah it's not it's not

173
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:30,399
necessarily not necessarily to force anything out of our experience but just bring some other conditions in

174
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:43,200
so this third story it's a it's another Retreat story and it's uh it's it's more subtle

175
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,600
we can say it's um it's in the sort of place where the

176
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:59,000
Serenity and insight had some momentum it's been a it's been a long retreat by the time this happens in the the story

177
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,799
what I and what I came to notice in the the the the Stillness and the

178
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:12,200
clarity was that there was a very subtle almost

179
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:18,440
invisible um attitude it was kind of like a tiny little seed that was

180
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:25,640
coloring uh every aspect of experience that uh I hadn't even known

181
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,280
it was there but it there was like there was just a slight Distortion to

182
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:41,400
everything and the clo as I as I tuned into that little seed what I saw was that it was a very small seed of

183
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,480
fear and that that that fear was it was pervasive it was like everything that arose at the eye there was a little bit

184
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:55,200
of fear every sound every thought you know every sensation in the body that the the entire how of experience was

185
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,039
fear it was really really subtle but there's something in those in those

186
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:08,159
meditative spaces where I mean seeing something so small can be so

187
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,360
powerful and can constitute a shift you you can imagine what a what a

188
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,760
change comes if you put a say you put a giant lever at just the right place and

189
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:25,679
you can move it just the tiniest bit just and the and the whole world

190
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:32,279
changes so in in this case the the how of fear just by being known

191
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:38,159
with mindfulness and uh Clarity with Serenity and insight something allowed

192
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,640
it to let go nothing really

193
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,919
happened that's anticlimactic story but um sometime later sometime later that

194
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:58,000
day there was this total unbidden uh Vision it was like new eyes

195
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,640
that the world the world could be seen and known without fear it's somehow it dropped away on its

196
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,880
own without without really doing anything and then this big upwelling

197
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:18,279
that I did not ask for of beautiful confidence came and just to see that for a moment

198
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:23,320
oh that that that confidence was a that's a different option for a how for

199
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:30,320
how to relate to experience it sure didn't last forever

200
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,760
um but it was it was enough it was enough to to show and to show this

201
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:45,520
beautiful possibility and also for the the body and the mind to get an imprint like oh this is possible this is

202
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:55,320
different so it's another case where it's not exactly like um confidence was cultivated it

203
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:01,320
wasn't exactly a deliberate cultivation in that way but uh as you hear Gil talk about all

204
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:08,200
the time we're putting the conditions in place for something to unfold and in the way we're talking

205
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:14,480
about it today we're putting Serenity and insight or we're talking about the how of experience the how we relate to

206
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,840
experience really taking care of that and then that that making way for for

207
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:28,158
the unfolding of something rather beautiful or freeing or easier

208
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:43,600
so mindfulness it's a pretty easy relationship to experience let me say that a different way it's not

209
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:51,840
easy but it's sure not complicated it's a very simple relationship to experience Boo

210
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,080
and alio has a as a real succinct way he puts this he writes that one task of

211
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:03,440
mindfulness is to remain generally aware of the process of

212
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,080
experience without reacting to specific sense

213
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:16,520
objects that sentence is a little complicated one task of

214
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:22,320
mindfulness is to remain generally aware of the process of

215
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,880
experience without reacting to specific sense objects

216
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,559
to put that uh as I've been saying in a in a in a more simple way we have these

217
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:43,640
six sense objects the what of experience and one task of mindfulness is simply to to know

218
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:51,000
them to know them without reactivity so all three all three of

219
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,640
these stories kind of say something about that how and what's possible for

220
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,480
us um if there's some curiosity about

221
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:10,480
practicing with the how uh practicing with the how we relate to experience um borrowing from auta and

222
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,880
the samut Naya there's some uh there maybe some some

223
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:23,080
Reflections or things you can look toward in your in your own meditative experience one is are there thoughts

224
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:29,200
present maybe you can get to know the how how am I relating to experience by seeing are there thoughts present

225
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,480
and a secondary question uh asking yourself are these

226
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,240
true second thing of Leaning into the third Foundation of mindfulness is there

227
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:48,240
an attitude present so thoughts

228
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,399
attitude third um am I knowingly or unknowingly

229
00:25:54,399 --> 00:26:02,159
cultivating something in my third story Maybe I was I was unknowingly conditioning

230
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:10,640
fear uh and in the Second Story I was deliberately cultivating a more uh Pleasant response to dropping

231
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:18,039
stuff am I knowingly or unknowingly cultivating something and then fourth how simple is my

232
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:25,240
seeing how simple is my relationship to experience or how complicated is it

233
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,640
so I might say that the um this practice has a

234
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:45,159
trajectory it has a movement an onward leading movement and this uh unification of

235
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:50,480
Serenity and insight it uh it reveals both our our

236
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:57,679
what of experience and our how of experience um and then moves onward

237
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:06,200
through these VAR deep insights these Notions of uh uh seeing things as they've come to

238
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:13,200
be um then ceasing to be enchanted by those

239
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,600
things the the gradual fading away of craving and then knowing a mind that's

240
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:29,520
free that's amazing that is pretty amazing it makes me so glad that this place exists

241
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,480
another Gil ISM related to

242
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:44,360
Liberation more or less says something like it's not us who become

243
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,679
awakened but with Awakening we we liberate all things from

244
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:56,360
us yeah that that makes that makes once huh that's a very different how in

245
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,120
relationship to experience

246
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:18,240
there's a really there's a really um seems like a to me a an

247
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:28,720
interesting relationship in the sutas that I don't think we talk about all that much but occasionally the um

248
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,240
I think it's called the ruler of the dvas Saka comes and asks the Buddha a

249
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,240
question that's always that gets my attention and uh Saka in this

250
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:48,440
case comes to basically ask what why is it that some some

251
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:55,399
beings uh are liberated and others are not that's a good

252
00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:01,399
question in my opinion and what what do you imagine the

253
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:08,279
Buddhist response might have been I could imagine any number of responses but I was delighted in turning this

254
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:15,200
theme in my mind that the the Buddha the Buddha talks about eyes and sights ears and sounds

255
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,240
nose and smells tongue and tastes body tangibles mind and mind

256
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:28,159
objects and more or less says uh the beings that grasp on to

257
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,480
those objects are not liberated and the beings

258
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,600
that uh don't grasp that's the difference it's the the

259
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,240
relationship to experience

260
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,559
um last night last night at at IRC there was this there was this very short Q&A

261
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:58,039
it's kind of a part of the process of coming out of retreat and um I won't share share the details for

262
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:03,399
for the person's privacy but there was someone describing something really beautiful they had seen they had seen in

263
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:08,600
themselves a certain letting go over the course of the retreat they had seen a way that they had been causing suffering

264
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,159
for themselves and that um it was a seemingly wholesome value that they had

265
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,640
but they realized that they were grasping after it really hard

266
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:25,200
uh and the response that I heard was oh

267
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,960
um instead of holding it like this

268
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:38,000
you can hold it like this so still keep it

269
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,480
close that's an important value but you can you can you can hold

270
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:50,559
it close with these Open Hands maybe that's in the same

271
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:58,039
family so this trajectory

272
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:07,399
I want to close with some in these verses from the the the book of eights

273
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:13,679
theava that um I think I think as you hear them

274
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:20,200
um maybe maybe maybe it can be maybe it's something inspiring to me it's it's

275
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:27,000
uh it's both inspiring and it it points to the ethical implications of what we're doing the sort of beauty of a free

276
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,960
heart and how a person like that lives in the world uh inspiring maybe because that's

277
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,240
that's the the possibility that's available for us at least in Walking The

278
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:45,080
Path uh two little bits of explanation before I I share the verses is there are

279
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:51,679
some there are two there are two very strange Clauses in here if I don't explain there will be question

280
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,559
marks uh one is that it it describes a sage a free person as someone who is

281
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:03,919
fake less faithless uh I did not understand this

282
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,399
uh until I read the commentary uh and uh the the

283
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:15,679
understanding is that perhaps it's a person who has gone beyond uh gone beyond having to have

284
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:21,919
faith in something else because they've been they've been so freed of greed hatred and delusion that they know it

285
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:28,720
for themselves that the faith doesn't have to be out there does that make sense

286
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:35,480
and then the other related piece is that they don't free themselves from

287
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:43,360
Passion because the work has already been done so these uh these verses describe a

288
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:50,960
stage a free person not clinging to the

289
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,039
Future nor grieving the past they see seclusion in the midst of

290
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,518
sense context and are not Guided by

291
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:09,200
views they are neither clinging nor deceitful not greedy or

292
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:17,440
stingy neither impudent nor offensive and don't engage in malicious

293
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:24,120
speech neither addicted to what's Pleasant nor given to

294
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:29,360
arrogance gentle and intelligent they are faithless and don't free themselves

295
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,880
from Passion always equanimous and mindful in

296
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,039
this world they don't think of themselves as equal Superior or

297
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:48,080
inferior they have no swollen Pride depending on

298
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,480
nothing having known the dhma they are

299
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,519
independent they have no craving for becoming and not becoming

300
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:04,279
I say they are at peace they who are not concerned with sensual

301
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:09,519
Pleasures they have no bonds and have crossed Beyond

302
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,720
attachments maybe it's enough to just say I say they are at

303
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:29,720
peace I'm wishing for that for for all of us now and in the future

304
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,200
um maybe to to close with a word of appreciation which is uh as as I've said

305
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:46,679
in the beginning the middle and now the end uh there's something like arriving

306
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:54,839
at IMC there is something lovely about being in being in

307
00:34:54,839 --> 00:35:01,240
the field and maybe it has something to do with this that we're we're oriented

308
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:06,359
toward not grasping or oriented toward not being

309
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:13,079
malicious or oriented toward peace or being wise about

310
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:22,119
that and maybe there's something we're doing here that that can uh support us in what's not an easy

311
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:29,640
world uh not only support us but support us to uh

312
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,640
engage and do that beautifully more like

313
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,960
this so thank you for your attention I think we have a just a few

314
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:50,359
minutes for um questions if you like or comments

315
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:08,760
Beautiful Stories thank you I'm curious if that dog you mentioned had Buddha

316
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:16,319
nature nice nice he didn't say [Music]

317
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:37,440
thank you so much that was a a beautiful offering I really appreciate it um in the last reading there was a

318
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,599
line that I'd like to know more about which was something to the effect that

319
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:50,960
to not give up passion but shortly after talking about equinity and um maybe you could talk a

320
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:57,640
little bit more about that right right I think that's the the line they are

321
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:03,880
faithless and don't free themselves from Passion and then right after it says always equanimous and mindful in this

322
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:09,480
world they don't think of themselves as equal Superior or inferior right

323
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:17,880
yeah uh the the way that I make sense of that that that particular line is it's

324
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,280
the the the same Principle as the faithless point that they they've they

325
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:30,400
have already freed themselves of when a when we use the word passion here I think I think Gil is translating

326
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,760
Raga which um which is like it's not the sort of passion that

327
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:45,720
we think of as as a inspiration or even vow or resolve passion it's like

328
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,680
um uh sometimes the Buddha will describe something like the the senses being overtaken with a

329
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,520
fever it's that it's that sort of thing the mind the the mind and the the senses

330
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,720
com yeah just overtaken um sometimes also has this

331
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:09,240
this uh tone of relishing yeah so that that's I think that's an important distinction when we

332
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:15,480
we use when we use the English word passion because we we end up losing if we throw if we throw out everything

333
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,640
that's involved in the English word passion we're we're we're losing so much but we're also kind of

334
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,599
missing the distinction I don't know if that's what you're asking though yeah that makes

335
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:30,160
sense yeah yeah great

336
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,880
great you related to that question so the resolve and inspiration how does

337
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:49,560
that connect to the yeah to me very isn't it right on

338
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,960
the okay but I think everyone heard me yeah yeah so to repeat the question

339
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:02,880
maybe for folks online um uh um how does the passionless relate to fa Faith or

340
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:10,400
can you say it again I got it wrong yeah when you mentioned resolve to me Resolve seems very faithful right and so excuse

341
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:18,640
me so the faithless how does it connect right right right right thank you for the question um I think um have to

342
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:25,759
consider it in sequence so uh I think I think

343
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,040
the yeah we have faith in our in where we're headed like when we we put our

344
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:38,359
energy into resolve because we have faith or confidence that the practice is working this is good but please keep

345
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:44,119
this up may you all have lots of faith in uh in yourselves in your practice the

346
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:49,640
way um the way we talk about faith in the faith in uh Buddhist

347
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:58,520
practice there's this interesting turn where it goes from what they call Bright Faith to uh uh kind of like confirmed

348
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:05,480
faith and the the mo the move is based on having seen greed in the mind and

349
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:12,000
then at a later time that greed is not in the mind and then that bolsters your faith

350
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,640
that oh the the practice is working oh look I'm not I'm not consumed with this all the time same for hatred and

351
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:26,160
delusion anyway uh I think the principle holds that we we we need to have faith in the

352
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,680
fact that the the practice work works and then once you have once you once the

353
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:38,000
the path has been fulfilled uh you don't have to believe it I think that's I think that's part of the point kind of

354
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,640
like when you arrive at the Grand Canyon no one has to tell you about it anymore or you don't have to believe it's there

355
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:48,720
because you're looking at it does that make sense

356
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:58,400
cool there's a question online um the person asks how to attend to how I am

357
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:06,280
with the moment without too much selfing how to attend to how I am with the moment without too much selfing if they

358
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:12,240
were here I would ask them if they could say a little bit more about what they notice about the

359
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,760
selfing um I'll see if they respond we'll see if they

360
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:32,359
respond yeah yeah maybe to try to respond in some

361
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:38,319
way of course it it can seem uh it can seem like a whole lot of doing and a

362
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:44,119
whole lot of meing meing me doing the doing if I'm like

363
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:52,400
tracking uh oh did they did they happen yeah they responded making more of a story

364
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,520
focusing on the story of me making more of a story focusing on the story story

365
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,800
of me yeah it's it's hard to know it's hard to know exactly what's what's meant so

366
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,560
I'll I'll try to respond in some way

367
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:23,078
um I think there there are two things that I I'd like to note one of them is that

368
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,559
um when we practice when we practice mindfulness say we're practicing mindfulness of the body we're staying

369
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:35,599
very close to the six sense doors let's say it's actually a great simplification

370
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:41,240
of experience it it allows them allows the mind to settle on something something

371
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:50,240
much more simple than our um the the novel of me um or like focusing on like turning

372
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:56,000
turning to the sight of a glass of water is much more simple uh much more

373
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,319
simple in terms of experience a story about it and part of how part of how

374
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:07,800
mindfulness practice can work is that by by staying very close keeping our attention very close to the body and

375
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:16,000
doing that in a way that's steady maybe it's kind um it um it actually softens all

376
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,599
that gripping that creates the self story and then there's room for something else to

377
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:29,880
come yeah I hope that was semi adequate uh for for what was uh actually needed

378
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,119
great so we're just at time and I want to thank you for your practice this

379
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:40,200
morning in your attention and uh for being and doing

380
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:48,839
IMC may we uh may we all have such a beautiful place to practice take care
