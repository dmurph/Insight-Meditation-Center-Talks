00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:08,080
hello from Redwood City the Insight Meditation Center and uh welcome to

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,000
this uh day's meditation and uh as an

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,480
introduction there is a a wise approach to or a very direct

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:30,720
approach to mindfulness practice uh and that is is that to the

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:38,680
degree to which Insight vas is involved seeing a form of clear

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:46,320
seeing some people are looking for something but what what we're it's

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,719
useful to think of that what we're looking for is how we're

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:01:00,399
seeing what we're looking for is in the seeing itself not in what's being seen

9
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,119
uh you know through the eyes or heard through the ears or tasted through the

10
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:12,520
tongue and so forth It's the manner by which we know that we're

11
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:20,920
aware that is the that's where the secret the key is

12
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:27,040
found so an analogy would be that if um

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,640
we are given um uh uh someone someone says I have a

14
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,759
wonderful means by which for you to penetrate the depths of your

15
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,520
spiritual life and you'll find it uh with this Stone and the person hands

16
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,960
hands you a little stone that you can easily hold in your hand but there's no

17
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,479
more instructions and uh and your freedom is

18
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:04,759
found uh through this Stone and so you spend a years studying the stone

19
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:11,200
analyzing the stones boring into the stones with the drill trying to find out what is about the the stone that's going

20
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,160
to bring you freedom and then finally you go back to the person say I'm not finding anything

21
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,319
you explain what you've done and maybe the person laughs or cries or no no you

22
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:30,920
misunderstood it's not the stone itself it's how you hold the stone

23
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:37,640
that's where your freedom is found if you are bearing down on it if

24
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:44,879
you're intensely straining to understand it to analyze it to figure it out if you're looking Beyond yourself at the

25
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,400
stone you're not going to find your freedom but if you look at the manner

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,400
which you are holding it and seeing it and being with it and knowing it that is

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,200
where the freedom is found and I could have given you the person says you know anything it could have been piece of

28
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:10,720
wood or piece of paper or and it doesn't matter what it is it all is a means to Freedom if you

29
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:18,319
understand that it's in how you are with it that's important so for this meditation then

30
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:25,239
I'd like to encourage you to those moments where you feel like you

31
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:31,599
can really see clearly or know clearly this is is what's happening now whether

32
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:38,280
it's an in breath and an out breath or knowing you're thinking or knowing there's a feeling or knowing there's a

33
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:45,879
sensation knowing there's a reaction whatever it is that you know a sound that you hear doesn't

34
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:52,840
matter whatever it is you know uh see if you can discover how to

35
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:00,480
know it how to be aware of it how to see it so there's an ease or a peace or

36
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,000
Freedom a spaciousness an openness a

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,120
lightness in the knowing and if there's none of those things then U let let your yourself

38
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,680
really see the strain or the heaviness or the stress or the tightness in how

39
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:28,320
you know in how you're trying to see or understand and hold that gently just

40
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,240
allow that to be in the field of awareness not as anything that's wrong

41
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:42,039
or to be fixed but one more thing to discover how to be free with what you

42
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:50,120
know so hopefully this is clear enough so to assume a meditation

43
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,039
posture and there are many postures for meditation the Buddha listed

44
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:02,600
for standing once you start walking

45
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,880
standing sitting and lying down and different mornings different

46
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,759
ones of them these might be most relevant for

47
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,800
you and lowering your gaze before you close your eyes maybe

48
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,639
lower your gaze and see if the you can have a relaxed

49
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,918
gaze maybe not looking at anything in particular soft

50
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,360
eyes and then closing your

51
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
eyes

52
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,400
and so that the how you're

53
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:06,280
aware can be more relaxed at ease it helps to put the body at

54
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:13,800
ease and one way to do this is to take a few slightly deeper breaths than

55
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,720
normal feeling the Torso the rib cage the body as you breathe

56
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:29,720
in and as you exhale to relax the body soften

57
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:40,639
on different exhales you might soften different parts of your body the shoulders the

58
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,919
arms the lower [Music]

59
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,919
back the

60
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,440
belly the lower arms and hands

61
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,280
the

62
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:19,240
legs and then letting the breathing return to

63
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:26,400
normal and with a normal breath on the inhale feel these different parts of the

64
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,520
body that I'll mention and on the exhale exhale soften

65
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,879
relax that part of your

66
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,319
body beginning with the forehead and the

67
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:53,199
eyes softening the forehead and the

68
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,680
eyes the cheeks and the

69
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,639
Jaws the shoulders

70
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,880
the chest and the Heart

71
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,959
area the belly

72
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:20,680
and whatever sense of the global body you have feel that and soften on the exhale

73
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,560
and then feel the thinking mind there's

74
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:43,079
any pressure sagit or

75
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:49,920
tension maybe in the area of the brain or anywhere else associated with

76
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:57,560
thinking as you exhale relax and soften the thinking

77
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,560
mind

78
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,279
and then notice any way in which you're present for this

79
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:31,320
moment any way in which you're mindful

80
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,200
or any way in which you're viewing your present moment

81
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,480
experience on the exhale can you soften and

82
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,639
relax how you're present how you're

83
00:10:51,760 --> 00:11:00,680
aware how you know to continue knowing

84
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,120
continue feeling and sensing your

85
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,320
experience but without any strain pressure

86
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:30,440
tension what we're looking for is found in how we look

87
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,639
moment after a

88
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:55,519

hello and welcome to this third talk on the five qualities of the Dharma

152
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:05,039
and or the five qualities of the Buddhist teachings and one way of understanding

153
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:11,320
these five is there a litmus test to understand what is and isn't the Dharma

154
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:17,080
what is and isn't the Dharma of Liberation the core teachings of the

155
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:23,360
Buddha and for it to be core teachings it needs to have these five qualities it

156
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,440
needs to be something that is directly visible directly known in our experience

157
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,679
it needs to be something which is immediate seen here and

158
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:43,519
now and the third one for today uh there are

159
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:52,080
teachings which are not requiring you to believe not imposing beliefs on you but

160
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:58,799
rather there are teachings that are offered with an invitation to come and see for yourself

161
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,320

I love this kind of the colloquial expression in poly it's not you know a

168
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:49,080
technical you know uh definition of the Dharma it's it's

169
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,880
it's a wonderful kind of soft inviting idea come and study this for yourself

170
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:02,080
learn for yourself find out for yourself if this is true true find out for yourself how this works for you come and

171
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:10,559
look come and investigate and um and uh so whatever teachings you see

172
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,120
you hear you don't have to believe them they're not about believing they're

173
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:22,279
about experimenting they're about trial and errors trying them out and seeing

174
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:28,760
for yourself how do they work and with time how do they work

175
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:36,200
um with um um with supporting

176
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:43,399
you in reducing the suffering of becoming Freer of developing love and

177
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:49,639
compassion kindness how do they support you in developing wholesome qualities so

178
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:58,639
you know for yourself oh this works this is this is good and um so uh there is a

179
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:06,760
uh tremendous emphasis in Buddhism on practice more than

180
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:12,638
belief the the teachings are just enough hopefully just enough instructions to

181
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:18,560
try something out to engage in them uh being a a nightstand Buddhist is may be

182
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:26,358
a fine thing to be but uh that's not what the teachings are for the teachings

183
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:31,760
are for us to put him into to practice and find find out for ourselves and in a

184
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,320
sense to become our own teachers so that uh uh we are finding

185
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:43,720
our own path our own way with these teachings and one of the things that can

186
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,800
be really helpful in this regard is what I taught in this most recent

187
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,118
meditation and that is that um when we're looking investigating how this

188
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:59,200
works what's going on that the investigation is deeply

189
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,200
personal uh it's not an analysis it's not a logical figuring things out but

190
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:13,119
rather it's a discovery of how we are as we practice how we are as we go

191
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:20,720
through our lives what are we contributing what are we bringing with us so if there's a tremendous challenge

192
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:27,040
in the world it might be easy to want to be upset and complain or criticize or

193
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:33,240
blame or uh try to change the world and that sometimes certainly those things

194
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:38,920
might be appropriate but that's not where the Dharma is found if what we're

195
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:45,440
interested in is the Dharma we always ask how how am I in regard to this how

196
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,760
do I find my freedom in regard to this how do I find myself not stuck in it or

197
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,319
reactive to it there still might be a called to do and change something in the world

198
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:04,000
but uh but the Dharma practice is about first maybe not first but the Dharma

199
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,160
practice is always about here how am I and so one way to think of

200
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,680
this is that um the freedom we're looking in looking for in

201
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:23,839
Buddhism is found in how we're looking that uh how we know how we're

202
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:30,760
aware how we practice this is how we're relating to anything that's going on

203
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:37,319
that is the key that's where we F come and see come and see in yourself in how

204
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:44,720
you are in relationship to yourself in relationship to the world in relationship to what's happening and not

205
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:50,480
a few people take on the Dharma uh without being really careful

206
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:57,760
about how they relate to the teachings and to the practices and there can be a lot of striving a lot of judging a a lot

207
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,520
of conceit that comes along with doing the practice there can be the the

208
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:10,240
problem of perfectionism I have to do it right and perfect I can't make a mistake there's a holding on to it for de life

209
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,160
like I have to kind of get an A or I have to you know Advance further than

210
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,200
anyone else in my neighborhood in my block the how is not looked at because

211
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:28,560
we're so the how propels us into the future propels

212
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,200
us into what we're trying to what we want what we're projecting onto the

213
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:40,160
world what our need is what our desire is that we don't see the desire we don't see the

214
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,480
motivation and so part of the purpose of mindfulness is to settle back enough

215
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,560
that we can see how we are we're not rushing ahead uh being

216
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,040
ahead of ourselves but we're settling back in being in ourselves

217
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:04,520
being here fully enough to track and see how am I in the activity that I'm

218
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:12,640
doing am I being mindful am I being relaxed am I being at ease am I being

219
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:19,720
free or am I straining or tense or pushing or caught in desire or caught in

220
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,440
ill will and there are plenty of times we'll discover that we

221
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,240
are that's not the problem in and of itself the problem is when we

222
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:37,160
give into those and participating in those but having them occur is one more

223
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:42,720
occasion to then ask well how do I relate to this now is there a healthier

224
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,359
way of relating to strain and desire and ill will and the healthy way of relating

225
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:55,480
is to see it clearly without strain see it again without see the strain without

226
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:02,560
strain see the ill will without ill will see the desire without desire for it to

227
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,240
go away there's something about seeing what is UNH

228
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:15,040
wholesome that makes room for the wholesome to grow what's good in us

229
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,880
flourishes so how we are and so in that last meditation I the beginning I gave

230
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:28,880
an analogy which I like to do again for those of who didn't hear it that maybe the the similar analogy

231
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:35,000
kind of uh will bring more clarity to what I'm

232
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,079
trying to teach here that there's this imaginary teacher

233
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,280
out there who is very famous for uh really helping

234
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,720
people and uh so many people travel to this teacher and uh and they explain

235
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:57,000
their difficulties and the teacher then uh goes into the back room and comes

236
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:04,960
back and offers everyone a a small Stone and says here with this Stone

237
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:12,040
you'll discover how to you you'll discover your freedom and um and so most people are

238
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:19,079
confused they thought they would get a teaching some piece of wisdom but just to be given a stone in the exercise that

239
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:24,119
with this Stone you'll find your your freedom but some people take it

240
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:30,000
seriously and Trust the teacher and and uh but they're think that the answer is

241
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,960
going to be in the stone and they study geology and they study the Rock and they

242
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,319
look at it and measure it and weigh it and maybe even crack it open or maybe

243
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:47,400
wor holes in it and get it chemically analyzed and uh do all kinds of things

244
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:53,280
to the stone and after many years of kind of trying to figure out what the stone has

245
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:01,359
to teach they go back to the teacher and she no no you misunder tood the answer is not in the

246
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:07,040
stone how you the freedom is found in how you hold the

247
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:15,680
stone don't strain don't push it don't St don't bang on it don't bore into it

248
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:21,280
don't shake it to get the answers just hold it lightly and freely in your

249
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,680
palm no need to cling to it just hold it and discover that in the light handed

250
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:34,240
holding holding something lightly that is where the freedom is freedom is not

251
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,800
in trying to get something out of the stone and

252
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:45,319
um and uh the um and it's how you hold

253
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:51,800
it and the teacher might have said I could have given you anything at all it could have been a piece of paper a stick

254
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,440
anything and it doesn't matter what I gave you give you it matters if you conf

255
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,280
uh discover how you're with the the object it's with the how that you'll

256
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,440
find your freedom so

257
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:16,040
um Liberation is not found in something in some belief in something

258
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:22,040
external but Liberation is found in how we seek

259
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,319
Liberation freedom is found in how we're looking for it

260
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:33,119
so we don't seek it with tension we don't look for it with strain we don't

261
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:40,359
look and feel and sense and know our experience with fear and dread or

262
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:48,240
resistance or aversion we discover how to uh be

263
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:56,240
free and so in this way the Dharma uh is pointing to your own

264
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:04,000
experience saying come and see come and see for yourself in your own experience how this

265
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:13,800
works the Dharma is visible here and now it is immediate it's right here and

266
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,960
