1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,918
so

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,960
warm greetings i'm very happy to be back here at the

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,960
here in california the 7am sitting with you all it was very nice to have my friends uh

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,720
paul and phu uh uh uh lead these sittings and the

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,719
talks and i i was i participated i was here with you all participating and listening to them as

6
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,840
well and enjoyed them quite a bit and i'm also very happy to be back in

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,360
this way with you all they somehow trying to think of a theme

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,480
for this week i felt that i didn't want to jump right back

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,039
in with kind of a similar dharma kind of orientation way of

10
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,520
teaching that i've done much of this last year because of the way that my friends were teaching you know kind of had

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,000
felt like a both maybe to respect them and and um and not to have too abrupt kind

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,159
of a change so what i thought of doing is to tell you stories uh during the 7th

13
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:25,360
and 30th time so i'll say this again afterwards but um this mark's a little different for this

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,600
week and in doing the guided meditation today

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:39,520
brief words i'll say i want to say something maybe that's a little bit provocative that maybe points to

16
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,640
something and maybe will support you to take maybe a leap of faith into

17
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:54,159
uh giving yourself over to the simplicity of the meditation

18
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,600
so i like the word sacrifice not for some of its connotations it has

19
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,560
in english but rather because of its latin root that it comes from the latin

20
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,360
root to make sacred and and so with that in mind and the common

21
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,040
english definition of giving something up um one of the things we're doing in

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:26,879
meditation is sacrificing ourselves for ourselves and

23
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,080
uh or sacrificing one part of ourselves for another part

24
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:39,280
and we're sacrificing making something sacred by at least temporarily letting go of the

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,280
constructed self letting go of the self that's built up from stories and ideas and

26
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:54,160
desires and aversions and a self that's been created or built up from its hurts and its joys and

27
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:03,120
and its fears and its conceits not to dismiss that or deny it

28
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,640
but rather for now for the next you know 30 minutes just to sacrifice it

29
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,599
for yourself for that part of yourself that is unlimited that's not defined by stories not but

30
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,799
not preoccupied with what's in the future or what's in the past or with fantasy or

31
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:31,040
with uh defending oneself building oneself up uh even preoccupied with healing oneself

32
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:39,440
or fixing oneself or all this stuff but the self that is free the self that breathes easily

33
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:46,799
the self that just can be here in a very contented deep full

34
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,400
peaceful way we're sacrificing ourselves for that self

35
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,280
for these minutes so

36
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,720
to enter into and

37
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,840
enter into a meditation posture that's suitable for

38
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:21,199
you and to gently close your eyes

39
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,360
and to make a transition from the usual way that you are involved in

40
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,720
yourself to a different way you might take a few

41
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:43,840
long slow deep breaths breathing in deeply

42
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:52,960
and as you exhale imagine that you're letting go of everything everything but

43
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:03,360
sitting here in your body breathing in deeply and as you exhale

44
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,840
letting go into your body

45
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,520
exhaling and relaxing your body

46
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,320
and then to let your breathing return to normal

47
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:38,759
and this process of making sacred sacrificing is represented by

48
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,720
sacrificing the tension we hold in our body

49
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,840
sacrificing not so much as

50
00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:02,080
having aversion to something pushing it away but making sacred

51
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,880
by relaxing the unnecessary tension we hold in our body

52
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,638
so you might begin by softening around the eyes and the

53
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
forehead

54
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:49,840
relaxing the muscles of the face

55
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,440
as you're exhaling softening the shoulders

56
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:03,120
and this relaxation this is a sacrifice that's worth making

57
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:10,800
to sacrifice the tense being the tense body for a body that's

58
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,840
more relaxed

59
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,160
softening relaxing in the chest

60
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:45,520
maybe at the end of the exhale the front ribcage can relax a bit more

61
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:59,599
and relaxing the belly

62
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,879
and also maybe there's a global relaxation you can do throughout your

63
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:13,840
body a global sacrifice

64
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,919
of tension contraction holding resistance

65
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:29,120
that you willingly offer out as a way of making sacred

66
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,479
sacrificing to feel the body

67
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,839
more at ease

68
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:55,839
to feel the living experience the lived body from the inside out

69
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:08,320
and then within this body this part of this body

70
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:23,839
to begin to feel and sense your breathing

71
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,560
and as you exhale to let go of your thoughts

72
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,600
your ideas your fantasies your plans

73
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,920
your past for these minutes let that be

74
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:55,360
sacrificed for the way that mindfulness of breathing

75
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:08,480
brings you into the non-constructed self

76
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:19,839
the self that is not limited by any of the ideas and stories

77
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:33,839
the simplicity of being here breathing in and breathing out

78
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:46,519
and perhaps lovingly maybe with a kind of a love for this

79
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,920
unconstructed self

80
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,920
you can let go of all the ideas and thoughts

81
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,760
willingly sacrifice it for something that's better

82
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,079
that which is not a story or conceit

83
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:20,480
a thought that which opens up

84
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,839
in the simplicity of breathing in and breathing out mindfully

85
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:45,919
perhaps it's worthwhile to let go what you gain is so much greater

86
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:57,840
than what you're holding on to

87
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,440
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

88
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:33,278
one of the great treasures of the sacrifice i'm talking about today

89
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:40,440
is that there is when we let go of the small self the constructed self the

90
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:48,398
preoccupations of the mind about the past and the future and fantasy

91
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:59,840
one treasure there is that there is a natural perhaps simple

92
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:10,000
care for other people a simple opening of our awareness

93
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,960
to include the humanity of others

94
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,360
a kind of awareness and way of thinking about people and feeling sensing people being aware

95
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:32,559
of them where a simplest form of care can arise

96
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:41,840
simplest form of appreciation of friendliness of kindness

97
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:49,200
one that doesn't have to be known by others or be put into action

98
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,840
necessarily but just a simple

99
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,960
simple kindness

100
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,760
and if such a thing or something seemingly related to that

101
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,799
that's your way that is available to you at the end of a

102
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:24,240
meditation session one way to continue

103
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:32,158
the sacred sacrifice of letting go of the small self

104
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:41,840
and giving room for something else is to spend a few moments with thoughts

105
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:51,200
and feelings and attitudes of well-wishing for others

106
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,760
may it be that others may be happy

107
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:05,840
may it be that others feel safe

108
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:14,080
may it be that others are peaceful

109
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,480
may it be that others are free

110
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:29,120
may it be that whatever whatever's well-being i experience that

111
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,639
you experience from meditation

112
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:41,360
may that well-being be shared with others

113
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:51,039
may our we live our life caring kindly

114
00:31:51,039 --> 00:32:01,840
for all living beings may all beings be happy

115
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:09,279
so good morning and good day to all of you and i think i see now that

116
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:14,480
we're coming into that time of the year where we have a light show

117
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,480
and then buddha looks like he's disappearing in the shadows for a while and probably i will too and

118
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,440
maybe if i remember tomorrow i'll put up try to put up another light in here that maybe

119
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,200
helps you to see better but also i don't want to

120
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,919
to take away this wonderful light show that happens on the wall this

121
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,480
time of year

122
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:50,399
so i want to start by expressing my gratitude to

123
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:58,320
my friends paul heller and phu schrader for teaching this last two weeks and i was with you all during that time

124
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:05,519
i was also meditating and listening to them and delighted and really happy to listen to

125
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,878
their wonderful teachings and and uh and that their teachings and also these

126
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,079
uh their want their own wonderfulness they're these years of practice that's so palpable in them

127
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,118
that um that you got to they got to share themselves with you

128
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,598
and you got to meet them and

129
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:33,200
and partly because of the because of what happened the last two or three weeks i feel a little bit

130
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:41,440
hesitant to just kind of jump in and offer some new teachings that are um you know in the kind of mode that

131
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:49,839
i've usually been doing this last year and so i thought that um

132
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:56,638
um that may be a nice transition from that time is for me to tell some stories

133
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:03,040
and some buddhist stories and um number four in particular who was very

134
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,680
fond of stories and there is some theory uh in this field of religious studies

135
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,119
that um for most religions stories are more important than doctrine

136
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:23,680
that at least for most people the stories of the religion is what they kind of take in and evoke their imagination and

137
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:31,280
provide examples of how to live their lives and guidance for how to live so so you know i don't know how true it

138
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,680
is universally but it's an interesting theory and and certainly stories are important

139
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:44,960
so the first the story i want to tell today is um one that maybe is

140
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,960
a bit poignant for california these days where we have a lot of wildfires and already

141
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:57,200
we have more wildfires so early in the season than we did last year so we'll see what happens the rest

142
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:05,359
of the year but wildfires so in in the time in the ancient world in india this is a

143
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:11,680
jataka tale that the tales are kind of like aesop's fable

144
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,000
with having to do with animals usually and many of them and the animals uh

145
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,160
there's one main character in the in these stories that turns out to have been the buddha

146
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,560
in a previous life and so kind of he may be developing the virtue developing himself to be

147
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:38,160
to become the buddha and sometimes in the future so this story involves a parrot

148
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:45,520
and and a great forest fire that sweeps through the jungle and uh

149
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:52,400
as a bird the bird can relatively easily outfly the fire and come to safety

150
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,480
but as this little parrot is flying away he sees that underneath him all these animals are

151
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:05,839
running through the forest to get away from the um you know the approaching fire however

152
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,960
they're coming up against a great lake and it looks like they're going to be trapped against the lake and many of

153
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,560
these animals can't swim and so they're stuck between

154
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:23,760
the approaching fire and being burned or the lake where they would drown

155
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:31,200
so the little parrot said i have to do something i can't just let this continue the way it is so the

156
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:37,280
the um the parrot uh dives into the lake to make its little wings

157
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:44,320
wet and then flies over the hottest part of the fire and sprinkles its uh flaps its wings and

158
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,079
sprinkles a little water drops of water it has onto the fire and it does that over and over again

159
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,680
back and forth back and forth and it doesn't really make any difference on the fire there's a few

160
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:03,760
drops that are coming down they probably evaporate before they even hit the fire but the parrot keeps doing it

161
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:09,440
because of the paris great dedication and great sacrifice and virtue

162
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,760
they it has an impact in the unseen world of ancient india

163
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,920
and that is the great uh god brahma uh or the great kind of rule kind of

164
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,599
like the zeus of the pantheon of ancient indian gods the great god brahma or sakka

165
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,040
depending how it's named um

166
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:39,680
his throne heats up and apparently that's a phenomena in the unseen world that when someone on the

167
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,680
earth is being very virtuous he heats up the throne of the great god so he decides to come

168
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:52,640
down to see what's going on and do so he turns himself into a great eagle and he flies down and he sees this

169
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:59,119
little parrot that is uh what the parrot's trying to do and he flies next to the parrot and said you

170
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,240
know this is ridiculous it doesn't make any sense for you to be doing what you're doing

171
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,760
because no matter how many times you drop some drops of water onto the fire you're not going to

172
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:16,240
extinguish it you're not going to save your friends and this is not going gonna you can't this doesn't make any sense what you're doing

173
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,520
and the parrot flying next to the eagle says you know flying back to get more water

174
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,880
says um uh if not me then who

175
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,680
and uh and maybe if i keep doing it i don't know what the consequences are i don't know

176
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:41,119
where the what will happen but this is what i have to do and this moved to the great god

177
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:49,119
tremendously and to see this steadfastness this courage this this dedication

178
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:55,920
to be of help to others no matter how seemingly pointless it is inspired by

179
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:04,560
this uh the great god uh created a great rainstorm and a massive

180
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,319
rainstorm that very quickly uh put out the fire and saved all the

181
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:15,839
animals and then the parrot said yes you see you

182
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,920
never quite know i couldn't quite know what effect my efforts were going to make

183
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,960
but you see they worked so um so this idea of what i like this

184
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:39,200
story i like this story about a lot is that um for me the naturalness of which the the um

185
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:46,000
the naturalness of the parrots helping others that uh his whole being was dedicated to

186
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,079
doing this and i liken it to a parental care some parents would do the same for their

187
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,480
child they would do whatever it took they would sacrifice themselves for the life of their child

188
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,680
and and there's something kind of i kind of think almost natural

189
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:09,119
that parents care for their kids and you see that in the natural world as

190
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,880
well that so many mammals animals care for their young

191
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,880
and sometimes that a tremendous sacrifice dedication willingness to die for their little kids

192
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:29,280
if necessary and to protect them from predators or anything else and in this kind of parental dedication

193
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,960
care exactly what this nature of that care or that love or that

194
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,480
devotion is i don't know but it does feel

195
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:46,000
in when it occurs uh it doesn't have to always occur but when it occurs

196
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,040
that kind of a naturalness to it and so this parrot was just simply

197
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,240
acting on natural instincts acting on a natural good heart

198
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,920
that was not limited by the small sense of self that's constructed about me

199
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:08,560
myself and mine and what's in it for me and and will people like me if i do it will i be praised well

200
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:14,800
or maybe i have to do this because then i'll avoid avoid condemnation people won't think bad of me that i ran

201
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:21,440
off and abandoned my friends and all these kinds of uh calculations concerns of self that

202
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,119
are a contraction a constriction a limiting factor to how people live their lives

203
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:33,200
all the stories we live in and both imagine stories stories stories that predict the future

204
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:39,839
what this all means but when all those can fall away which is part of the function of meditation

205
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,880
then we tap into something very different a very different orientation a very

206
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:51,599
different set of values a very different way of being in the world that's not boxed in or limited

207
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:58,240
by conceit and stories and ideas or should and shouldn't even ideas of obligation and what we're

208
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:04,560
supposed to do so the parent the the parrot was not trying was not living under

209
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:11,119
uh some duty-bound rule that is supposed to save all these other beings but i think of it

210
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:18,160
as just natural movement of the good heart and uh and then we don't know what the

211
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:25,280
unseen world will do we don't know what the effects are going to be the impact we have and um

212
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,960
the and sometimes some people do a small act and it has a huge impact

213
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,960
and it changes the world the woman who filmed the teenager 17

214
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,960
year old who filmed george floyd's death a murder

215
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,000
she had no idea that she was doing anything but trying to record and have justice by

216
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,160
having a record of what she saw but she what her little action had a huge impact on

217
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:00,960
on the nation and the world and um and so we never know and maybe we

218
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,000
shouldn't know the impact we have and i'll end with one more little story that

219
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:14,000
um comes from the sufi tradition there was a a genie

220
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:22,160
who came to a sufi and said i will grant you um two wishes

221
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:29,520
and what would those wishes be and you can have anything you want and the sufi says wherever i go

222
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:36,079
i want to benefit people but i don't want to know that i'm doing it

223
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:43,200
and so the genie gave the the sufi a big bag to carry

224
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,440
and that's a special bag that had seeds of all kinds of wonderful beneficial plants

225
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:56,559
and had a little hole in the back so it was constantly but as the as a sufi was carrying it

226
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:03,440
and walking along the seeds would fall out of that backpack onto the ground and

227
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,839
sprout and create new plants but because it was always happening behind the sufi this

228
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:15,200
was always traveling on the sufi never got to know the way which was benefiting all the

229
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,560
people behind it through growing plants and food and forests and trees

230
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:26,240
and whatever it was so who knows what the unseen world

231
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,160
responds to our goodness in our care that comes not from obligation but comes

232
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:37,280
from the awakened goodness in our own hearts

233
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:47,839
may we all be parrots thank you
