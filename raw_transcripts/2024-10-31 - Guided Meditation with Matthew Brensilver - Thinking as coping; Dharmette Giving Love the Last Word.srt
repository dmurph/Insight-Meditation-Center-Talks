1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:13,000
so uh so welcome folks good to uh good to be with you this evening

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,080
evening here in Berkeley

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,439
um yeah all right let's uh let's do that

4
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:31,679
thing that we do find uh

5
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,960
yeah maybe maybe take a little extra time to get into your posture whatever posture that is just get

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,039
uh feel good as good as bodies can

7
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,440
feel in a

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,960
posture e

9
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,078
and we're not just sitting

10
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,200
here we're in a in a

11
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:08,840
lineage kind of continuation of wisdom and love started long long ago

12
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,680
we don't have to invent wisdom or

13
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,879
love just T take our cues from the momentum of the

14
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Dharma

15
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,760
e e

16
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,360
just let your whole

17
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,720
body settle e

18
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,320
give your blessing to every

19
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:22,440
imperfection there are always a thousand things right and a

20
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,759
thousand wrong we afford ourselves

21
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:35,240
the luxury of not needing to sort all of that

22
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:47,960
out so with a Supple heart we take what's

23
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
offered

24
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,560
e e

25
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,560
the less safe we feel more unprotected we

26
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:28,199
feel the more urgent and sticky our thinking becomes

27
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,599
so we relax our body relax our mind and attempt

28
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:54,360
to reassure ourselves our

29
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,800
system that right now it's safe

30
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,400
enough to let

31
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,120
go to fall into the

32
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
present

33
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

34
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

35
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

36
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

37
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
e e

38
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,360
h maybe uh we can say that all thinking is

39
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,399
coping coping with uh some

40
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:21,519
s coping with the intensity of being an

41
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:27,519
animal sentient vulnerable

42
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:53,600
but we practice knowing Pleasant is pleasant

43
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,199
and unpleasant simply as unpleasant

44
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:14,040
we practice listening to the alarm bells that go off in our

45
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:22,720
body but not over interpreting them

46
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:36,839
not reading them as alarm Bells but simply as

47
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:54,720
unpleasant a kind of sense of safety and seclusion

48
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:03,480
grows and there's less need to elaborate our

49
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:12,839
life to conduct our ritualistic safety behaviors checking on

50
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,759
this and that

51
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:55,360
we deepen our Peace by making peace making

52
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,040
peace with imperfection

53
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

54
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

55
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

56
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

57
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

58
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

59
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

60
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

61
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
e e

62
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:35,759
uh our thinking is so uh so

63
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:44,080
innocent how can we blame something that's been conserved

64
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,080
across eons of evolutionary time

65
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,440
but the silence beckons

66
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:20,158
us welcomes you with open arms

67
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,679
Just As You

68
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Are

69
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

70
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

71
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

72
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

73
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

74
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

75
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

76
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

77
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

78
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

79
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

80
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

81
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
e e

82
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,080
e

83
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:13,559
okay it's good to uh good to sit with

84
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,240
you so uh Agnes card uh

85
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:28,240
quoted not so long ago um she says when you're feverish you're

86
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:34,679
not healthy and that you cannot engage in your normal productive function

87
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:41,080
something's wrong with you your body's arai fever is a form of

88
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:47,760
sickness but a fever is also a healthy immune response to the presence uh in

89
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,200
your body of some kind of infection if I lost my susceptibility

90
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:00,600
for fever that would be a sign that things had gone very

91
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:07,960
wrong it would be a way of getting sicker not healthier so while it is clearly not

92
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:14,000
quote best to be weak feverish sleepy and

93
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:24,840
incapacitated it might nonetheless be the best option on the table a fever is a healthy way of being

94
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:31,518
sick I have much the same view about

95
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,880
anger fever is a healthy way of being sick and the argument here is that

96
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:43,360
anger you could say is a healthy way of being

97
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,639
sick a healthy recognition that something of

98
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:55,200
value is under threat

99
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,240
and yeah I have of a

100
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:10,120
fever anger anger um is not Health it's not balance right

101
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:15,440
a fever is not Health but nevertheless a sign that our

102
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:22,080
body is trying to return to balance and

103
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,159
so uh I begin in this way just to to

104
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:33,240
note yet okay in me some fear some

105
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:42,320
anger and the anger and fear is set against a

106
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:52,519
much larger backdrop of love and anger may be a kind of um

107
00:32:52,519 --> 00:33:01,360
important first word but anger can never be the last word a fever

108
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,440
in other words is not meant to keep you

109
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:13,440
feverish and if we truly care about

110
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:21,080
suffering we give love the last

111
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:30,200
word if we've seen deeply enough into Patia Samu conditionality this is

112
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,440
because that is or that was this is because that

113
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:44,799
was if we see that clearly enough we give love the last

114
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:52,279
word if we've known fearlessness the jewel of

115
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:57,919
mindfulness we give love the last word

116
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:05,440
in the penumbra of cessation of

117
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,320
release not even um a trace of fight

118
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:19,000
left just peace we give love the last

119
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:26,280
word and in times of of hate um we

120
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,839
become even more acutely sensitized to

121
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:39,599
love when you touch into love you know the tears shed

122
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:47,679
testify to a kind of heart longing you know the pain bound up in

123
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:54,398
fear and hate and helplessness and so the tears they

124
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:02,280
they're like a kind of emanation of our own longing to move back towards love to

125
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,240
move towards Health the fever to

126
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:16,200
break and so I I will not tell you how to love but merely note its

127
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:24,599
necessity the the question how how should I love that that um that never

128
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:30,000
gets answered that never gets answered the people who think they've answered

129
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,680
that question stop growing spiritually

130
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:45,359
ethically how do I love that is not a question it's a

131
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:54,319
Coan aito uh domination talking about

132
00:35:54,319 --> 00:36:01,680
domination so not love uh domination is in fact the thing that

133
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:08,720
needs to be fixed it's based on an unawakened response to uncertainty and

134
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,920
diversity the ignorant chitta heart mind reacts by demanding hard and permanent

135
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:21,839
Solutions fixed boundaries and simple strategies that will defend it against changing

136
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,079
conditions that it can never control cultivate investigate purify and

137
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:35,400
release the chitta from self view has to be the starting point when you enter your true territory

138
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:42,119
the domain of heart Consciousness you get the message in your intimate territory

139
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:47,440
control and domination don't work you can't even control your thoughts and

140
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:54,359
emotions you don't even own this body here there are no hard borders

141
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:59,800
everything permeates you from the air you breathe to the memories that well up in your

142
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:05,040
mind you have to cooperate forgive and allow inner

143
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,800
changes that defy your identity you learn to give up craving

144
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,400
for simplistic Solutions and fixed positions instead there can be an

145
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:24,000
acceptance of life's uncertainties and frustrations rather than feeling threatened by them as we stop projecting

146
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,520
our personal failings and dissatisfactions outward we see otherness as a basis for increased

147
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,400
understanding and even wonder a love based on the Miracle of sharing life

148
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:44,040
gets born and a relationship based on Harmony rather than

149
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:50,160
coercion the great Conquest then is over self view this has always been the

150
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,800
teaching of the way of the supremely awakened ones

151
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:05,920
an un awakened response to uncertainty

152
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,640
diversity We Want U predictability understandable we want

153
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:19,520
the known but there's uh so much aliveness

154
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:27,880
in not knowing in newness n said that um truth is a

155
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:34,520
portion to one according to their strength and maybe we say wisdom is a

156
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:41,839
portion to one according to their comfort with not

157
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,640
knowing in your intimate territory Aang goes on

158
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,880
to control and domination don't

159
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:02,440
work don't work uh we have to discover that a million times

160
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,880
on our

161
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:18,240
cushion when we start to release the territory we call I me

162
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:25,920
mine is it its own kind of claim of ownership and control and

163
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:32,760
Dominion but

164
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,480
um that doesn't work it's an

165
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,640
illusion we release the territory we call I Me Mine my country my country I'm

166
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:50,440
a US citizen well yeah country is not

167
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,480
self empty my home my Earth even Earth

168
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:03,960
not self the world trembles in all directions the Buddha

169
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,960
says we have to take in the implications of

170
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:17,119
that and knowing that brings some relief maybe a

171
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:25,359
lot and all the suffering still matters it's not blotted out but it matters in a

172
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:32,800
