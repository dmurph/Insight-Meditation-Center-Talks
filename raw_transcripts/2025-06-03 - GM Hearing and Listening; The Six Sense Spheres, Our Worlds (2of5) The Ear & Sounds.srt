00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:21,520
Okay So today is uh uh the second day of my week subbing

8
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:30,319
for Gil who's teaching a retreat at IRC and I'm very happy to be here with everyone this uh 700 a.m as we call it

9
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,160
since it's 7 a.m Pacific time uh the 7 a.m Sanga is just uh it's such a

10
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,280
delightful part of the whole IMC world you know it's come to be uh very

11
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,560
important you know in uh in our world our world our dharma

12
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,879
world so I'll carry on from uh from yesterday where I introduced the theme

13
00:02:52,879 --> 00:03:00,160
of what is just defined uh in the sutas as the world the world which is that in

14
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:09,120
the world by which we perceive and conceive leave the world So these six sense spheres the

15
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,360
eyes and what is seen ears and sounds nose and what is smelled the tongue and

16
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,200
what is tasted the body and what is sensed tactally and the mind with all

17
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:29,120
its activities its mind objects And the relationship between

18
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:37,040
what comes to us through our physical senses all our interactions with the world that is and what we make of what

19
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,000
comes in the mental activity that arises conditioned on those uh six sense uh

20
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,959
sense senses on all that contact through those six senses That's the ground where we

21
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,319
find freedom It is our world and our freedom is found in that

22
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:04,560
world and so are the obstacles to that freedom And that's kind of what I'm focusing on this week The the sense

23
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,760
spaces in the the what arises in relation to the sense spaces that creates obstacles to clear seeing and

24
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,840
the insight that can arise as a result of clear seeing

25
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:25,199
So our experience of the whole world comes to us through these five physical senses and the mind and uh and of course

26
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:33,280
the mind is considered a sense in the in the Buddhist uh traditions There is no world outside of

27
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,680
what we sense You know that's it's maybe it's obvious but I I don't

28
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,360
think we really think of it that way And then uh the ma mind uh attempts to make

29
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,199
sense of it to create a concept of it many concepts of it all based on what

30
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,880
comes in through these physical senses the conditioned interactions of all of

31
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,520
these those make up our experience of the world of our

32
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,280
lives So there is a there is a suta in the the samuta nikaya one of the um

33
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,280
collections of discourses of the Buddha the connected discourses it's called the saba suta

34
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,600
which means the all the teaching on the all saba is all everything and the all

35
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,680
just like the world is according to uh the Buddha in the suta the six senses

36
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,560
and their objects and remember the the Buddha said that we can't reach the end of suffering

37
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,520
unless we reach the end of the world Just a slightly curious statement I

38
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:49,400
think I hope it'll be uh you know uh responded to in uh during this

39
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,840
week So my intention is to encourage inquiry to encourage investigation uh

40
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,320
into how we relate to each of these spheres of uh of our experience of life

41
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,240
And yesterday I spoke a bit about the first sense in this list the sense of

42
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:16,039
seeing sight and today the focus will be on on hearing Um but first let's

43
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:23,720
uh let's sit let's meditate So if

44
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:31,479
you'll take your uh useful upright meditation posture upright uh

45
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:37,400
metaphorically so even if you're lying down you can have that sense of uprightness in

46
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:45,840
the in the spine I think especially the kind of uh sense of dignity that can be

47
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,120
uh that can be felt when there is

48
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,840
uprightness along with ease along with letting go of any tension any kind of

49
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:08,080
muscular activity that isn't necessary in order to keep us

50
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:26,000
upright And as we usually do uh maybe a brief body scan

51
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:36,000
just touching with our awareness areas of uh of tension in the

52
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:47,240
body Breathing into them and then on the exhale just letting them ease up

53
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,240
We all have our own areas that that we habitually carry

54
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:08,199
tension Maybe in the face or throat shoulders the chest the gut belly

55
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,199
Just breathing into the any kind of tight places any kind of

56
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:27,120
places that feel constricted and letting them ease

57
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,800
up Might let your breath be a little bit deeper as you do this

58
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:48,560
really allow the sensations of breathing to uh to help with the easing the calming

59
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,080
of tensions in the

60
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:05,640
body For most of us the breath can have that can have that

61
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,200
effect calming settling

62
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,240
and letting your breathing be just happening as at its normal rhythm

63
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,760
whatever that happens to be right now

64
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:53,480
And letting your attention your awareness be with with the breathing for a little bit

65
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,519
And now just uh letting your uh letting your awareness be receptive to

66
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:59,120
sound Noticing the sounds that arise Sound of my voice

67
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:09,760
It sounds where you are wherever you are inside the building you're inside

68
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,120
Maybe sounds coming from

69
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:24,399
outside The sound of your own breathing If you can hear

70
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:36,519
that sounds coming from within the body other sounds besides the breathing

71
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:15,920
And just as uh we can see what is uh what's present um around us if our eyes

72
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,920
are opening and functioning well we can also hear if our ears are working

73
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,440
well working well enough maybe with the help of hearing aids

74
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,760
It's true for a lot of older

75
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:41,440
folks We don't need to reach out in order to hear It happens naturally when

76
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,560
a sound arises This

77
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,240
So as uh as sounds arise just notice them and let them be

78
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,120
here he heard And uh and also notice if the initial

79
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:39,000
hearing leads to an urge to uh actively

80
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,480
listen to uh to try to hear It's normal of

81
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,800
course especially if a sound is new or unusual

82
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,959
But if you find yourself leaning into into hearing trying to hear something

83
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,480
trying to identify what's making the sound or what the sound might

84
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:17,519
mean just notice the effect of that in uh in your body Notice if there's any tension that

85
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:24,279
arises sense of constriction tightness anywhere

86
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,600
And in your mind as well

87
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:23,090
And as much as possible just just let hearing happen without leaning

88
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:30,440
[Music] forward without the mind getting involved in conceiving

89
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,320
ideas about what you're hearing

90
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,880
Just rest in that way

91
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,199
Receptive awake

92
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:08,519
alert but not grasping at sound Grasping at meaning about sound

93
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,600
If you're aware of any uh any tension that's arising due to due to uh

94
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,440
attending to hearing some subtle way that uh that the

95
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,720
mind is um tightening up around uh trying to

96
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:33,039
here Really good to notice that And if you like it's uh it's fine

97
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:39,200
to let go of attending to hearing and just um rest with your usual way of

98
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:47,120
practicing with the breath or or other object or open awareness Just allowing whatever arises

99
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,520
to be known

100
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:06,880
But if you'd like to continue with just attending to sound as it

101
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:14,000
arises and noticing the effect the body and the

102
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:18,919
mind that can be really useful

103
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:36,159
You know I've heard that I've heard teachers say um I think I've heard Gail say it and

104
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:42,080
others as well that our attention when we're being mindful our attention is a

105
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,760
kind of love And I don't know if you feel that I

106
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:55,799
certainly feel it To give something attention is a kind of love

107
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:02,960
And we can take that uh that attention that love and maybe turn it outward

108
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:11,039
right now towards uh the world the big wide world beyond

109
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:17,480
our own world beyond our senses and our our mind states about

110
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:26,240
them the physical world out there and all the other beings and wish them well

111
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:34,000
Wish them well wherever they are in whatever state they're in May they be

112
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:42,960
safe May all beings be happy May all beings have as much health

113
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:50,679
as is possible to them May all beings have ease in their

114
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:56,320
lives May all beings be free

115
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:26,359
[Music]

116
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,799
So uh welcome

117
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:15,519
again and we'll continue this exploration of the of the sense spaces

118
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:22,039
and their objects There is

119
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:30,000
seen seeing and what is seen There's hearing and what is heard tasting and

120
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,679
what is tasted The rest of them you know between each of the sense organs and

121
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:41,120
what they sense there is a connection There is uh

122
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,120
something that uh that allows that connection to happen And that connection

123
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,279
can be pretty simple um or it can get quite complicated by

124
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:59,279
mental activity and that I'm focusing this week on the kind of mental activity

125
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:06,320
that makes it difficult uh to see with the clarity that's needed for insight to

126
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:13,599
arise You know in the in the text this kind of complication between the uh the seeing

127
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:20,280
and the seeing the hearing and the heard is called a feder fetter f

128
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:26,720
t a fetter that arises dependent on the seeing and what is seen on the hearing

129
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:33,919
and what is heard kind of unh wholesome hook that gets created between each sense

130
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,079
organ and its object that ties us down in a sense that keeps us

131
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:45,280
caught and feder feder is a kind of unusual word in our daily life but I

132
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:53,040
like it it has a lot of use in the in Buddhist world and translations of uh of

133
00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:00,400
the word samojana is the word in in Pali and uh I like this word feder Gil uses

134
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:07,040
the translation not for this word recently not k n o t um which is also

135
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,880
really evocative of what's what's going on I think but I like this word feder

136
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,520
because uh I'm a birder I love birds and feeders

137
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:25,280
are what um what go on a hawk or falcon's foot in order to tie it to its

138
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:32,000
perch in falconry I'm definitely not a falconer like to watch the birds not not

139
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,200
hold them to their perches Um so it's a way a fetter is a

140
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:43,040
way of keeping the bird from flying free and that's what these fedters do to us

141
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:50,240
You know there's a list of 10 fedters that that's quoted often that are defined as uh the obstacles the main

142
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:57,440
obstacles to being liberated But I think uh what's really important to keep in mind is that a

143
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:05,000
feder is any mind state or like desire or ill will resentment pride envy

144
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,440
agitation just trying to make something happen any kind of a mental state or

145
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:16,599
activity that keeps us from being free that ties us down that keeps us looking

146
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:24,200
for stability looking for happiness in all the wrong places kind of in the big

147
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:30,560
picture When no fedters are operating on in us then we're free You know we're

148
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:38,079
liberated in a sense So these sense spheres are the are the

149
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:45,280
um the area where these feeders uh arise and the second of the sense

150
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:51,359
spheres is um the ear the hearing apparatus and the sounds that uh that

151
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:58,079
come to it And I think we're aware of how what we hear can give rise to

152
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,640
fetterss to knots to strong emotions that either keep us tied to the sounds

153
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:13,520
or that uh that uh make us push you know to get away from the sound

154
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,440
I recently very recently received a gift from a a Dharma friend a charming little

155
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:26,640
plastic monk who is sitting and holding a a mala of beads and hitting a a little

156
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,320
wooden gong a Zen style wooden gong and he runs on solar power He's right here

157
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,240
next to me a little visual aid

158
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,560
There he is eating his little gong And he's

159
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:53,599
uh uh because he runs on solar power uh he goes really fast on sunshiny days and

160
00:37:53,599 --> 00:38:00,240
slower on cloudy days It's quite foggy and cloudy right now here And he's sitting on a pile of

161
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:07,040
dharma books that are right you know always right next to me next to a southacing window So he gets all the

162
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,680
sunlight you know that comes through that window And I notice that when the little

163
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,599
guy is going fast really hitting that gong at a rate of like eight or 10 beats

164
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:26,960
per second it's a little bit agitating to my mind I feel like the sound is

165
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,320
pushing me to go faster in whatever task I'm doing on my computer which is

166
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:39,040
usually where I'm sitting And that's not objectively true Of course this little

167
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,720
plastic guy is just responding to the amount of energy that the sun is

168
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,280
producing from the tiny little solar panel that's on the platform he's sitting

169
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:57,839
on But a fetter arises when my ears hear that sound It's a little bit aversive

170
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:03,839
the feeling A very subtle feeling of being pushed unfairly You know there

171
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:10,720
I've just added another layer blaming the monk for that and it's not a big deal of course

172
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:17,440
you know and of course and I have a lot of options to reduce the agitation I can

173
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,400
I can move the little guy out of the sunshine And I can also see if it's

174
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:30,560
possible to just hear the sound without assigning this meaning that arises out

175
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,720
of the aversive hook that has arisen to just rest in the hearing It's just a

176
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,760
ticking sound you know like a clock During the meditation it it

177
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,520
started out um relatively early in the morning here started out the little guy

178
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,359
was was uh tapping the the um the gong

179
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,400
quite slowly and then as it got brighter as the sky got brighter it went a little

180
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:04,320
bit faster and I was able during the meditation to just uh just hear it not

181
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:12,000
really listen in an active way and no uh no feder

182
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:18,240
arose but when it does you know the feder of aversion It arises in the mind

183
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,400
dependent on hearing the sound So it it arises sort of between the ear and the

184
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,000
sound that's being heard uh in a kind of metaphorical way And the mind gives

185
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,040
meaning to the feeling of aversion It assigns you know the intention of

186
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,560
pushing me to work faster to this innocent sound that the little plastic

187
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,119
monk is making And of course that's a very simple very simple

188
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:53,119
example but I think it it points um its ordinariness the very ordinariness of it

189
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:59,440
points to how easy it is for some kind of fetter to arise in dependence on what

190
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:06,520
we hear And there are sounds that have the potential to give rise to a lot more

191
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,200
discomfort and stress in the mind because of the associations we have with

192
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:18,720
them Um a siren you know a some kind of emergency vehicle or police vehicle

193
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:26,079
close by Someone screaming you know a person screaming a baby or a child or an

194
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:32,079
adult who's crying who's weeping natural sounds like thunder for

195
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,760
some of us whistling wind screech of brakes and the sound of a car skidding

196
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,920
hitting something Lots of in instances of hearing something where um some kind

197
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,720
of reactivity is immediately likely to pop up And sometimes it might be very

198
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:58,000
sensible You know if we're crossing a street and suddenly hear the screech of a car's brakes you know we don't need to

199
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,040
examine the feder that's arising in our minds We need to you know just look

200
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,160
around and see is there danger or is there danger for someone else if not for

201
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,599
me but there are also many times many times

202
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:21,319
when we hear a sound that gives rise to strong reactivity some form of grasping or

203
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:26,800
aversion And uh there is no pressing need to understand the source of the

204
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:33,680
sound or to take action There is instead just this hook the sound of a particular

205
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,119
person's voice Maybe now we hear it immediately We turn away from it maybe

206
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,480
turn off the radio We we heard the sound The feder arose and there we found

207
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,839
ourselves You know maybe chest constricted heartbeating faster mind

208
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:55,640
kind of darkened you know cons closed

209
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:02,800
There's a story that um Ajan Sha the very highly regarded Thai um master of

210
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,319
the of the last century monastic teacher teacher of many of our teachers he told

211
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:15,520
this story that he was staying in a a hut um outside a village in Thailand for

212
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:22,720
a period of intensive um meditation practice and the people in the village were having some kind of a a celebration

213
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:29,119
a festival And they had loudspeakers up around around the village in trees and whatnot

214
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:35,720
different high places and they were pumping out really loud music Thai pop

215
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:42,880
music And Ajan Cha reacted by just getting livid He stormed around his hut

216
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,480
he said asking himself how those disres disrespectful villagers could be so

217
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:54,319
thoughtless you know with no regard for this monastic who's trying to become

218
00:43:54,319 --> 00:44:00,000
free free of suffering right outside the village It was an honor for the village

219
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,119
to have a meditating monk staying there and they you know they should so respect

220
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:10,880
etc etc etc is just going on and this kind of thinking he said he acknowledged

221
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,119
went on for a couple of days and then he said he had a sudden

222
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:23,880
recognition it's not the sound bothering me he thought I'm bothering the

223
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:30,960
sound it's me bothering the sound and his mind quieted the sound ceased to be

224
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,680
a problem the problem was the bothering that was in his mind the aversive

225
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:43,760
reaction the feder And on the other end of the

226
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,280
spectrum from aversion you know we might hear the sound the sound of a a

227
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,400
chocolate bar being unwrapped in the next room you know and suddenly there's

228
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:01,119
a strong desire for chocolate in the mind Some chocolate and we can just take a piece We can enjoy it and be done with

229
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:07,960
it But if we hadn't heard the sound would we have even thought about

230
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:17,040
chocolate now the sound was familiar and the mental associations that were already present in us gave rise to a

231
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:23,280
fetter maybe I want some And in both those cases you know

232
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:29,839
the mind can tend to blame the sound we heard for the feeling that arises

233
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:36,640
You know I can think it's the little monks hitting that gong that is bothering me or it's the fault of the

234
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:44,520
person who unwrapped the chocolate that now I want some But if we really look at what's

235
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:52,720
happening we can see that sound is just sound It's the reactivity that arises in

236
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:59,800
the mind that's the source of our irritation our hunger for chocolate

237
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,920
I'm seeing in the in the YouTube feed there's some uh visual distortion I

238
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:16,680
don't know if that's happening for others or if it's just me I hope uh it's not happening for you

239
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:36,560
So this is a sound going to I'm just know what I can do about that

240
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:44,960
actually Yeah intermittently losing sound Okay let me see what's happening

241
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:52,119
here Maybe uh I don't think I should stop the the

242
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:58,240
uh the feed That will be that could create a big

243
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:05,599
problem Yeah I can see that uh something is going on I'm just going

244
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:11,920
to have to I'm just going to have to continue I think because I don't know I don't I

245
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,799
don't know what the technical issue is here

246
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:25,680
I think it's okay Okay So so it's the reactivity that arises in

247
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:33,280
the mind That's the source of our irritation you know the source of our our hunger for chocolate And and that's

248
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:40,560
what the texts ask us to to do to recognize the feder that has arisen

249
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:45,760
um between the sense of hearing and the sound we've heard It's okay and to let

250
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,280
it go And how do we let it go well a

251
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:57,880
practice that can be helpful is to relax the mind moving from listening to simply

252
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:03,839
hearing letting the sound be sound instead of bothering the sound to use

253
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,680
Ajan Sha's expression

254
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:17,280
So yesterday I asked you to experiment with the difference between seeing and looking and uh and that's an exercise

255
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:23,520
that uh that we can do um uh any time you know to just notice the difference

256
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:29,440
in the mind in the body between these two ways of using the auditory sense And

257
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,640
I I asked you to do that a little bit in the uh in the meditation just to notice

258
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:42,160
when this urge towards uh towards listening um arises and what what is you

259
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:50,359
know what's driving that urge what's driving that urge

260
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:15,630
[Music]

261
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:31,119
did something happen when I rang the bell you

262
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:40,160
know was there a fed or a hook or m was it just a sound you know maybe a pleasant sound while it

263
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:48,240
lasted Just notice Just notice So today I just I want to encourage you to attend

264
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:55,240
to what arises when you hear different sounds during the day You know as you go through your life what's the mental

265
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:00,760
response is there reactivity is there some flavor of desire some flavor of

266
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:08,720
aversion i think each of us probably has a a vast library of sound memories that

267
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:14,960
hold connotations for us Some will condition the arising of joy

268
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,960
of love maybe of appreciation or gratitude beautiful qualities And with

269
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,160
some there might just be a hook you know something that isn't so lovely And it's

270
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,359
really good to see those because obstacles we don't see they continue to

271
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:40,319
drive us But once we do see those uh those uh we can eventually let go of

272
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:45,839
seeing them is the first step So thank you for your attention today Sorry about

273
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:51,440
any technical glitches that arose and I'll see you tomorrow tomorrow morning

274
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:57,040
Pacific time Have a good day
