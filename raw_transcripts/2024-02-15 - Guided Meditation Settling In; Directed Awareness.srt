7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,120

9
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:10,600
warm welcome to you this day whatever time it is for you and delighted to be here with you

10
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm about to start the recording here we

11
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:25,280
go so the invitation is this morning to settle

12
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,799
into meditation I'll do a very short review um just the context of this week

13
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,920
I'm covering essential elements or core elements of mindfulness that kind of

14
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,079
aren't part of the normal IMC intro to mindfulness series Gil has been doing

15
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,200
over the last number of weeks and this week that's been on Vena or feeling

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,280
tone attitudes of mind on Tuesday and Wednesday and today I'll be talking

17
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,759
about the capacity our minds have for directed attention

18
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:09,039
so with that the invitation is to settle into a posture that's a good balance of

19
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,360
relaxation and alertness whatever that means for

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:25,040
you it can be helpful if you're sitting or lying down to have your head aligned with your

21
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,760
spine balanced over your shoulders front and back and side to side

22
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,040
and check and make sure that you're balanced left and right over your hip

23
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,760
points sometimes people like to sway a little bit forward and back side to

24
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,560
side and just check in make sure you're

25
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,760
grounded then taking a couple of longer slower deeper

26
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:11,480
breaths as an invitation to come into your body touch into your

27
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,879
embodiment releasing any excess tension on the out

28
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:34,640
breath and then allowing allowing the breathing to return to

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,519
normal if you haven't already softening the eyes or closing

30
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:57,000
them and as we've done this week scanning through very briefly scanning

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,799
through your body noticing any feelings of pleasant or

32
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,319
unpleasant and just acknowledging them no need to hang out

33
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,639
there but just feeling any tension or

34
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,600
relaxation any other kinds of pleasant or unpleasant that want to reveal

35
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
themselves

36
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,759
and then more globally perhaps just checking in how am I

37
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,800
today what's the overall [Music]

38
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,680
mood so we've been talking about the frame of mind or attitude today starting

39
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:05,160
this meditation and allowing acknowledging whatever that

40
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:15,000
is with as much kindness graciousness as

41
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:38,240
possible and then settling in settling into whatever object of

42
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:46,400
attention makes most sense for your mind heart body this

43
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,960
morning I'll give instructions on the breath today and the invitation is if the

44
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,560
breath doesn't work for you whatever reason to adapt those

45
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:09,440
instructions to a more Global sense of Your Body Sensations or to

46
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,440
hearing so again tuning into your

47
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,000
body noticing any sense of motion or

48
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,720
Stillness especially ATT

49
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:43,400
tuning to the motion sensations of your life's

50
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,120
breath noticing any soothing or

51
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,160
pleasurable sensations of the

52
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,240
breath and acknowledging if the breath isn't that way right now it's just

53
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,918
neutral neither Pleasant nor

54
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:27,039
unpleasant allowing any kind of sensation of breathing to be

55
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
okay

56
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:44,319
resting on the rhythmic in and out of your body

57
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:05,120
breathing tuning in to wherever the breath feels most noticeable obvious for

58
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:16,240
you perhaps H the chest the subtle up and down or the

59
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,080
nostrils the difference between the exhale and the

60
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,560
inhale or what for many people most relaxing

61
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:38,880
the gentle rise and fall wave like motion of breathing in the belly

62
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,880
diaphragmatic

63
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:05,720
breathing noticing the subtle differences between the beginning of the

64
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:14,160
inhale the middle of the inhale and the top the

65
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:21,880
fullness of the inhale and then noticing tuning into

66
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,600
that moment the exhale

67
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,000
begins allowing the exhale perhaps to be a

68
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,640
little bit longer noticing the middle of the

69
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:52,920
exhale and perhaps that tiny pause at the end of the exhale resting in

70
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:01,120
that allowing the breathing to be

71
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:10,079
natural becoming a dedicated

72
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:15,200
Observer companion with all of the tiny

73
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,680
Sensations in each

74
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
breath

75
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,480
de father sounds

76
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,480
Sensations arisings pull the attention from the

77
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,880
breath or your primary object of focus

78
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,720
the invitation is to gently acknowledge whatever has

79
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,440
arisen be with it for as long as it's

80
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,720
predominant as an

81
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,839
event and then unpossible

82
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:08,959
returning to the primary attention on the o object of

83
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,279
breathing this

84
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:22,480
breath each breath like no

85
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,760
other what's this breath like

86
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:26,520
in the final moments of this meditation the invitation is to

87
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:35,440
open open the lens the scope of the mindful

88
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:44,039
awareness to include everything everything arising In This

89
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,120
Moment noticing in

90
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:59,519
particular overall sense mood

91
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,679
what's the overall feeling

92
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:28,200
tone and resting with that acknowledging any

93
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:35,840
moment in this meditation that we're challenging with as much kindness

94
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:43,200
and graciousness as [Music] possible and soaking

95
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,679
in steeping in any moments of Peace

96
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:56,399
subtleness mindfulness and in your own good

97
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:01,640
intentions coming to this period of

98
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:19,240
practice and from that place turning your internal gaze

99
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,320
outwards to all the others this life

100
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:32,398
touches known and unknown seen and unseen close and

101
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:40,720
distant and wishing them well perhaps making the determination

102
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,360
that in some way small or large our practice here together can

103
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,360
benefit them as

104
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:04,039
well and all beings everywhere be safe peaceful and

105
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,760
free thank you for the sincerity of your

106
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
practice

107
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:39,200
oh good morning again everyone warm welcome wherever and whenever you

108
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,279
are and um I'm feeling so settled I almost don't

109
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:50,559
want to talk but um I'll talk I promise to talk so here I

110
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:58,200
am this um this week this context for this week is that it's a series on kind

111
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,399
of essential elements of mindfulness that support the growth of our practice and

112
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,120
even the beginning of our practice and I'll do a quick review

113
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:17,639
later but I'm for now I just want to jump into today's topic which is directed

114
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:22,799
attention so rather than talk about what directed attention is we'll start with a

115
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:30,240
brief exercise so Focus your attention on one of your [Music]

116
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:38,320
hand not the image or the concept of your hand but the felt experience of it

117
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:45,519
from the inside out tingling pulsing warmth or

118
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:54,039
cool aliveness and allow your awareness to

119
00:32:54,039 --> 00:33:01,639
fill your hand perhaps the way water fills a

120
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:11,559
[Music] sponge

121
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:16,360
now shift your attention to your

122
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:24,399
foot same way inside out how hard was

123
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:32,279
that really easy right so the capacity of placing our attention

124
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:38,440
in a certain area of the body or even other aspects of our

125
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,639
experience that's directed attention sometimes a metaphor can be

126
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:51,399
used like looking through a people or looking through a telescope versus looking out an open

127
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:56,559
door or an open window in reality though directed

128
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:02,159
attention in meditation or in life is less like looking through a small

129
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:09,440
cylindrical object and more it's a form of selective attention which we as

130
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,240
humans simply have most of us if we have our correct neurology and everything's

131
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:21,440
working okay so an example here if you are in a

132
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,679
crowded Plaza and looking for a friend and you find your good friend

133
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:35,320
and she or he is a long way away so you start walking towards them you aren't totally unaware that

134
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:42,358
there are other people around or other objects around but the bulk of your attention is on tracking where that

135
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:50,878
person is so that you can arrive to be with them that is the kind of directed

136
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:58,440
attention that helps many people settle in to meditation we're putting the bulk

137
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:04,599
of our attention on one thing and allowing other things to kind of be in the periphery

138
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:11,040
right it's a kind of filtering process filtering of less Salient information

139
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,760
and it's a natural and necessary part of human cognition

140
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,920
right so for the purposes of mindfulness meditation as I did this morning we

141
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,560
often use breathing as the object of attention

142
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:34,240
sometimes Body Sensations work better for some people or sound in meta meditation the object of

143
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,440
directed attention is the intention of meta perhaps the

144
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:47,160
phrases this directed attention is a powerful capacity it's essential for Learning for

145
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,240
Life and for meditation and as many of you have

146
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:59,000
already discovered it helps many people settle faster or or subtle at all in the

147
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:06,240
meditation process faster than just letting the mind kind of roam around and be and do whatever it wants which often

148
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:12,960
results in daydreaming fantasy checking up

149
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,520
so it can help coax our minds away from this wanting and not wanting this greed

150
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,520
and aversion that I've been talking about this week and eventually it can help

151
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:33,200
attenuate the those Tendencies to glom on to whatever we

152
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:39,920
like or don't like in a moment by repeatedly gently placing the

153
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,200
attention somewhere normal soothing perhaps

154
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:52,680
neutral-ish though that can shift as we've talked about another feature of directed

155
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,800
attention that's helpful to know about that's not as often talk talked about is

156
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,079
that sometimes directed attention that filtering can allow other things that

157
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:11,760
come up to shape experience without you noticing

158
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,520
so that's why it can be helpful to start or occasionally check in about whatever

159
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,880
else is present so you may remember at the beginning of the

160
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,920
meditation I as many meditation teachers do encourage you to just check out

161
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:35,119
whatever the mood General frame of mind was before directing your attention to the

162
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:45,359
breathing this is to acknowledge anything else that might be coming along with our attention into our

163
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:53,359
experience it's really um possible for these other dimensions of experience to

164
00:37:53,359 --> 00:38:00,599
kind of slip in and get cultivated along with stability of mind if there's a

165
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:07,720
general sense of unpleasant for example and I don't acknowledge it that next

166
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:14,040
layer after the V the feeling tone of unpleasant could be a

167
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:21,079
general about meditation that day you know general not wanting or

168
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:27,720
grumpiness so this is part of the review of the last few days Vena feeling tone was what we call on

169
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:34,640
Monday and if it's unseen it can kind of filter tint

170
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,880
experience in a way that isn't so helpful for example if I'm having hip

171
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,760
pain and I don't notice that it's just hip pain or I do and the mindfulness isn't

172
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:54,640
that strong I might be averse to it and stay averse to it I want to shift and

173
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,280
make it go away that's the unpleasant and the not wanting boom boom in the

174
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:09,800
chain of events so that feeling tone can be very

175
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:16,000
simple and if I just acknowledge oh pain sometimes it can just stay excuse

176
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,640
me with the unpleasantness and I don't have to build a story about it of like

177
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:28,040
oh this is cancer and D D D D D or you know oh I need to go back to the doctor you know doesn't have to take me away to

178
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:34,040
this whole story this whole house of cards the acknowledgement of the simple

179
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:39,720
feeling tone of what is can cut through even very elaborate stories unhelpful

180
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:45,839
stories projected outwards so then there's that next layer

181
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:50,960
that happens for most of us common reactions in this case it was

182
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:58,079
the not wanting these can become overall attitudes or frames of mind

183
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:04,200
oriented to wanting or not wanting otherwise known as greed or

184
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:11,440
aversion all forms of craving it can be for example a habitual

185
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,599
wanting of a nice experience or a nice view or a nice breath and then I'm

186
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:23,720
judging all of my experience through that filter of well it's supposed to be like

187
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:30,760
this that's also maybe not so helpful and the beautiful thing about

188
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,839
this is that shifting to mindful awareness of the

189
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:45,720
attitude helps develop greater discernment and helps attenuate move the attitude to be less

190
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:52,760
less informative or authoritative about my

191
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,839
experience and as I talked about yesterday the attit ude of mind can also

192
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:03,160
influence the feeling tone so

193
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:11,960
if I go into a room every day to meditate and it's Pleasant it's got sort

194
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:17,119
of the perfect lighting and Ambiance maybe there's a pleasant scent in the

195
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:23,480
background a perfect place to sit that conditions a certain kind of

196
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:32,839
attitude and once my attitude is

197
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:41,200
set I'll have a pleasant association with that place conversely if it's a place I'm not

198
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,319
explaining this very well um basically what I'm saying is our attitude about an

199
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:54,520
experience can inform how pleasant or unpleasant it is let me give another example I gave this earlier in the class

200
00:41:54,520 --> 00:42:01,240
if we feel the touch sh someone's hand on our shoulder it's a completely different

201
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:06,880
experience if it's a good friend or a lover or if it's a presumptuous

202
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:13,960
acquaintance who's a little bit obnoxious so our attitude towards the

203
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:21,160
situation towards the experience can actually shift the perception of

204
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:29,319
it finally Wednesday we talked about wholesome or beneficial attitudes of

205
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:37,280
mind for meditation generosity of spirit simple allowing contentment appreciative

206
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:43,720
interest inquiry

207
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:50,440
equinity all of those are onward leading for the practice and all of those can be practiced in relationship to anything

208
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:57,480
else that's arising if I have appreciative inquiry about my version

209
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:04,599
it can attenuate it or at least lead to Greater discernment greater wisdom about

210
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:12,119
it so mindfulness can transform even unpleasant experiences and

211
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:17,440
predispositions into information food for

212
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,640
awakening so back to directed attention all of this matters because if we're

213
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:31,000
meditating on a specific object it's really helpful to intentionally

214
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:38,280
cultivate positive openhearted interest allowing accepting

215
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:44,160
non-c contention to allow experience to come in the full full range of

216
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,200
experience to come into our mindfulness versus be left out of it and

217
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:55,760
accidentally come along with it so it's helpful with each meditation

218
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:02,280
to make maybe start by checking the attitude or frame of mind

219
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:08,000
unseen predispositions attitudes towards greed or aversion can be subdued by

220
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,200
directed attention attenuated by them or sometimes they can tag along if our

221
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,720
attention is developed elsewhere so the encouragement is to take a few moments in each

222
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:27,119
meditation and notice notice whatever the of mind or

223
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:36,040
mood or general inclination is so it can be seen clearly and develop greater

224
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:42,319
discernment thank you for your practice a delight to be with you today and we

225
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:48,000
have just a moment or two I'll answer one or two questions and then um be back

226
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,520
with some of you tomorrow it's been enjoy may all beings

227
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,960
benefit

228
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,440
oh Brian very bad tontis that is

229
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:49,079
um that's unpleasant I'm sorry to hear that I have heard two different schools

230
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:54,280
of thought on this I rarely experience it myself so these are both from other

231
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:59,680
people um one is to let your attention

232
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:07,520
be much broader than just one object to allow to allow a broader wash of

233
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:15,200
experiences so that the hearing is just one thread within it so that's

234
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:21,480
one I know one person for whom it worked to

235
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:27,480
completely merge with the hearing experience and found it to be a great

236
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:33,440
concentration object that may or may not work for you so I would experiment with it with a

237
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,960
little Caution and then finally this kind of taichi move that I've been

238
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,640
talking about this week which is to really notice your attitude towards it

239
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,680
and focus more on that maybe sometimes there's aversion maybe sometimes it's

240
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,720
okay that to take a step back I hope that's

241
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:01,640
helpful so some other great questions coming in here um how do you distinguish

242
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:08,280
between attention and awareness so Greg I'm not sure if you were here at the very beginning of the talk but I didn't

243
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:14,640
frame it this way but this is indeed what it was so when I asked people to place their attention on their

244
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:20,480
hand that's the capacity of attention especially if it moves from your hand to your

245
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,960
foot the fact that you're aware of the movement of your attention from your

246
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:33,319
hand to your foot is the awareness so the attention is what moves and the awareness is what sees the

247
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:38,880
moving Peter can there be too much control of attention from the control

248
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:46,280
Power Tower of the Mind absolutely can the real encouragement in this

249
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:54,440
practice is to settle in to the embodied experience rather than controlling the

250
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:00,839
experience from the mind mind so that filling of the hand with awareness by a

251
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:06,000
Spong like a sponge that is a very different

252
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,839
experience than Imagining the hand and trying to control my experience at the

253
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:17,799
hand so you may experiment

254
00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:24,079
with rather than um having the locus of attention be in the

255
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:30,640
head checking how it feels to feel from the belly or the

256
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:38,359
body just going to check here I think that's a little bit about each of them

257
00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:46,079
I'm also going to be offering um some Q&A in my blog on my website at the end

258
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:51,480
of the month so um I will do my best to capture the questions I haven't had time

259
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:57,319
to answer and address them now I'll put that link in tomorrow

260
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:03,000
one more from Mary L this will be the last one troubling situation is very

261
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,839
prevalent in the heart how in meditation to keep attention on the

262
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:17,160
anchor so sometimes you can't if it's really up then it can be helpful to turn

263
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:23,240
the attention to your heart the feelings under the

264
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:32,160
situation the feelings under the situation so noticing the sadness or the

265
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:38,720
anxiety or the resistance or whatever is there and attending to that with

266
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:45,680
kindness with awareness it can be really helpful not

267
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:51,000
to allow the thoughts just to proliferate and instead come to the

268
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,280
embodied part of the emotions and give yourself breaks

269
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:02,520
give yourself breaks so thank you everyone for your attention and look forward to being with

270
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,000
you tomorrow
