1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,280
so hello and welcome and

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,360
uh I feel kind of delighted to be back at IMC and to be able

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:20,160
to welcome you all and feel your welcome uh to be sitting here and the

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,400
opportunity to share the practice with you

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,320
all and um when I was a

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:39,480
child uh sometimes when traveling with my family in a car was sitting in the back seat and i' love to roll if we were

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,480
on the freeway I would love to roll down the window and stick my hand out with my

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,600
palm flat like a like a wing of a plane and had and move my hand up and down

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:02,800
feeling the lift and the and the push down of um of the of you know the wind

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:10,960
uh and I just put me right there in the present moment I just felt like I was completely absorbed in this kind of uh

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,119
constant movement of the wind against my hand this morning I bicycle down to IMC

12
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,320
and there was part of the Time bicycling down especially coming down the hill

13
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:30,200
where there was kind of exhilarating feeling of just being fully present uh there was something about the

14
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,680
speed the being being carried the gravity that really uh put me into the

15
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,799
present moment Without Really any other cares except the exhilaration of being

16
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,399
carried Along by the bicycle so there's a way of

17
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,880
meditating uh which is relatively peaceful but puts us right in the

18
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,159
present moment so that it feels like in the present in the immediacy of now we're

19
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,880
being carried we're like riding the bicycle or being carried by a wave if

20
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,920
you've ever body surfed or um been carried by a wave

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,800
or in a there was a delightful place in West Virginia got carried Along by the

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,120
current of the river it was just such a wonderful feeling to be carried

23
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,360
along and uh to be carried along with a right in the present moment on the wave

24
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,879
of the present moment in in the west the Western culture the Futures often seem

25
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,159
to be ahead of us but there are cultures where the future is in the uh in the

26
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:51,480
back catching up to us and lifting us up into the into lifting us up as we go

27
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,959
along and all we can really see is the past and um which is somehow in this

28
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:05,280
kind of culture uh in front of us but the past which we can't see is lifting us up carrying along and this idea that

29
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:13,599
we're on a wave of the present moment and there's a way of exhilarating way of really being

30
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:21,280
here present for this moment riding that wave riding that Razor's Edge riding

31
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,879
right here and when I was going down in the bicycle down the hill today um there

32
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:33,439
were lots of things around me to see cars and trees and houses and things but

33
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:39,040
um those just all kind of receded receded receded I didn't stop to look at

34
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:46,840
them I didn't consider them I didn't get involved I just was there being being carried along down the down the hill so

35
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:55,040
there's a delightful way of being fully in the moment in this very little saddles sometimes has been called

36
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,079
a Saddleback of the present uh right there maybe the the um

37
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:09,280
bike seat of the present uh uh right there and um and allow ourselves let

38
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,480
everything else just kind of be left behind left behind just stay with the

39
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,000
coming the coming stay with the rising the what's lifting us up what's bringing

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,520
us into the present what's the wave of time so if this makes any sense uh you

41
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,800
might want to experiment for us for this practice this uh this morning and that

42
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,400
is that it's not simply being mindful because sometimes if uh mindfulness too

43
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,600
cognitive um we're uh we're behind the present moment we we take a moment or

44
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,520
two or three or more to recognize what's happening in ourselves and what's

45
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,960
happening is already changed very quickly and so the idea is to cognize or

46
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:08,000
be aware in the immediacy of now Carri it along Carri it along and many things

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,520
that we could know uh can just fall away Fall Away in as we stay knowing the

48
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:23,440
immediacy of now so and if this doesn't make sense to you or is confusing for you please by

49
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:31,639
all means just discard it and practice how you normally would so to um

50
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:40,440
begin setting set setting ourselves into this saddle seat of the present moment

51
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:47,319
that metaphor is used because it's kind of like a U-shaped and there's no clear idea of exactly where the present moment

52
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:53,160
is but it's a little bit includes a little bit of the future a little bit the past

53
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,600
perhaps or the surfboard of the present moment and surf

54
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,080
surfboards are little bit sticking out into the empty space in front of the

55
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:11,599
wave and a little bit of it's in the back of embedded in the wave and um a

56
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:19,280
little bit to be on a surf b of time is to have some sense of the the The

57
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:26,039
Emptiness inead of us the potential the openness in front of us of time and

58
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:31,639
little bit is kind of being carried by the path into the present in staying

59
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:39,319
right there balanced so placing ourselves here now

60
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:45,199
in this body gently closing the

61
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,639
eyes and with the eyes closed to sense and feel the present

62
00:06:52,639 --> 00:07:00,879
moment experience of being in a body and to try to do it without

63
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:08,440
focusing or being preoccupied by any particular aspect of your body any pain

64
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:15,120
or discomfort or tension just going to be open to all the

65
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,400
body the full body

66
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:30,280
experience as if your whole body is a surfboard or the bicycle or

67
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,160
the hand in the

68
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:45,240
wind and then this whole body experience to take a few long slow deep

69
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,120
breaths relaxing the body as you

70
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:56,960
exhale long exhale with the extended

71
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:04,479
settling the weight of your body into here and

72
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,159
now letting your breathing return to

73
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:35,360
normal feeling your whole whole body and within your

74
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:48,279
body the influence that breathing in and breathing out has on your

75
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,880
body again not fixating on any particular way if the breathing is

76
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,920
uncomfortable or not to be preoccupied with

77
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,839
that the broad experience of breathing in the

78
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:17,760
back rib cage the sides of your rib

79
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:27,760
cage the shoulders deep in the belly

80
00:09:51,240 --> 00:10:00,320
in this surfing on the present moment you might feel it sense it riding

81
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,160
the changing waves are breathing in and breathing out in the

82
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,560
body the inhale is kind of like catching the

83
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:20,920
wave the exhale is riding the wave being carried by

84
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,200
the momentum of breathing

85
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:31,320
out being lifted by the inhale

86
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,560
carried by the exhale to the bottom of the

87
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:49,480
wave right there with breathing is where to ride the present

88
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,639
moment perhaps letting everything else

89
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:04,160
recede into the background into the past that for

90
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:13,440
now it's okay to let all things be left

91
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:21,320
alone except rting experience or

92
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,279
breathing if it's possible not to focus on the ways that breathing

93
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:37,320
is uncomfortable but maybe there's an edge

94
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,040
of breathing someplace in your

95
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:52,920
body it let you feel a little bit like the kid with his hand out the

96
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,360
window the hand riding the wind

97
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,200
breathing in and breathing

98
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
out

99
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

100
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120

e e

103
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:15,680
following riding the breath and all your thoughts are simply

104
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:25,160
scenery nothing to be involved in riding the breath riding the bicycle

105
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:32,959
letting the scenery Fall Away in favor

106
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:43,319
of writing the breath in the present moment here

107
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
now

108
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

109
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

110
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

111
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

112

e

116
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

117
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

118
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
for e

119
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,640
as you exhale

120
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,919
relax the

121
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:22,600
body relax into riding the wave of

122
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:34,520
exhaling as you inhale open up

123
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:43,000
release be open to the lifting and

124
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,440
expanding we're being lifted on the inhale expanding

125
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:06,400
did and relaxing and settling on the

126
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:13,600
exhale is to be right here in the

127
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:23,520
present with everything else just the scenery that passes by no need to be involved in

128
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
it

129
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

130
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

131
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

132
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for

133
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

134
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

135
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

136
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

137
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
for e

138
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,240
and then as we come to the end of this

139
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:46,320
sitting to again settle relax on the

140
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:56,360
exhale softening the shoulders the belly the face

141
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:11,519
and perhaps even there can be a softening or opening on the

142
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:28,760
inhale relaxing and opening the mind on the E as you exhale and inhale

143
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,440
softening the thinking

144
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:50,039
mind and if you're gentle perhaps you can gently soften relax the

145
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:58,039
heart as you exhale letting the heart settle

146
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:07,158
and allowing the heart to open on the

147
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:17,440
inhale and imagine now coming to the

148
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:24,039
end that with an open hand an open mind an open

149
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:32,799
heart you're ready to meet the world to meet

150
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:40,000
others and to do so with Good Will with well

151
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,840
wishing wishing others well may others be happy and peaceful

152
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:56,559
and safe may my focus be a little bit less

153
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,799
on myself and more in the well-being of

154
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:12,398
others and may this be a way of caring for myself May each of you each of

155
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:23,120
us know that we care for ourselves when we have good will for

156
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,279
others may all beings be happy

157
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:38,398
may all beings be safe may all beings be

158
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,240
peaceful may all beings be

159
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,880
free and may how each of us moves

160
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:57,360
through the world support the well-being of others

so good day everyone and welcome to the second talk on the characteristics of the

166
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:17,480
Buddha teachings the Dharma and the way that the chant that describes these five

167
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:24,639
characteristics begins it says the wells spoken dhama of the

168
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:31,080
Buddha and then it goes on and describes it as being the well-spoken teachings of the Buddha

169
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:37,840
dhama of the Buddha is uh directly

170
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,960
visible immediate inviting

171
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,519
inspection onward leading and to be personally experienced

172
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,398
by the wise and

173
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:00,639
um the um so these teachings of the

174
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:06,720
Buddha have these five characteristics and I like to think of these five

175
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,440
characteristics as being a kind of reverse engineering of the Dharma of the Buddhist

176
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:19,560
teachings that um somehow taking all of it Buddha teachings into account that um

177
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:26,240
uh if we can kind of get back to the basic principles basic orientation that uh the Buddhist

178
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:32,158
teachings are based on and um and these are all uh based

179
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:39,040
on five ways in which we are personally engaged personally involved with the

180
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,839
Dharma with the practice that it's not an abstract form of philosophy it's not

181
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:51,040
a abstract form of uh reflection and thinking about things um that can be

182
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,358
part of certainly a Dharma life but uh to really be involved with the Dharma

183
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:02,839
practice which is the Buddha what the Buddha was most interested in was pointing people to practice to the

184
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:09,400
degree to which he was a philosopher it was all for the purpose of getting people

185
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,560
into uh a deep momentto moment experience or practice that is

186
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,280
liberating and we see this emphasis on Direct experience One's Own Way of being

187
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,400
way of seeing and experiencing emphasized that the Buddhist in these

188
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:32,599
five characteristics of the Buddhist teachings the well-spoken teachings of the Buddha is something for each of us

189
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:38,240
to um uh uh directly see for

190
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:44,119
ourselves that it's immediate in our experience that it invites us these

191
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:50,760
teachings invite us to look for ourselves this is not a teaching to believe something to take something in

192
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,200
the abstract to uh trust someone else's uh uh idea of what's real but rather to

193
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,200
hear what what the Buddha say and inspect it for ourselves find out in our own experience what's

194
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:11,079
true and so for today the emphasis is this second characteristic which is aalo

195
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:17,920
in p and um uh and most literally

196
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:27,839
aalo the a is a negative prefix for and kalak is a time so not of time and and

197
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:32,920
uh some people translate it as Timeless and um and some people

198
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:39,680
translate it as immediate and both translations are good uh I prefer

199
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:47,440
immediate because it puts puts practice in the immediacy of here and now um I also like the word Timeless if

200
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,520
we understand Timeless to meaning that um it's still relevant today as much as

201
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:00,240
it was 25 200 years ago in the time of the Buddha that there's some kind of way in which the Buddha is pointing to a

202
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:06,800
universal characteristics or qualities or practices of the human being that

203
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,839
we're just as human as the people were in the time of the Buddha and some of

204
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:19,400
the same human issues that they dealt with then are what we're dealing with now the same need to find ourselves in

205
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,800
the present moment and resolve how we get caught and how we get uh tied up and

206
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:32,280
stressed in the present moment are as valuable now as they were in the time of the Buddha so in that sense the teachings

207
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,640
are current they're Timeless they're as relevant today as they were back

208
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,839
then and um so these two ways of translating alalo but I like immediate

209
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:49,240
because there's an immediacy to that there like okay here right now not

210
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,520
anywhere else and so there well spoken teachings of the Buddha point to

211
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:00,400
something that's immediately perceivable for ourselves here and

212
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,280
now and uh yesterday I mentioned that in defining in describing how the Buddha

213
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:14,880
how the Dharma has these five characteristics the Buddha says that that they're found in the ending of

214
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:21,720
greed hate and delusion in another place he talks about how we see the how it's

215
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:29,640
directly visible and immediate inviting inspection um in uh when we've abandoned

216
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:35,359
a certain afflictions and he lists 17 different ways in which we're afflicted

217
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:42,079
by emotions which have a lot to do with how we relate to others so uh when we

218
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:49,200
have uh lust and covetousness when we have clinging desire for others in

219
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:57,319
certain ways or we covet what they have or what others have or covet things um that uh if we have ill will

220
00:38:57,319 --> 00:39:02,760
and and hatred if we have envy and jealousy if we have contempt for others

221
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,240
and conceit in relationship to others all these things are afflictive

222
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,720
emotions that humans carry all too easily but when we are able to let go of

223
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:19,200
those in the Letting Go the letting go even though it might seem like a slow

224
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:25,280
and gradual process to let go but when we finally let go the immediacy of that

225
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,319
experience of Freedom the immed medy of that possibility of living

226
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:36,800
without um these afflictive social emotions is

227
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,599
um um that's what he's pointing to the Dharma is pointing to that possibility

228
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:50,000
to experience this for ourselves and for some of us who can't do this immediately fully completely

229
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,880
there's the immediacy of doing it gradually to relax to soften to begin to

230
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:04,640
lighten up to not be so wrapped up in uh these afflictive emotions but to step

231
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,240
back and to see them clearly to uh make space around them to not be so

232
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:17,000
influenced or pushed around by them or trapped by them even to do it gradually

233
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:25,359
there's something about how we can experience that in the present moment in the immedi of now that is a powerful

234
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:30,960
teacher for us it shows us what's possible possible it shows us the the U

235
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,920
the possibility of a of a continual and gradual path moment to moment of

236
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:44,240
softening relaxing making space not being caught and so there's something about

237
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,359
seeing the Dharma in the immediate present that uh the Buddha is

238
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:56,560
emphasizing so it's visible here and now it's something that we can see and we we

239
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:04,040
don't see it you know in the abstract in the world out there we see it the in the immediacy

240
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:12,400
of our present moment experience to bring these two together is fascinating that it's directly visible

241
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:19,480
here and now and it's immediate in our experience um it's directly

242
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:24,760
experienced here and now immediatly in how we

243
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:32,880
see so uh it's directly visible but in how we see how we

244
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:39,040
view uh our experience we can experience the stress or the absence of stress we

245
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:46,480
can experience the fear and the hesitation and the absence of hesitation and fear anxiety we can experience the

246
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:54,400
ways in which we tighten up and strain to be aware to see to know something uh

247
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,319
and we can be aware of relaxing in having a relaxed Vision relaxed

248
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:05,800
knowing right there we can know in the immediacy of now the

249
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:13,920
Dharma and so we want to begin focusing on how we experience the world so even

250
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:20,640
if the experience of ourselves the world is uncomfortable to us how we experience

251
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:27,480
it is something we can change and adjust we can find our freedom in how we know

252
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:34,079
we don't have to change the world we can find Freedom in changing

253
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,920
ourselves and in changing ourselves we do begin changing the world we live in

254
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:46,680
if we're not in caught up in greed ha and delusion caught up in afflictive Social emotions that makes a world of

255
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:51,920
difference for others so to learn slowly step by step

256
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,400
here and now in the small steps and the big steps how to be free

257
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:06,079
this is how the Dharma is immediate so

258
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:12,720
um so you might as you go through the day today

259
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,920
um consider this aspect of the immediacy

260
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:24,119
of the Dharma what is it that you can where can you find

261
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:31,280
Freedom and how you're present for this life in the immediacy of your

262
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:38,720
experience and certainly I hope you begin appreciating how we don't find Freedom when we linger

263
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:47,480
in uh preoccupations linger in uh fantasy and thoughts and ideas and

264
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:52,760
projections of the future and judgments but there's something even more

265
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:59,200
immediate than those that where we find Freedom space

266
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:08,000
openness non- entanglement can you find it even in small degrees as you go through the day

267
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,960
and if you find it in small degrees here and now take that as a teacher take that

268
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:21,240
as a Way Forward even the smallest relaxation is a teacher for you smallest

269
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:27,119
relaxation points you to a Way Forward here and now in the midy of now to

270
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:34,800
greater and greater relaxation openness and freedom so uh thank

271
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:43,400
you very much and um look forward to continuing all this tomorrow
