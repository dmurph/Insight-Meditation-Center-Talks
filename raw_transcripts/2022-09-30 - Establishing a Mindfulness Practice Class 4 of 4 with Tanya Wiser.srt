14
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:59,280
second week was mindfulness on and off the cushion third week was actions that

15
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,500
support Joy and this week is establishing and sustaining our practice with wise effort

16
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,580
and if you signed up for the prac the handouts it's all in there and I'll

18
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,940
so I'm just wondering before I kind of go a little bit more into today's topic

19
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,459
if there are any questions or responses that are residual um

20
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:35,340
that I can answer for any of you nope

21
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,459
good all good and I have a question a different question since you don't have any for me

22
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:47,000
I have one for you did any of you focus on moments of

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,400
well-being or Joy this week and if you take in yeah

24
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,459
Corey you did perfect would you mind saying a few

25
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,879
words in the mic yeah thank you Sage

26
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:13,940
uh yeah just uh little things just um

27
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:20,220
usually on my walking commute to work if a car would

28
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,260
stop and as I walked past I would you

29
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,360
know give a little wave I kind of helped uh

30
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:38,220
try and remember that I did a little bit of uh an appreciation Journal as well so I

31
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,980
would write down try to do three appreciations for the day to try to

32
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:51,180
keep in those moments so I think it's a good practice I I I'm liking it

33
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:58,459
how um how is how how do you know you're liking it what are the benefits for you

34
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:10,860
uh uh well I guess difficult to say I think uh

35
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,200
I don't um

36
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,199
dwell as long or churn as long in the

37
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:28,259
uh uh bad things or or challenges that come my

38
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:35,400
way it just kind of there's this other presence there that is kind of a lighter

39
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,060
presence and allows me to um

40
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,220
uh just be um

41
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,880
generally more more positive about uh about about my days beautiful well that

42
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,240
seems beautiful yeah thank you Corey sure

43
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:06,540
anybody else I want to share any any and if not from last week when you were here at a

44
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,780
different time or any other thing from the the series that you've been doing that you found beneficial that you would

45
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,960
like to share or okay

46
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,139
great um part of the reason I ask about the

47
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:33,240
noticing the joy is that negativity bias is so strong I find

48
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:40,620
it that it's almost like people just pass over even that those practice like

49
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,199
you know um it's like the Mind loses interest so quickly

50
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,300
and the well-being it's like if you imagine doing the raft practice it's

51
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:59,039
like everybody before they even get to where you would have everybody sit around the table they're done right there's just but we could actually stay

52
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:06,660
with it we could actually spend some more time and say well what were the conditions that supported This Joy well

53
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,419
I was you know at the Sangha I had good intentions you know that various things

54
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:18,199
that we could start to really highlight for ourselves and

55
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:26,880
um so it's a mystery for me and I'm trying to I'm wanting to arouse interest in

56
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,600
this and and help people sustain so um I'm you know I have a lot of I think

57
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,960
it's so important that um which is why I'm lingering here and

58
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,860
um just really want to encourage you to think about how to help the mind take in

59
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,680
the good because it won't do it by itself not until we condition it in that

60
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,620
direction I also want to invite all of you to a

61
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,960
day-long Meditation Retreat this this Saturday from 9 30 to 4 30 there's

62
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,240
Flyers at the end of the the state the stage if you want to pick one up

63
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,460
you're welcome to come for the whole time and if you can't stay all day it's fine to come for part I'll be

64
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,800
co-teaching with kodo so if you did the intro series with us he'll be back and

65
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,099
co-teaching with me that day long um

66
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:32,220
so to start tonight I have a little bit of a quote

67
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:38,060
practice sometimes unfolds in surprising ways

68
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,979
it's actually never a straight line to any fixed goal just like life

69
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:50,360
is always a mixture of things that arise from times characterized by confusion

70
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:57,240
doubt discouragement to times of clarity joy and inspiration

71
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,460
keep practicing just keep practicing never stop practicing is sort of the

72
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:08,940
motto so it's not a straight line and uh

73
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,580
I've had this image of myself at times you know where there are times where it

74
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,620
feels like it's almost every step you could go this way or that way off the

75
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:25,919
path and it's it's sometimes it's just this constant you know attention to what's

76
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,740
happening to keep us on the path we yander off and we have to come back

77
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:40,380
but if we're really right here you can start to even see oh the mind is entertaining the compulsions the polls

78
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:47,820
and um you know so yeah yeah it's

79
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:53,360
not a straight line so

80
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:03,600
for me um one of the really supportive things to pay

81
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,180
attention to in my practice is my effort

82
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:16,440
I feel like um there's so much uh there's so so much so it's so Dynamic

83
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,480
working with effort um

84
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:28,620
no different from opening a jar right you know different can openers some are

85
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:35,040
easier some are harder some jars are easier some jars are harder if you do you know if you don't put in enough

86
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:42,660
effort the jar doesn't open if you put in too much effort you might break the jar you know there's effort in that and

87
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:48,360
and the feedback is right there the jar of the lid comes off or it doesn't right

88
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,459
um so that's a very gross kind of analogy

89
00:09:53,459 --> 00:10:00,779
but the truth is is that um there's so much effort in in just in

90
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:06,720
deciding to do something and how much effort we put into it can really impact

91
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,639
our experience of something and the practice is uh

92
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,440
no different in fact it's um a really beautiful thing to start to

93
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,560
notice and and really think about like okay how much effort am I putting in to

94
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:32,459
being aware of my breathing and and then that will change over the

95
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:39,720
course of a practice period in five minutes the amount of effort that it needs to stay with the breath

96
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,420
can change dramatically right typically if we start the practice

97
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:52,980
with a little more effort to stay with the breath stay with the breath it helps us get you know established with that

98
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,980
anchor but if we keep putting that much effort in that we start with it's too much

99
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,440
effort after a while then we start to overwork and we're over

100
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:11,040
straining and we start to get tight so there's you know a certain amount of

101
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,320
effort that's needed to get started and then we need to back off

102
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,399
and then sometimes we'll back off a little too much and we'll start to wander and lose our focus and then we

103
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:30,139
need to notice that okay then maybe we need to kind of bring back a little bit more effort

104
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,000
so for me um there's there's that kind of effort

105
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,980
there's also the practice we're doing is an effort so choosing the

106
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:50,459
um anchor is an effort we choose an anchor right in this practice

107
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:55,740
and that's that takes effort in choosing the right anchor is an effort right it's

108
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:02,220
all like doing loving kindness practice is a certain kind of effort

109
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:09,180
so how were even the mindset or the tone of voice in the mind

110
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:16,019
is part of what affects the effort so I'm going to invite you all

111
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:21,899
Just Close Your Eyes for a second and in silence in your own mind I'd like

112
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,880
you to say your own name

113
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,180
just say it a few times and just sort of see if you can't notice how

114
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,779
it feels and what you notice in your body when you hear your own name

115
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,360
okay now I'd like you to um

116
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,300
think about somebody who adores you could be a pet

117
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:09,000
child grandparents somebody alive somebody from the past it doesn't matter but

118
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,820
somebody that you know really thinks you're you know they're pretty smitten with you

119
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:20,220
and I'd like you to imagine hearing your name in their voice

120
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,320
just a few times and notice what that feels like in your

121
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,500
body

122
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,440
okay and did you feel the difference

123
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,779
could you feel the difference inside of yourself

124
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:03,240
I see some slight nods yeah so this is a great kind of

125
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,779
um example of the subtleties that we can start to pay attention to with effort

126
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:17,639
the ways we can start to tune in to how we're bringing ourselves to this cushion

127
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:23,700
you know if we aren't careful we can bring the voice of an irritated parent

128
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,399
to you know the experience of sitting right to ourselves and then that's going to

129
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:37,220
have an effect our system will respond to that way of being spoken to right

130
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:51,060
so when we talk about effort and the practice we often use words two words

131
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:58,399
skillful and unskillful to describe

132
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:05,519
how habits thoughts decisions practices lead to you know suffering or

133
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:13,920
the end of suffering and so but this these terms you know

134
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:23,360
this term skillful and unskillful we really are tuning into how it's supporting our ability to be present

135
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,980
and we need to be seeing ourselves as our instrument

136
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:38,639
so the tone of voice the amount that we're encouraging ourselves the way the practice will we're like a bell it will

137
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,160
resonate and have different tonal impacts

138
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:49,800
so we want to look for things that are skillful meaning they support

139
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,800
you know our awareness being present wisdom being present

140
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,800
and uh our mindfulness

141
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:11,579
so we're using our effort as we grow this practice to monitor our inner life

142
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:17,100
Joe was talking to me earlier about you know monitoring how she's thinking right

143
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,940
in daily life and um and this so this is this is wise effort to try and monitor but then if we

144
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:29,279
over we're in the middle of life trying to work or talk to somebody and

145
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,560
if we're over trying to you know over efforting

146
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:42,180
what's what's going to happen for us we can't keep functioning because we're

147
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:49,139
over analyzing ourselves right so

148
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:54,899
and we use the effort to Monitor and

149
00:16:54,899 --> 00:17:00,019
sort of check in on our intentions what are our intentions here

150
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:09,900
and then um I like to talk about um the feedback I like the word feedback or

151
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:15,540
outcome but I like feedback best is it's like that's the the resonance that's the

152
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:22,558
impact of what we're doing what is the feedback that we're getting from our effort are we not just doing something but

153
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,380
actually paying attention to the impact of what we're doing

154
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:37,260
so there's these they call them four teachings on four kinds of effort

155
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:44,700
and there's essentially you know two two parts of it one has to do with preventing or

156
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,360
stopping unwholesome or unskillful

157
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:57,720
experiences thoughts practices and the other is to grow or to sustain the

158
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,880
skillful so we wanna if if we're noticing a lot

159
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,360
of hatred come up and self-hatred come up or something like that

160
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,799
we have four you know there's there's stop the hatred

161
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:21,440
right and then once the hatred is stopped we want to prevent it from arising again

162
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,020
and so we can start with trying to stop the hatred and then preventing it or we can actually

163
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:33,720
turn away from the hatred and grow something that's wholesome some love or

164
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:41,100
kindness or compassion and then sustain that compassion that whole that

165
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,520
um you know skillful

166
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:54,240
so we don't always have to focus on stopping something that's unskillful we

167
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:01,320
can instead choose to grow something that's skillful just abandon essentially the unskillful

168
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:07,440
as opposed to trying to just repress or stop something

169
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,660
sometimes it works to just be like no that doesn't feel good I'm done and

170
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:18,660
there's just a stopping that happens it's a really simple really clear

171
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,240
sometimes it's really easy but sometimes I find that when there's something I'm

172
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:31,620
doing that is a problem for me I actually can reinforce it if I stay focused on it then start criticizing

173
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:36,980
myself for doing this thing and it feeds it more

174
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,780
sometimes if I'm practicing loving kindness and I'm so I'm growing and then

175
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:54,260
sustaining a skillful practice mind state

176
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,720
um I might find that I'm

177
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:09,059
maybe I'm I'm I start to do something unskillful at the same time like

178
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:15,980
um I don't know maybe I start to get interested in my phone

179
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:23,220
and um that and so that's not you know that's not skillful that's not going to

180
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:30,000
support the cultivation of loving-kindness or my practice so

181
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,539
that might be something that I I truly want to stop I might if my phone is Within Reach I might literally want to

182
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:42,179
turn it off or put it away and then it's sort of done right if I

183
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:47,340
can do something that's that simple it might be just really easy to to stop

184
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:54,000
when I'm cultivating or working on sustaining something that feels

185
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,740
supportive helpful

186
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:09,960
says trying to get the mind more interested in what is happening is wise effort

187
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:17,160
so helping us be curious and interested is wise effort so it's so there's so

188
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:24,539
much to it here right there's really it's a very rich territory

189
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:29,880
and curiosity is really supportive for the practice having a mind that's

190
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:36,659
interested really interested and what what it's like a you know a kid

191
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:46,740
who's really curious about what happens if I put two more drops of dye in this you know they're so engaged you know and

192
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,900
so sometimes I that kind of mindset where we really want to stay with it and

193
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:58,700
see and find it fascinating now too much of that is not good either

194
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:12,059
I think a lot of times it's almost similar to maybe the thing I was talking about earlier about noticing Joy

195
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:19,980
it's almost like we're much more interested in in the creation of the effort and the doing than in caring

196
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:27,059
about what happens like so much more of our pattern is to

197
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:35,299
pay attention to that the launching and not what it's really like to ride in the boat

198
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,179
so I think that we get in trouble with

199
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:47,700
ourselves with our practice and in relationships because of this as well

200
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:54,900
I think that noticing and sort of paying attention being attuned to this the idea

201
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,700
of a bell you know the resonance

202
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,179
and and feeling into the space between yourself and others is really powerful

203
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:11,600
important and within ourselves

204
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:18,000
I think another thing that can happen is that we can have a sense of wanting to

205
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,720
avoid like oh I hope that didn't come out the

206
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,179
wrong way right we say something or do something we

207
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:35,520
don't want to cause more difficulty and

208
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,980
and then there's a tendency to then want to kind of Turn away and deny and move

209
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:47,580
on so that we don't have to pause and take in what the impact that

210
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:53,299
we of something that's happened that didn't quite go the right way

211
00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:01,020
so we there's a conditioning there it's back to this idea that we're not

212
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:07,799
staying tuned in to the impact of what we're doing because one it's not that important or two we

213
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:15,120
don't like what we don't want to we don't feel embarrassed we don't want to cause more of a mess or

214
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,159
but it doesn't always mean even we have to

215
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,860
say something but it is important I think it's important to to pay

216
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:31,980
attention even if it's just in ourselves to give

217
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,980
it some space to hold some space and so we don't always know how we're

218
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,020
impacting other people but we can notice how we're being impacted so maybe even

219
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:50,340
it's like oh well now I'm worried that what I said wasn't okay but they seem fine but I'm

220
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:57,780
not okay I got worried why am I worried so there's something there for us to to

221
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,080
see

222
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,860
so before I kind of go any further

223
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,500
I'm wondering what thoughts you're having about this what associations what questions

224
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,840
what ideas you might be having about effort in your practice and what

225
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:30,380
you're noticing is anybody open to sharing

226
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:42,480
hi Myla um the effort part I find that really interesting because when I meditate I

227
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,700
sometimes I'm really there and and giving it yeah

228
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:52,860
an even amount of effort and other times a whole half hour goes by and I don't

229
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:58,200
really know what I was doing I mean I catch myself in somewhere in there but I

230
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:04,980
love I like it's really important to um to put forward effort and why am I

231
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:11,039
sitting for a half hour if I'm not going to actually meditate and and focus on that anchor that you talked about

232
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,740
whatever it might be um and then when you were talking that's the one

233
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:22,880
thing uh um when you were talking about like the voices or

234
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,460
my thought you know I sometimes I have thoughts they obviously aren't necessarily always in line with who I

235
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:35,820
want to be or or how I might say something to someone but I've heard over and over again maybe

236
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:42,840
become friendly with it rather than go for the wise versus the unwise or and

237
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:48,480
so you know just today it was like oh yeah I hear you you know like and just

238
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,179
acknowledge it because it's coming from somewhere it's not necessarily what I want to do yeah but that made me think

239
00:26:54,179 --> 00:27:02,340
about how I can respond to something like that if I'm aware of it at the moment yeah absolutely that's and and

240
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:10,080
um Myla um the sometimes that is the most skillful

241
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,740
thing we can do it dissipates everything right not give it much attention you

242
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:23,760
know just acknowledge and yeah I mean I could go on and on and say oh that again or you know whatever it might be but

243
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,980
like yeah hey I hear ya yeah yeah it's more like give it some kindness or love

244
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:35,340
Yeah and sometimes it's uh you know we'll play with it because sometimes

245
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:40,620
what we'll find is the response the response is what's going to tell us

246
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:47,580
what's next because sometimes you'll find then it grows because there's something that wants attention and you

247
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:53,100
know and then we might have to respond in a different way and sometimes it's just going to dissipate but this is the

248
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:59,880
thing to pay attention to is what is the impact of our effort what happens

249
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:07,320
and yeah anything else you want to share yeah but it's beautiful Reflections and

250
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:14,159
anybody else have another idea or thing about effort

251
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,720
yeah great and Rose

252
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:31,500
hi good evening everyone hi Tanya um uh sometimes I feel in terms of effort I could be a bit overconfident in

253
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:39,000
what I'm doing and then all of a sudden you know 30 minutes does go by and then I'm like wait what was I doing or I'm

254
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,720
not even really focused on or maybe I thought my anger was on the breath and then I stopped paying it stopped paying

255
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,779
attention to it and then like the following day at work I'm like well I I had a really good sitting

256
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:57,120
or what I thought was a good sitting and then I'm I'm All Fired Up and calling

257
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,580
home calling kids houses and writing referrals left and right and

258
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:08,220
I'm just like why why can't I be okay with this I

259
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:14,520
thought I would I was on track with my meditation and I guess my effort maybe

260
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:22,380
the voice that I was listening to was a one that was laced in criticism rather

261
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:28,340
than rather than one that was of of loving kindness you know

262
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,720
that's beautiful yeah

263
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:44,039
I'll tell another little story um and somebody else if you're thinking

264
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:50,940
of something great but um I one place I've been watching the impact of effort is swimming I'm a

265
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:56,640
swimmer and um you know when you swim

266
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,460
it's a whole different thing to try and speed up because it's all about moving

267
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:08,820
your legs harder and your arms faster but also pulling harder it's a very different thing than

268
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:15,720
pushing something right because you're the water the consistency of the water is really different and so for me

269
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:21,600
um there there is a concerted amount of effort when I'm trying to increase my

270
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,539
Pace when I'm trying to get myself to move up a bit that starts to happen but what I notice

271
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:32,940
is that if I'm not careful I feel like what happens so I love to swim I love

272
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:39,899
the water I love the light in the water the feeling in of being in the water the

273
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:47,640
smoothness of it the you know just there's just so much that I love about it and when I'm putting in a lot of

274
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:55,679
effort it's like a hood comes down over my head and I I stopped seeing all these things

275
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,140
I stopped taking in the light I stopped taking in the feeling of the water I

276
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:08,640
stopped feeling the joy of swimming and so there's this real Balancing Act

277
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,220
of needing to work harder while trying to open up at the same time

278
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:21,059
so I just shared that as another example of how we need to be mindful of our effort because when we're trying hard

279
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:29,520
it can for me it feels like literally pulling pulling a hood down over my head

280
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,980
in a way like I just instead of being open like this

281
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,080
and and I felt like that has happened to me in meditation too where I'm all I'm

282
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:48,000
doing is focusing on trying so hard I'm not actually really paying attention to much of anything other than I'm trying

283
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,140
so you know as we start to watch this we might be able to have a relationship

284
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:01,080
with a certain feeling that comes in our body when we're trying too hard

285
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,960
when we're putting in too much effort and conversely when we're not putting in enough

286
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,778
you know there can be yeah Corey

287
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:20,640
[Music] yes oh we should yeah yes yes this is such a

288
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:27,659
great yeah and um sure Brian do you want to go over and to

289
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:33,659
the heat thing or um it feels like people are getting a little bit cold that maybe needs to be no you're okay

290
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:38,820
yeah okay all right if anybody's getting cold Jim can just let Jim know and he

291
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:46,620
can bump it up a teeny bit but we're all okay right now I guess Jim all right okay sorry uh no it's okay uh yeah the

292
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:51,740
metaphor I've heard before is that of uh with one's practice um

293
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:59,100
uh that of tuning a guitar string yeah uh if it's too loose uh the note is a

294
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:05,399
little um uh sour or uh and if it's too taut

295
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:10,860
you know the string can break or so you want it in tune where it's kind of

296
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:17,279
humming along absolutely yeah there's a suit uh um all about this it's such a great suta

297
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,559
but yeah if it's too that you know the string gets really the sound doesn't

298
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:30,059
vibrate right it does it just if the string is too tight it's like trying to ring the spell when

299
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:36,899
I'm holding it it just blocks the sound from vibrating and

300
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:44,159
um yeah and if there's too much it's too slack it's like you know so yeah it's this is another

301
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,799
very beautiful simile for helping us think about the effort that we're putting in and where the where the

302
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:54,840
instrument we're playing here folks we're we're the instrument and we've got

303
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:02,820
to tune in to what the impact is of what we're doing yeah yes and Rose

304
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:07,980
great how do you thank you Corey that was a really great

305
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:14,820
point I just how do you know when you're too taught or it's too slack right I mean obviously

306
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:20,398
there's tension I know that great and then maybe apathy if I'm feeling like

307
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:26,339
whatever it doesn't matter I'll just move try to move on yeah like

308
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:32,878
that yeah yeah absolutely so watching the subtle the body tension is one so

309
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:41,280
you know you know we might sort of find ourselves completely slumping or just sort of

310
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,858
losing losing a sense of uprightness right

311
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:53,580
um now you know we're all bodies are going to look a little different so it's not like we're all going to look the same but we'll know our own selves right

312
00:34:53,580 --> 00:35:00,300
but the other part is tension to like our shoulders are tense our Jaws

313
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:06,780
are gripping right um our gosh I don't know about you but

314
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:13,020
my my shoulders will come up to my ears or my eyebrows will get super tight when

315
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:18,420
I'm trying to concentrate sometimes and these are all this is all feedback that

316
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:25,700
I'm over efforting I'm efforting in the wrong way so we've we're going to have our own

317
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:31,440
conditioning our own body patterns that will give us feedback about over under

318
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,560
efforting and the tone of voice in our minds the

319
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:44,040
word choices the rapidity of the speaking in our heads the these are all

320
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:52,520
forms of feedback right yes yeah thank you so

321
00:35:52,610 --> 00:36:00,540
[Music] okay so um in in general the things that you

322
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:07,619
know tend to be important to think about are relaxation is actually really really

323
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:15,060
important so we start sitting up and finding a good posture we start with

324
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:20,160
setting an attention and working to establish our connection with the the

325
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:27,060
anchor and we've got to it's like they say the bones are upright and then they'll let

326
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:32,880
the muscles fall off the bones let the belly hang out

327
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,900
so there's this combination of upright and relaxed

328
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,880
and you know for me another big thing is paying attention to my chest it's

329
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,460
important for me to open up my squeeze my elbows together lift my shoulders up

330
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:55,500
and back because this counters the Leaning forward with the computers and

331
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,599
the phones and then the body can breathe more easily it just naturally takes

332
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:09,180
easier breaths so this is a this is an example of taking effort to help with our ease

333
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:17,460
you know to help us relax in the practice is setting ourselves up physically before we come in

334
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:24,359
um the other thing that's really supportive you know I read that quote by um aside

335
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:30,119
but um trying to get interested is wise

336
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:36,599
effort curiosity interest that's very helpful like saying you know

337
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:43,680
I'm interested in learning about what's Happening Here I'm interested in noticing well what

338
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,720
happens if I start my practice this way and then oh well what happens if I start

339
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:55,579
it that way let me see what happens so that also helps setting the sense of

340
00:37:55,579 --> 00:38:02,880
intention to notice right this intention to notice

341
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,000
um

342
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:14,339
and actually relaxation it's like another word for that might be

343
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:21,060
receptivity so you know how for two two braced

344
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:28,020
too much effort there's no receptivity and practice requires a lot of

345
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:33,900
receptivity there's a lot of Need for Attunement and receptiveness being

346
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:39,480
willing so that relaxation really supports that happening

347
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,980
all right um

348
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:52,200
so I'm just going to go over a couple other little tips that can help in practice and then we'll do some small

349
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,420
groups in terms of effort with thinking when

350
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:05,160
thinking becomes really strong one of the things that we teach um is to instead of staying focused on

351
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:11,579
the content of the thought notice the way you're thinking

352
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:18,300
thinking in words thinking in typed out words versus

353
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:24,180
hearing thinking in images memories

354
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:32,880
noticing if it's in color or black and white so start to just kind of one way is to

355
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,780
say oh this kind of thinking is happening right now and sort of see that as opposed to

356
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:47,400
attending to the content of the thought another is to just kind of uh grossly

357
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:53,940
categorize the type of thinking that's happening worry planning

358
00:39:53,940 --> 00:40:02,640
wanting remembering just these very simple categorize categories that help us again

359
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:09,720
shift from the content which is a little bit like when you plug your your CD into

360
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:16,560
the TV the VCR hold these and it grabs it and it starts rolling it's kind of

361
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:24,180
kind of when we stay with the content we get grabbed and pulled into the story Into the movie more easily so this is a

362
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:31,260
an example of how to redirect your attention to know that you're thinking but without kind of getting carried

363
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:37,500
Downstream and then another example of a really

364
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:43,680
skillful practice when there's a lot going on for us in our minds or

365
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:52,800
difficult emotions is doing loving kindness practice is doing the phrases that um

366
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:58,320
you can do them for myself so for me I they can do them for somebody else you

367
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:05,760
or all beings or categories of beings and it's essentially four phrases may I

368
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,040
be safe may I be happy

369
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:17,119
may I be healthy and may I be at ease

370
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,859
and we just gently repeat these phrases over and

371
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:28,500
over in the mind and that can help settle things as well

372
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:36,540
I can also it'd be it's like that effort of arousing good States skillful states in

373
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:42,920
the mind and then sustaining them so that part of that effort of arousing

374
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:48,240
and sustaining all right

375
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:54,420
so let's do groups of one two three one two three yeah three perfect

376
00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:02,099
and um maybe three to four so sage and Jim can join a group if they wish

377
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:08,099
um and I generally encourage you to get in a group with new people that you don't

378
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:13,500
know um and yeah go ahead and just

379
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:21,619
turn your bodies and make yourselves comfortable and get seated and I'll give you some more instructions in a minute

380
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,079
is

381
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:57,079
Okay so have you all said your names to each other great

382
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,180
great so

383
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:12,960
um I think I'll give you the option let me maybe just see I'll do a show of hands

384
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:19,079
I was thinking about having you do this one particular question in a repeating

385
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:24,420
practice a repeating way it's like one question and you keep answering that

386
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:30,240
same question over and over again letting whatever different answers come up

387
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,400
and the question that I had in mind was if I keep practicing no matter what if I

388
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,460
keep practicing dot dot dot so it might be I will

389
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:47,760
and you're going to have words to say or um something will happen you know just sort

390
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:55,079
of letting your mind free associate and kind of offer what would happen if

391
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:01,140
you keep practicing does that feel like where does that feel like something you

392
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:07,319
could engage with right now is that relatable question for you all

393
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:12,318
I see mostly head knotting okay

394
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:20,040
yeah if I if I keep practicing no matter what if I keep practicing no matter what

395
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:26,960
and so um one person at a time would share

396
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:32,220
and um can you each have group have a time

397
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:39,020
keeper great

398
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:45,300
two minutes per person so you're going to answer that same question for two minutes long

399
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:51,060
and so one person in the group who's not the time keeper can ask the question

400
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:58,560
and you just ask it and let them answer and when they stop pause and then just answer ask the same

401
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:04,079
question again and then just wait and and then at the end of two minutes you'll switch to the

402
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,900
next person and you might need to change roles okay is that clear great

403
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,338
okay begin

404
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,780

thank you thank your song members for their kind openness and attention and

426
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,880
Sage should I hit record now or you want to hit it or okay

427
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:33,599
so just for the recording the question was if I keep practicing no matter what

428
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:39,540
over and over again we're asking the same question to see what different answers come up

429
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:45,540
and um I'm curious if anyone wants to share how

430
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:51,319
that was what the what they learned or

431
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:03,660
hi it wasn't so much a little closer to

432
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:10,319
your mouth okay it wasn't so much what I was thinking it was after I it

433
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:17,160
was my turn and I looked back and I'm thinking oh my life is hanging by my

434
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:25,440
meditation practice I feel that my life has gone to miraculously change if I stay on this

435
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,480
path and so I was just splurting out till these positives

436
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:37,680
and then as I sat back I'm like I'll say if it doesn't happen yeah

437
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:46,640
yes and and then you know what happens when it doesn't happen exactly that way

438
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:53,640
and you keep practicing yeah thank you Joe

439
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,779
anybody else want to go

440
00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:07,200
because it won't you know Joe it won't go exactly the way you think it right nothing does life is too

441
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:13,680
unpredictable so nothing else you guys I heard overheard a few nice things that were

442
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:21,300
very inspiring Ben okay so I mean the option of all the things that we said was just

443
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:26,720
like living a life fully awake

444
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:32,579
as opposed to asleep

445
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:40,920
well half sleep half sleep yes yeah oh Mitra wants to share thanks

446
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:46,380
yeah we all said really good things will happen if we keep practicing

447
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:52,200
so I think there's no there's no reason not to practice

448
00:57:52,200 --> 00:58:00,540
and I think a little bit of those things are already happening like very little let's hear it

449
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:06,720
Mitra let's hear it oh just a little bit of kindness just I mean tiny tiny bit

450
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:12,180
nobody else would realize but I do I don't think you're the only

451
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:19,078
one that would realize me yeah beautiful beautiful

452
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:25,980
anyone else want to share anything that was surprising even that came out of their mouths they were a little bit

453
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:30,079
surprised by by what came out

454
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:40,520
is it still on okay sorry

455
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:53,040
hello okay I was driving across the bay bridge this morning and it was very crowded

456
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,880
and

457
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:09,000
I think the battery is out because it turned off so I don't think that was you maybe a different mic

458
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,780
hello thank you so um the only thing I was I was

459
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:20,940
thinking normally let's say 10 years ago

460
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:26,040
I would be zipping in and out of that traffic trying to take out any little

461
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:31,079
space in that road and maybe I'll get there five minutes

462
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:37,920
faster maybe not I don't know but I would try my damnedest but I just sat there wow and I thought

463
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:43,140
imagine these are all your brothers and sisters on this road

464
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:48,540
and you just that's all they are beautiful then anyway so thank you

465
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:53,540
practicing no matter what that's beautiful

466
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:03,480
okay so um let's do I was going to do guided

467
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:10,260
meditation love and kindness practice kind of give you an experience of that

468
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:16,680
and I'm wondering if you want me to save some time for

469
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:22,260
some Reflections afterwards or you'd rather have a longer meditation

470
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:28,079
so I mean I can say five minutes four four minutes

471
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:33,119
um and do a little longer practice so um

472
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:38,160
people want that little longer meditation or you want a little more

473
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:43,200
extra time for feedback and comments so if you want more more meditation

474
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:49,440
raise your hand if you want more time for feedback and Reflections raise your hand

475
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,660
so one two three three okay I got three hands up from the second okay so how

476
01:00:54,660 --> 01:01:00,359
about we do 15 minute meditation 10 minute um right okay

477
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:05,520
great so here we go we're starting with the

478
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:14,220
effort of finding our bodies in this present moment so move around a little bit

479
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:21,859
you know adjust your posture see if you need to stretch a little bit

480
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:32,760
and invite your awareness to come inward come inward

481
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:38,460
start to feel the support of the cushion or the chair

482
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:46,380
floor feel yourself maybe giving

483
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:52,520
your weight to your bones and to the chair the cushion

484
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:01,339
and see if the breath doesn't rise up right in the middle of it

485
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:18,500
so we talk about finding an anchor that helps us stay here

486
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:27,000
most frequently we use the breath but you can choose a different anchor so

487
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:33,780
whatever your anchor is breath sound sensation

488
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:45,000
taking a moment to be curious and interested about how you're

489
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,579
experiencing your anchor at this moment and this body

490
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:53,599
at this time

491
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:15,440
and if you're having a bit of a challenge connecting with your anchor

492
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:22,079
you might try taking three longer slower deep breaths just some big nice deep

493
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:29,280
breaths inviting a relaxation and a letting go with the

494
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,640
exhale

495
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:15,359
so remember the sound of the voice that you chose for

496
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:21,960
hearing your name earlier the one that says it with care and

497
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:30,359
acceptance and kindness see if you can find that voice in your

498
01:04:30,359 --> 01:04:38,460
mind and your body and whether it's in your own voice sound

499
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:46,920
or in theirs offering the phrases to yourself

500
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:52,280
with that energy that heart

501
01:04:55,460 --> 01:05:00,540
remembering that this practice of loving kindness

502
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:06,900
it's a practice where we are not trying to make something happen

503
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:15,140
rather it's all said with this may I or may you or may we

504
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:21,299
so it's almost like an invitation that we're dropping into our own system

505
01:05:21,299 --> 01:05:27,839
to the universe so we'll do that with that voice of

506
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:31,099
kindness of care

507
01:05:34,619 --> 01:05:39,780
and you can start with offering it to yourself and if you find that it's

508
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:45,780
really uncomfortable then bring to mind somebody who's so easy to love

509
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:51,180
and imagine there them there in front of you and you can offer the phrases to

510
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,420
them

511
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:02,000
so what we're doing is starting where it's easiest for us

512
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:10,079
and so this is an example of effort and then paying attention to the impact of

513
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:17,640
our effort so if we offer to ourselves and we notice there's resistance and

514
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:23,819
difficulty we're noticing and receiving the impact of our practice

515
01:06:23,819 --> 01:06:28,980
and then maybe shifting to something another easier being for ourselves

516
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:34,940
tonight and the phrases start

517
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,838
may I be safe

518
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:51,680
just taking a moment to hold that idea of safety safeness safe enough

519
01:06:54,720 --> 01:07:01,700
maybe noticing in this present moment if there's a sense of safeness

520
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:10,460
how do we know when we're feeling a sense of safeness

521
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:18,079
what happens in our bodies when we feel safe enough

522
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,578
may I be safe

523
01:07:50,819 --> 01:07:58,079
may I be happy this is that sort of Happiness that's

524
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:03,539
not dependent on other things sort of a simple

525
01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:07,940
simple happiness just a sense of

526
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:16,579
ease or Joy that's so subtle sometimes

527
01:08:20,699 --> 01:08:29,900
maybe bringing to mind an experience of feeling just a contented happiness peaceful happiness

528
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,620
may I be happy

529
01:09:13,739 --> 01:09:21,198
may I be healthy as healthy as I can be

530
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:30,960
just connecting with that feeling of health and vitality well-being

531
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:38,940
may I experience well-being

532
01:10:05,699 --> 01:10:08,960
may I be healthy

533
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:32,000
may I be at ease may I be at ease

534
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:37,698
and what does ease feel like

535
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:56,420
may I be at ease

536
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:31,140
now we'll repeat the phrases and you can take a moment to decide if you

537
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:35,658
want to continue to offer the phrases to yourself

538
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:43,020
or maybe to another human being you know that could use some support care

539
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:49,800
was having a hard time maybe somebody who's easy to love

540
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:55,920
a pet maybe all beings in the world may be

541
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:05,300
connecting with what it would be like for every single human living being

542
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:15,260
so I'll use the word we for whatever we is and you

543
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,159
may we be safe

544
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:38,300
may we be safe

545
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:52,340
may we be happy

546
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:09,980
may we be happy

547
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,780
may we be healthy

548
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,020
may we be healthy

549
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:15,260
may we be at ease

550
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:34,400
may we be at ease

551
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:48,360
may all beings everywhere without exception

552
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:56,280
be safe be happy be healthy

553
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:00,020
and be at ease

554
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:17,359
[Music]

555
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:37,519
so we have um you know we have 10 minutes

556
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:44,280
I had a little fantasy and that fantasy would be pretty simple

557
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:51,179
I think that actually the only person that would be a little hard to reach would be or no but that we take the

558
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:56,400
microphone and we pass it from each person

559
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:03,780
just you know go and you can say whatever you want to say as we wrap up this four week series and we'll be

560
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:09,540
starting another one next week called let's talk about practice and

561
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:16,260
um so you know what do you want to give to the Sangha to yourself

562
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:21,960
um if you want to ask a question fine but um Sage maybe you could start and then

563
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:28,860
pass it to Ben yeah so um I think what I'd like to give

564
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:36,719
you this first of all is just gratitude gratitude Tanya and gratitude to all of you it's

565
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:41,880
been wonderful practicing together thank you so much for

566
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:48,900
teaching I hope to apply it and to get to what if you keep practicing

567
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:53,658
without exception someday soon

568
01:16:55,739 --> 01:17:01,880
and maybe say your name this has been um

569
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:10,620
um I've attended many different classes not as much as Mitchell but some

570
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:14,940
uh over the years and

571
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:22,620
[Music] um the effect of each of each class is very subtle

572
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:29,239
um and you wonder well what did I learn

573
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:38,100
then as you live your normal life you begin to see Snippets little bits of

574
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:44,640
pieces bits and pieces of which any kind of makes you hopeful that

575
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,900
maybe I did learn something

576
01:17:51,659 --> 01:17:56,880
great and then just make sure you get animals behind you yeah

577
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:01,880
I feel the same I feel it it's

578
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:09,360
it's subtle but it's adding um and I want to thank you for these four

579
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:14,820
weeks and something happened today

580
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:20,640
um when you said to hear the voice of a person

581
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:26,880
um I think I don't know if this is going to go away but something in my heart

582
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:34,880
changed I don't think I ever said my own name or heard my own name

583
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:40,080
like this before and uh

584
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:46,679
I heard it in my dad's voice and it changed everything yeah it just

585
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:52,679
changed everything I how I feel about the whole world changed

586
01:18:52,679 --> 01:18:59,900
when we did this loving kindness I don't think I ever felt so much

587
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:10,920
and today is four years since he passed away oh but I don't think that I just um

588
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:18,140
hearing his his voice thank you

589
01:19:22,199 --> 01:19:28,080

592
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:44,340

593
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:51,960
it your patience is is something that I have to practice and sitting just

594
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:58,080
sitting and being with the breath and and just not allowing myself to

595
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:04,679
be you know over you know what do you call it like the boat in the water you

596
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:11,580
just completely carried out yeah carry it out and I I can drop the anchor Yeah because sometimes I'm holding it yeah

597
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:18,780
and I'd rather be swept away by everything and I know I I know there's a better way to live life and just many

it could use some softening so um and that was a a

610
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:51,900
the distinction between first um calling your name and then like

611
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:59,760
imagining somebody that's um likes you say your name uh it helps

612
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:08,000
me realize that and um I think that pervades a lot of uh

613
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:15,840
my being in the world is that inner voice so it's a really important

614
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:22,199
um Focus focal point to

615
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:29,400
to study and and I guess you start with accepting and

616
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:34,520
then I don't know move on um just um

617
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:39,900
noticing is is where I'm at right now so I think that's good

618
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:44,940
Corey Myla hi

619
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:52,380
um I didn't know what to expect and I knew I was coming on the last night I thank you all for uh you know accepting me in

620
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:57,600
tonight and I got the feeling that there was a real sweetness here and uh

621
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:03,900
a nice Sangha you know and um I I benefited by it tonight

622
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:11,699
um I've been here many times but in person only twice recently so I'm looking

623
01:23:11,699 --> 01:23:19,260
forward to the all day on Saturday and thank you for sharing so deeply tonight

624
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:25,860
um and uh what else I just feel like there's just so much

625
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:32,760
like a Common Thread in in why we end up in meditation and what we want in life

626
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:39,500
as as human beings so it was great to share that with you all thanks

627
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:47,699
hey everyone I'm Richelle um thank Danielle for teaching the class um thank you uh

628
01:23:47,699 --> 01:23:53,480
the the community it was very nice getting to know everyone and hearing

629
01:23:53,480 --> 01:24:01,520
your thoughts as well I think for me the series has been um

630
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:08,960
sometimes challenging but also it has been very useful in actually forming

631
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:14,280
advancing the meditation practice especially in the sense that

632
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:21,780
um certainly I'm more observant of many of the tools that you know we

633
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:30,300
discussed here in states of mind that we discussed here like the inner voice like the different types of resistance that

634
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:37,679
we experience in trying to be mindful and a lot of conditioning which is very

635
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:43,739
subconscious and it pretty much like affects everything so

636
01:24:43,739 --> 01:24:50,040
it's been useful yeah it's been very um good to expand my practice thank you

637
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,699
thank you

638
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:02,699
yeah so this is my second week here it sounds like class is over or the

639
01:25:02,699 --> 01:25:07,980
session is so it's a four week series and so next week we start us a different

640
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:13,140
four-week series Diana Clark and I will be co-teaching uh like we're calling it

641
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:20,340
let's talk about practice and we'll start actually talking the first week we'll be talking about Sangha

642
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:25,640
um and we'll cover Sangha and we'll cover um

643
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:34,400
I think it's I think we'll talk about wise effort again and mindfulness and

644
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:39,540
concentration so one topic per week but it'll be structured very much like this

645
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:46,500
we'll move through the topics I'll have discussions and guided practices so

646
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:51,780
just each month kind of shifting a little bit what the theme is or how we're going

647
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:58,139
about it great yeah so this is yeah my my first time you know doing this in a

648
01:25:58,139 --> 01:26:03,540
group setting um I like it because when I'm here there's

649
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:09,000
nowhere else I need to be other than here there's really not much else of a distraction

650
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:14,699
um even just listening right to the teaching is sometimes I catch myself wondering it's

651
01:26:14,699 --> 01:26:22,739
like okay wait wait you're here go get back to it so yeah definitely just getting started but I want to

652
01:26:22,739 --> 01:26:29,520
get more into the practice of you know just being present so this has been a good start for me I

653
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,659
think great
