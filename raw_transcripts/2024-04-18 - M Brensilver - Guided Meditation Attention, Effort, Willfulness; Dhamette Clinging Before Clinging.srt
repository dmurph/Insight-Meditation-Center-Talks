1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:07,519
so uh so welcome folks

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:16,118
um yeah happy to uh to be with you so we'll uh do the usual thing

3
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:24,320
and um say a few words and we'll say it and offer some some

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,400
Reflections so

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,040
meditation involves uh directing directing our

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,920
attention it involves making effort it involves exerting a certain

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,160
kind of intentionality and

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,559
willfulness and it involves all these things and

9
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,640
yet all of those things generally

10
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:07,560
invoke a sense of self direct the sense of attentional

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,200
agency the sense of making effort sense of intentionality or

12
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:25,640
willfulness and so meditation also is about a kind of

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,920
awareness that doesn't depend on attentional

14
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:39,600
Direction it's about effortlessness the kind of deep

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,799
relaxation of a pure kind of receptivity

16
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:54,240
it's about choicelessness it's about relinquishing all sense of like

17
00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:00,439
doing all sense of willfulness all sense

18
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,439
of autonomy

19
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:10,959
really it's about all this stuff right and it's not like the self is bad and

20
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,280
and not self is is good in a way you know one of the kind

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:26,280
of effects of practice over these years is the recognition like oh yeah I'm I I really at a deep level don't

22
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,680
care how meditation goes the viscos it of self that

23
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,720
arises it's not one's right the other wrong but we we're learning

24
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,840
to um different chambers of the Mind

25
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:55,360
capacities and so yeah sometimes and I'm going to have to give instructions in about 30 seconds and I'm going to talk

26
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,720
about directing effort and marshalling the attention in one way or another

27
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,799
making choices these things and

28
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:13,040
uh and sometimes we do that so as to enter

29
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:20,599
Realms of choicelessness effortlessness the absence of

30
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:28,959
willfulness so somehow I felt inspired to say that but I really really do not

31
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,840
know how I will guide this

32
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,439
meditation but uh we will practice one way or

33
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,640
another so find uh find a posture that

34
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,239
uh feels

35
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,760
sustainable e

36
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,440
self is not the last word of the Dharma nor is not self

37
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:15,840
we're not trying to Vanquish some Alter Ego in us or

38
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,560
something just studying the ways

39
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,240
that the uh intentional direction of attention

40
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:36,080
the effort we make the choices we make this can compound sense of the

41
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,680
meditator orchestrating all of it

42
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,479
so we begin by making some

43
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:30,840
choices by directing our attention by rallying our energy

44
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,000
what's the meditative anchor kind of home base for the

45
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,440
attention what's inside the circle that we draw that we call the focus space and

46
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,720
what's outside it maybe inside it is just the

47
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:01,520
sensations of breathing the rest of the world is outside it

48
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,000
maybe

49
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,319
we Marshall our effort

50
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:46,039
the effort to let go of discursive thinking when it grabs

51
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,360
us very gentle effort of directing our

52
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,720
attention spotlighting the breathing for example

53
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:38,440
sense of some measure of autonomy of choice

54
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,360
making of strategizing and

55
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,640
preference all of that's okay

56
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,600
so we establish uh some

57
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
stability

58
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

59
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

60
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

61
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
e e

62
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:36,120
maybe we give our ourself little mini Dharma pep

63
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,760
talks

64
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:56,279
reminders the wisdom it would be wise to remember

65
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
now

66
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

67
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
e e

68
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,240
it's quite natural for there to be a sense of the doer and the

69
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:55,519
deed the meditator and the object the meditated

70
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,199
the spotlight and the

71
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,639
stage the worker and the effort

72
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:40,519
and so much Dharma goodness develops along these lines

73
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,639
but we also don't want

74
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:13,360
to um miss this other dimension of

75
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:24,079
practice that uh involves this kind of deep

76
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,720
surrender of the doer and the

77
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:56,560
doing that leaves no room for the meditator to congeal

78
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,439
where matter and the mirror

79
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
merge

80
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
e e

81
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:19,600
this is not something we can

82
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,600
do the doing sense of responsibility is exactly

83
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,440
what for closing is this

84
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:45,280
possibility to the extent we do anything we

85
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,720
do surrender

86
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,720
relinquishment Trust the

87
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:17,200
silence offer ourselves up to the dma's

88
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
grace

89
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

90
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

91
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

92
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

93
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

94
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

95
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,399
e e

96
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,840
the very notion of a kind of

97
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:00,320
hierarchy not self higher than

98
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,080
self guarantees the congealing

99
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
self

100
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

101
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

102
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,200
e e

103
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:48,640
the Dharma contains so many different medicines

104
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,720
just kind of take what's offered by this

105
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
moment

106
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
e

107
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
e e

108
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,960
e

109
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:14,200
okay so uh it's good to say with

110
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,360
you

111
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:28,080
um Dharma practice we we often kind of I don't know find find a

112
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:34,480
ourselves circling back to Old loves things that maybe we put aside as

113
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,639
you're practicing or training they sort of become relevant

114
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:45,120
once again and um I was

115
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,200
remembering uh undergraduate class philosophy

116
00:31:50,200 --> 00:32:01,440
class a professor said um we're we're all IDE is in the mind of

117
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:09,799
God and they were alluding to uh a that's a phrase from uh George Barkley

118
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:18,080
1700s uh this philosophical School of idealism the the idea that uh um reality

119
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:25,799
consists exclusively of minds and their ideas no material

120
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:32,679
existence and uh that phrase you know we all ideas in the mind of God just like

121
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:40,360
did something to me and um the Buddha the Buddha was not an

122
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:47,720
idealist uh in that sense believed in in the the reality of things of people of

123
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:54,480
trees of chairs but maybe we can say in in

124
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:01,919
certain ways that the Buddha was an idealist about one

125
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:10,279
thing suffering the the core of all things the

126
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:16,039
Buddha said is Liberation the core of all things is

127
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:21,600
Liberation and the experience of of suffering is far

128
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:28,039
more plastic more fluid than a table or a chair we've taken

129
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:34,399
are suffering to be more like a chair than maybe we

130
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:42,919
should and so the dhap begins all experience is preceded by mind made by

131
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:49,799
mind led by mind and this is not the claim that the

132
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:58,600
world doesn't exist or it's all just an idea in the mind of God

133
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:04,919
it doesn't mean that but what it means is we're always we're always doing

134
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:11,240
something to experience our mind mediates all of

135
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:17,240
it as more plastic than we

136
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:26,560
appreciate and when we think about um clinging clinging this

137
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,760
kind of core problem the Buddha highlighted when we think about clinging

138
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,280
usually think about the very coarse level of clinging of very obvious

139
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,919
grasping aversion the craving for some sense pleasure or something is like very

140
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:50,040
obvious the aversion towards some unpleasantness very obvious

141
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:56,320
right but before the clinging even begins there's

142
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,920
clinging and some of what we're doing in our Dharma practice is

143
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,599
noticing the the clinging before the clinging the

144
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:15,079
clinging before the eruption of very coars level clinging

145
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:22,960
right and so maybe we we have the sense of like we're just okay I'm just sitting

146
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:29,599
here right sitting here we're waiting for the world to kind of greet us right

147
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:36,400
and there sights and sounds and and thought and uh and feeling right and

148
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,680
it's almost as if we we imagine having no mind until

149
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:48,720
there's sense contct right until something the world hits us there's no

150
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,440
mind or there's no place for clinging to arise

151
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:02,520
and so it's it's as if like the model of the world that we have are entirely

152
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:08,720
reactive they just react to incoming sense

153
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:16,200
data they're inactive or quiet and then with experience the models reactivate

154
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:24,920
right and then maybe I'll cling but are are

155
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:32,960
models never idle mind does not Idol does not Idol our

156
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:40,160
models are being reiterated Moment by moment even when it's very simple even

157
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:46,800
when there's not a lot of coarse grasping or

158
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,119
aversion right so in that that the chain of dependent

159
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:58,640
origination the the the the sequence that is often highlighted con contct

160
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:04,160
feeling craving clinging contact feeling craving

161
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:11,200
clinging but and and there's a ton of action there right and that's part of

162
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:18,359
why I think we speak about about feeling so much this kind of like

163
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:25,119
um yeah the the valance the affective arousal and

164
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:31,200
Valance but before that even happens right before

165
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:38,680
that even happens there is uh there's Sanara volitional

166
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:46,560
formations aito calls the sar's like formative

167
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:52,400
energies formative energies sar's shape

168
00:37:52,400 --> 00:38:00,359
experience they they're woven into the model we have of

169
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:08,280
experience of the world and so maybe we say that that's

170
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:17,280
the clinging before the clinging the clinging before the clinging the subtle clinging before the contact and the

171
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,040
feeling and then the more dramatic clinging that can arise after the

172
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:30,560
feeling but we're becoming as practitioners we're becoming more sens sensitive to the clinging that precedes

173
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,880
the clinging we're becoming more sensitive to the

174
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:43,760
ways our our motivations our motivations suffuse

175
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:51,119
Consciousness even before there's the coarse clinging the ways wanting and

176
00:38:51,119 --> 00:39:01,079
knowing are not strictly separable and so so just in the the

177
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:07,400
movement of our of our attention was highlighting in the sit

178
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:15,160
you know the movement of our Attention our attention is often it often functions as

179
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,359
a kind of appendage of our

180
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:26,480
wanting and so it's a profound kind of Journey it's

181
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,880
subtle work to see what is the mind doing sort of before anything happens

182
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:41,160
before we're the eruption of more uh coarse level clinging

183
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:48,560
craving and so we look what what are the effects of the kind of more

184
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,920
subtle I don't know whether we say clinging subtle clinging and shaping The

185
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:03,119
View so clinging is

186
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:11,079
um yeah just almost woven into our biology kind

187
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:17,000
of strategy for for control for

188
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,880
acquisition to to manage some s you know to just to

189
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,680
like to stay okay and is very innocent in that

190
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:40,400
way want to appreciate the innocence of that but in order to to sort of like

191
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,200
orchestrate our clinging we need to make the world more

192
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:55,599
solid everything becomes a thing and the world we sort of freeze

193
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,720
the world into things the world gets divided into that which helps that which

194
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:09,240
hinders friends and enemies and uh in that gesture the self

195
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:16,160
the sense of self becomes more uh is reified it becomes more real more

196
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:24,800
viscous more congealed and so the sense of of the

197
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:33,359
kind of this fundamental alienation of dualism is born out of clinging born out

198
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:39,720
of clinging and some of what was pointed to

199
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:46,119
in the as we're sitting right and part of uh what

200
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:52,760
meditation is about part of what our practice is about is uh

201
00:41:52,760 --> 00:42:01,240
detecting and relaxing these more subtle layers of clinging the formative

202
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:10,400
energies that uh shape the view and we start to see yeah always to

203
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:19,839
cling to cling to strategize we um we need a self

204
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:27,520
basically but Letting Go relinquishment does not

205
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:36,839
the uh third uh Zen patriarch said when the subject when the subject

206
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:44,359
disappears there can be no measuring and comparing the subject disappears there

207
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:49,280
can be no measuring and

208
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:58,880
comparing the need to make sense of the moment that need to

209
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:07,640
narrative narr to narrativize to tell a story about the moment the need

210
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:16,440
to measure and compare the need to kind of freeze experience into

211
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:23,640
language this is what begins to fall away as we relax this subtler layer of

212
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,640
clinging

213
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:39,440
and a lot of the there's no room there's no room for

214
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:49,200
so many the habits that get us into trouble we surrender there's no no impulse

215
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:58,720
towards measurement and you know comparison and evalu ation

216
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:05,720
and just everything becomes much much

217
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:11,559
simpler and wondrous wondrous we were

218
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:20,760
simultaneously disenchanted with Sam SAR but uh amazed

219
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:26,480
too and so we practice we practice

220
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,920
we'll uh we'll keep uh keep exploring

221
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:39,680
know don't let uh don't let the the heart's gesture of relinquishment become

222
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,720
ens snared in the doing of

223
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:52,839
self okay stop there offer this for your

224
00:44:52,839 --> 00:45:01,039
consideration look forward to uh being back next week
