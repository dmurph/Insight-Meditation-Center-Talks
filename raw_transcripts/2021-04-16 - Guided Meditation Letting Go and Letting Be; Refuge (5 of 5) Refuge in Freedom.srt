1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:13,360
so good day good afternoon good morning

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:22,640
good night good greetings to all of you and

3
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,320
as a introduction to this meditation

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:38,399
uh i think that buddhist practice has a strong association with letting go

5
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,160
and for some people that's inspiring for some people it's not

6
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,520
and then sometimes instead of letting go

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,640
teachers will encourage us to let be and letting be is a kind of letting go

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,920
um we're letting go of our ways in which we don't let things be the ways that we

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:12,560
want to fix them or push them away or let them go even um

10
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:20,479
or hold on to them or you know all these ways we get involved with what's happening

11
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,000
and um and letting be is a very important part of vipassana

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,320
practice especially in the deeper quieter places of meditation

13
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:40,320
but these two uh uh come together in a sense for the i think very

14
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,360
i think very significant way we have to hold these two together letting go and letting be and in this

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,840
way that we let go of what is unwholesome

16
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,680
unhelpful and we let be what is wholesome what is helpful

17
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,880
we let go of that which isn't interferes with our compassion or

18
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,239
freedom or the best qualities of who we are

19
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,480
whatever interferes with these best qualities of ourselves that we let go of that interference

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,640
so these qualities can flow through us and we let be those good qualities

21
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,760
and so learn to dis distinguish between what is wholesome and unwholesome and how to let go is part of this

22
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,800
practice and it's a little bit simplistic but we

23
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:46,160
can understand that in in the teachings of the buddha what is unwholesome always comes along with

24
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,280
craving some form or other of compulsive desire

25
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,720
and and that itself also comes along with tension or or contraction

26
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:06,080
or straining or a obscuring of our wisdom our connection to

27
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,640
ourselves there is a closing down that happens

28
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,440
that what is unwholesome is un is unhealthy in a certain way or

29
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,159
has a certain level of suffering or pain inherent in it and as we get more sensitive in

30
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,319
mindfulness we recognize more and more that underlying tension

31
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:39,040
suffering strain pain that is in the unwholesome the

32
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,400
contraction and we have a better sense of this is what we let go of

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,680
that that we let go of the tension the contraction the tightness that's around this or the pushing that's

34
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,519
around it and uh what is wholesome has a flow to

35
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:04,560
it has an opening quality to it has a sense of being nourishing or a goodness to it or

36
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,599
rightness to it that seems to flow and maybe sometimes you know maybe even

37
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,560
radiate or glow or it just feels like it's there's an ease to it and i'm closer to happiness

38
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,720
than to certainly pain and suffering and so to learn to recognize those two

39
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:30,000
and let go of the unwholesome and allow the wholesome and those are the two move

40
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,680
very important movements of this meditation practice and we can't always let go

41
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,919
and sometimes what's whole especially if we let go in unwholesome ways like we don't like

42
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,759
something i want to push it away and um and uh

43
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:57,280
and sometimes uh even with the unwholesome it's best just to let it be because if

44
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,320
it really lets something be then it lets go of itself if it's

45
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:10,080
unwholesome if it's wholesome if you really let it be it often can grow or expand or morph

46
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,280
into something more beautiful so letting be is often a wonderful practice to do

47
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,240
but at times it's quite appropriate to let go and we begin the meditation that way by

48
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,840
a version of letting go which is relaxing

49
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,199
which is letting go of the muscular tension we carry

50
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:42,800
so um assuming a posture and it allows you to

51
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:53,840
be both alert and relaxed and gently closing your eyes

52
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:01,599
and take a few moments to gentle yourself into your body

53
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,918
to gentle yourself into this living body that you have

54
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,280
to center yourself here in this body

55
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,319
as if the body is your meditation hall the body is the location

56
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:34,400
that you enter to meditate

57
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,360
and then taking a few long slow gentle in-breaths

58
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:49,840
in long extended exhales

59
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:01,039
breathing in deeply enough so that you really feel your torso expand and stretch and really feel your

60
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,879
embodied existence

61
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:17,840
and in the exhale to relax and settle into this embodied existence

62
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

63
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,319
and as you exhale to relax the muscles of your face

64
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,599
around your eyes your forehead

65
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,840
in your cheeks and your jaws

66
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:10,639
and maybe there's also a little relaxing in the mouth maybe the teeth are touching

67
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:18,160
each other firmly can you let the teeth fall away from each other just a little

68
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:41,839
bit and exhale relaxing the shoulders

69
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,399
all around the shoulders a little bit around the curve of the

70
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,839
shoulders into your lower arms

71
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:09,839
the shoulder blade area

72
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,880
and then to

73
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,839
soften in the belly

74
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,600
and as you soften in the belly simultaneously maybe you can relax your

75
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:51,839
arms and your legs a releasing of the holding in the body

76
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,760
and also perhaps relaxing any tension or contraction in the

77
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,399
mind

78
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,839
and as you do so

79
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,279
quieting your thinking

80
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:18,480
as if you have a volume knob and you can turn down the volume on your thinking

81
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:29,120
softening in the mind

82
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,800
and then as you're sitting here

83
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,480
is there anything that would be appropriate to let go of

84
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:49,440
it's not needed right now it's not useful right now

85
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,839
and maybe even it's unwholesome

86
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,600
and chances are most of your thinking is not needed right now

87
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,120
even if thinking is about thinking about good things

88
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,600
if we can let go of it maybe then you can feel or sense

89
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,720
something in within that's wholesome some embodied feeling of

90
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,160
rightness or goodness

91
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:53,839
tender care love warmth

92
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:07,839
a clear sense of honesty honest presence with what is

93
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:21,839
and from within what is wholesome becoming aware of your breathing

94
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,680
as you breathe in allowing letting be what is wholesome

95
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:39,519
as you exhale let go of what is unwholesome

96
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:49,519
or what is not necessary now just here

97
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:56,880
quieting the thinking so there's a greater

98
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:04,880
almost embodied awareness of embodied wholesomeness

99
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,800
and if it's easy enough letting go of what is unwholesome

100
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,240
and if it's not easy let it be

101
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:31,839
that is similar to just leave it alone don't be involved

102
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:56,080
to let go or to let be

103
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:21,840
which allows you to be more present here

104
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:27,840
to let go or let be that is the question

105
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:35,440
and then the time comes when the question is

106
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:44,080
what to let forth what to express and allow for to move through us

107
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,200
in the end of a meditation in the end of any significant dharma

108
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,520
activity there's an ancient long-standing tradition

109
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:04,159
to dedicate the merit and for some of us the idea of merit

110
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,200
doesn't quite

111
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:17,440
it's not quite understandable maybe but the buddha wants to find merit

112
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:24,879
as happiness so to dedicate the happiness

113
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:32,480
dedicate dedicate the benefits that have come from our meditation together

114
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:41,919
for the welfare and happiness of others to have a clear kind of opening

115
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,639
and inclusion of the world

116
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:54,000
so that with all beings may we live in such a way

117
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:02,639
that the world benefits from us and especially those who suffer

118
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:08,240
the tremendous challenges of the african-american community in this

119
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:15,600
country the challenges of the asian americans the native americans

120
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:23,039
immigrants of all kinds the poor those struggling with drugs

121
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:31,039
poverty the list goes on

122
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:37,200
may it be that our practice and our good hearts and our the goodness

123
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,559
within that we tap into the wholesomeness may we dedicate it

124
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:51,039
to making this world a better place for all beings

125
00:31:51,039 --> 00:32:00,960
may all beings be happy may all beings

126
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,399
be safe may all beings

127
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:15,840
be peaceful and may all beings everywhere be free

128
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:32,839
[Music]

129
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:46,158
so the topic this week has been refuge and uh

130
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:53,120
one of the probably most important or among the most important religious

131
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,840
sentiments of buddhists can have of course the word religion religious

132
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:06,480
doesn't kind of not in the vocabulary of some people who practice buddhism

133
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:15,200
but it is a kind of a it's associated with a deep um feeling

134
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,120
inspiration uh it's this kind of the source of inspiration or the quality of

135
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,720
inspiration that goes in the direction of

136
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:35,440
freedom goes direct of insight goes in the direction of aligning our life attuning our life with

137
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:42,320
the wholesomeness and the freedom we are discovering with the practice

138
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:50,000
with the deep sense of knowing and connectivity intimacy that comes with doing this

139
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,679
practice like here is a valuable way of living here is a valuable place from which

140
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:03,519
to be in the world that is i like to use the word deeper than

141
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,200
what happens to us when we're spinning around on the surface of things

142
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,280
and the stories and ideas and memories ideas kind of telling ourselves

143
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:22,158
preoccupations and thoughts based on our desires and fears and animosities

144
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:29,280
that to learn to let go of the spinning mind the agitated mind

145
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,800
the surface mind that we can often live in

146
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,520
and discover that there's a deep mind or deep heart that we can come from and i made that distinction between

147
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,720
wholesome and unwholesome and that one way to be taken

148
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:53,280
have refuge in action is we take refuge in the wholesome we take refuge in doing that which is

149
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,560
beneficial and for the for me the wholesome feels like

150
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:05,280
that comes from our depths the unwholesome feels like it's skimming the surface

151
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,920
of our life in our experience and it involves the surface tension and if

152
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,079
that surface tension can really relax and really allow ourselves to come from the depths then

153
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:25,520
we have something so good that it's worthwhile being our refuge

154
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,119
so what we discover through meditation practice is seen as represented by the buddha

155
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,200
dharma and the sangha and so when we go for refuge in the buddha dharma sangha

156
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:43,920
it's really a way of saying i go to refuge with the inner buddha dharma sangha that which

157
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,480
resonates with these beautiful external refuges and then

158
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,079
the buddha said make a refuge of yourself and so there's this kind of come here

159
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:02,560
don't be so looking outward and even when he you synonymously take be a refuge to yourself

160
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,920
he he then immediately followed kind of giving a synonym for that which

161
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:14,880
is uh be a refuge in the dharma and there's something about discovering the dharma within us we

162
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,240
become the dharma practice is to kind of not to make us different than who we are

163
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:27,359
or to brainwash us in some way but to free up what's most profound and

164
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:34,799
deep and meaningful so a source of support that's within us the dharma

165
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,800
and to discover in some kind of way we are the dharma when the surface tensions fall away

166
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,000
and this wholesomeness can come forth and then take refuge in our actions

167
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,599
you know be able to distinguish between wholesome and unwholesome and move in the direction of the wholesome as we do this

168
00:36:53,599 --> 00:37:00,240
the buddha talked about two other refuges that exist and the first i'd like to

169
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:06,000
mention is the four noble truths and uh and in talking about the four noble

170
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,240
truths thinking of them i think of them as first and foremost deep

171
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:19,040
insight so we live in a wholesome way we settle we settle the surface mind the tension we'd

172
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,960
be able to drop down and really find a way to be connected and intimate with this lived experience

173
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,320
with a quiet focused mind so we really begin seeing more and more clearly what's

174
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:37,200
happening here and with that we start seeing something of the underlying process

175
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:43,440
the movement the process the unfolding of how our psychological and heart mind

176
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:50,079
kind of move and operate and we see something called the

177
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:56,079
four noble truths a very rich set of concepts that has different connotations different

178
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:03,359
applications different elaborations at different times um but at the heart of it one of

179
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:09,359
one one classic way of understanding it is that we really start seeing deeply deeply

180
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:17,119
deeply how limiting it is to crave to contract to be compulsive

181
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:24,720
to lose our freedom in a drivenness in our thoughts and thinking and our emotions and our desires and our

182
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,400
aversions and to really see that thirsting that's underneath it all

183
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,480
and to be able to see the possibility of letting go to see beyond it to the freedom the

184
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:43,520
other side of it and so that we're not blinded by it thinking this is what life is and freedom is just giving in to all our

185
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,560
compulsions but we see on the other side of it something that's really wonderful

186
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:55,440
the level of peace and happiness and freedom that is possible so it's an insight

187
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,800
to see and there are other aspects of this insight but the foreign to really see this

188
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:07,440
insight that shows us another possibility so to take refuge in

189
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:15,520
that insight this is right and then the last uh refuge the buddha mentioned is that

190
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,640
uh when we have this deep insight and we realize that

191
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:28,960
or not necessarily we realize but our heart realizes the heart is given the space to really

192
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:35,520
settle in and become whole and at ease and relaxed then there's a

193
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:42,000
phenomenal letting go or releasing it's not something we do

194
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:49,359
but a releasing a stopping and ending of something three things that we say

195
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:56,000
over and over again and so because we say it and i say it so repeatedly it um

196
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,280
kind of maybe gloss over it or oh yeah yeah you know this is kind of buddhist stuff

197
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,960
but it really lays at the heart of all unwholesome behavior

198
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:13,680
and so it's so significant and that is greed hatred and delusion that

199
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,920
they get released to let go and that absence of great hate and delusion that

200
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:28,560
is a refuge and to have experienced that refuge that protection that understanding that value

201
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,800
of being without greed hate and delusion without these these deep

202
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:42,720
unwholesome tendencies is is the most powerful refuge we can have

203
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:52,079
and at the end of his life the buddha said that he had made a refuge of himself

204
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,960
uh and what that means is that he had um he had done the practice all the way to

205
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:06,160
the this complete letting go of greed hatred and delusion and delusion he had done the wholesome things that

206
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:14,720
he had really connected to something really valuable within that led him to this deep release

207
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:21,839
and in doing so he made himself a refuge for himself he made himself safe for himself

208
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:27,040
and safe from danger and that's the possibility for this

209
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:34,880
practice for us is that when we really kind of go for refuge take this refuge we

210
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:42,960
are affirming the value of doing this practice we're affirming the value of

211
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:50,079
following the eightfold path the four noble truths following the path of what's wholesome

212
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:56,960
we're affirming the value of this deep letting go of everything which is unwholesome

213
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,599
and uh and then kind of putting ourselves on that path and we do so we make ourselves our own

214
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:11,760
refuge and the further we go on the path the um the more we um we will

215
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,560
um you know be create this great inner safety and

216
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,720
there's a way in which the greatest danger we have is not externally from us the greatest

217
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:32,000
danger is what how we react and and respond to what happens to us in our this life of ours

218
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,839
that the clinging the attachment the closing down the self-criticism the ways in which we send

219
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:45,119
arrows into our own hearts and to have made the heart made ourselves safe for ourselves

220
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:54,000
that there's a place of refuge here no matter how difficult the world is around us in here is a profound abiding

221
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
refuge that comes with the absence of greed hatred and delusion

222
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,440
and then finally is um in one translation in the sutras

223
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:14,800
it's not quite right it doesn't work use the word sarana refuge but there's one translation of buddha's

224
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:22,240
teachings where where it says the buddha says make yourself a refuge for others

225
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:30,079
the literal word that's used as refuge here is safety make yourself safe for others

226
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:38,000
and with this movement then once we discover the refuge in ourselves then

227
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:46,079
then then the opportunity is there that we become someone who is safe for others and

228
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:52,839
that is a wonderful quality not enough people in our world in our society have the sense of

229
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:59,760
safety and so to let go and

230
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,200
and then be able to offer yourself as a refuge as a support as a

231
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:11,680
compassionate caring presence for others so um

232
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:20,480
refuge so thank you all for this week and just a reminder

233
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:27,680
that starting monday i'll be teaching the next week but uh the teaching will also be part of

234
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:35,040
a another program that i'm doing for san francisco zen center and we'll be joined on youtube with you

235
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,640
know the people from the zen center program and um and that

236
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,560
and so i'm not quite sure how i'll teach next week it'll be basic bipashna teachings but i

237
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:53,920
think i'll try to shape them in a way that is in harmony with zen teaching in fact

238
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:00,720
the name of the program that i'm part of is called the harmony of zen and vipassana and now you'll get

239
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,480
more of that because the in the following two weeks after that it's a three-week program

240
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:12,720
um the abbess of green gold zen center and and uh former abbot paul haller

241
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,480
fushrader and paul heller will do the 7am teachings so you'll get a whole different flavor of

242
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:25,920
practice for a couple of weeks which should be quite you know enlivening i hope

243
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:34,000
