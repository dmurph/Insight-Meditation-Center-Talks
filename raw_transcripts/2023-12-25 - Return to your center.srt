1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,640
so hello everyone is it loud enough you to hear yeah

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,400
go sometimes um the challenge of meditating before

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,600
giving a talk is that there's nothing to talk about

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,559
now so I'm thinking of the solstice which

5
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:40,719
happened a few days ago and that now we're in a sense we're

6
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,680
turning towards the the time of light and there's a saying that goes

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,920
something like we are conceived in the

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:01,359
dark and born out of the dark we are born BN into the

9
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:09,439
light and we grow in the light so there with the

10
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,320
seasons we go into the darkness and that has its own value and

11
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:23,159
now we go out for those of us in Northern hem hemisphere we go going out into the light when we

12
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,640
meditate in our tradition we tend to close our eyes so it is a rhythm of a

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,840
kind of um going into the dark and then we open the eyes and we're

14
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,799
going back out into the light and what is it that's conceived

15
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:49,079
when we close our eyes to meditate what is it that is born out of

16
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:55,960
meditation that then is Born Into the Light of our social life or work life or

17
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:02,719
lived life and not only that but grows in that light in that

18
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:11,280
life and this rhythm of going into meditation and coming out is actually a very important one where we a retreat

19
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:19,599
tradition so we put a lot of emphasis on going off on meditation Retreats and um and there's a rhythm

20
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,760
with those as well some people it's it's a yearly Rhythm maybe once a year they go and Retreat and it's important part

21
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,840
of the year is to go in there and and something shifts something changes something is touched into something is

22
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,400
born that then is brought back into the world uh and practice in the world or

23
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,560
explored in the world or applied into the world and then after a while we go back into meditation and then that

24
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Rhythm and that rhythm is something that um uh goes back to the time of the

25
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,760
Buddha when monastics who were the primary practitioners back then who do

26
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,840
lots of practice go retreats uh had a lifestyle where 3 months of the

27
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,159
year they would uh do what's called The reigns Retreat where they'd stay put in

28
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:15,159
one place in order to practice practice a lot of meditation hear teachings and

29
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:21,000
things like that and after the rains retreat they would go out into the world

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and wander around Northern India and that tradition continued in

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,560
variety of Buddhist countries and and I was told that in Korea they have that pattern where monastics would gather for

32
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:42,080
a monastery for a 3-month period of the rains and the end of those three months they all monks scatter and then they

33
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,799
come back the next time around that rhythm of coming and going when I was at the tasahara Zen

34
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,640
Monastery here in California down in down in the in Los padris National

35
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,400
Forest in the middle of it in Santa Cruz mountain in the Big Sir mountains

36
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,599
um we had that similar Rhythm where we would have the winter time we would just

37
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,599
be alone in this little Valley in the middle of the Wilderness with the river going through it practicing with a small

38
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,000
group of people and a lot of meditation a lot of silence and um and then rather than

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,560
scattering at the end of that period uh during the summer from May to Labor Day

40
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,479
in September the um would be what's called guest season

41
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:38,360
and the rather than going out into the world the world would come in and it was kind of a partly a resort and people

42
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,880
would come to a monastery to Resort and um and uh and as a

43
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,960
practitioner there I felt it was very important that Rhythm that by the end of

44
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:56,360
the winter um there was something very important about meeting all these guests in the more complicated life of the

45
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,639
guest season and uh all the social intera actions and happen there that

46
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:08,160
applying what I'd learned uh having attested by what I encountered as we

47
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,360
went through the that monast you know this worldly life of all these

48
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,639
activities and um it allowed something to grow and develop though by September I was ready

49
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,600
for the guests to go and I was ready to drop into the

50
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,560
silence again and and return to some kind of deeper place of being that was

51
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,560
the kind of the place of Genesis the place of something being conceived something being different kind of has a

52
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,600
chance to be born from that really settled place so our tradition is a retreat TR

53
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,199
tradition but regularly I've thought it's rather unfortunate that we call it them

54
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,800
Retreats and um and yesterday I looked up the atmology and the history of this

55
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,400
word retreat and um and it means it comes from French and then from Latin

56
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,039
but in French uh it meant something like uh to pull back to step backwards and it

57
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:18,280
was originally used U as a military term for the military to retreat when there

58
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,440
was a need for that in the in battle and then uh but then at some point it became

59
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:31,520
a religious term for in about the in the in the 1700s apparently a religious term

60
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,360
meant uh religious people going off pulling back from something in order to

61
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:45,199
be in seclusion to do their kind of spiritual life and then a few decades later it was it became apparently for a

62
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,440
while a term used for um um institutions

63
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,520
to house the mentally ill they they get to go and

64
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,879
Retreat and um but still this pulling away so I think

65
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:09,360
it's kind of unfortunate uh that we call it Retreats pulling back uh pulling away like you're

66
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,680
leaving something behind that my my if I could redo the English language I would

67
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,440
uh call our Retreat centers return centers not because you're returning the

68
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,039
that damaged goods but uh rather that it's a place to

69
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:34,160
return to yourself and and um because uh what what I found through meditation practice just

70
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,000
sitting here now partly why I didn't have wasn't kind of ready to speak when we

71
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,360
started was um was there's a return to a place of inner psychological Health

72
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:55,720
there's a return to a sense of Harmony everything when if it goes well in meditation it's a return in a sense to

73
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:03,400
much closer to who I fully am than how I am if I'm out about uh especially this

74
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:10,240
season out I went on the roads a few days ago and boy it was like crazy the cars and the people and the lines and

75
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:17,319
the stores and and uh actually I enjoyed myself because these in the lines because I thought this is just as good a

76
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:23,800
place to meditate as any I'll just do standing meditation here and if I can't do standing

77
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:30,039
meditation here then I probably can't do it anywhere you know I should be able to do

78
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:35,719
it here too and so I actually enjoyed it standing there and I and I kind of looked forward to next door with the

79
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:41,640
next long line and um but anyway this frazzled

80
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:49,160
kind of uh life that we can live and I I sometimes feel disconnected to some degree for myself that sometimes I only

81
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:56,320
realize when I sit down to meditate and then by meditating something begins softening and relaxing

82
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,560
and um and the fragmented quality of my life settles down and the fragments come

83
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,600
into harmony get settled and the way that the mind gets more

84
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,720
peaceful uh also it harmonizes it settles it stabilizes there's a idea of

85
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,600
unification that's part of meditation practice and this unification means everything comes together in a kind of

86
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,800
unity and when everything's in unity then no parts are working against each

87
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,959
other uh partly to make a point you can disagree you will but I want to kind of

88
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:37,680
religious people make uh hyperbole a lot so I can get away with it sometimes so

89
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,120
in case you don't like what I'm about to say uh but uh but the uh the um whenever

90
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:52,640
you're carrying around tension in your muscles you're in conflict with

91
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,480
something is that interesting idea might not be 100% true but uh it's a very

92
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,120
interesting idea that many times I think that we're in conflict with something and if we're living with that

93
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,519
tension chronically all day long week after week month after month decade after

94
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:16,440
decade uh then we're living constantly in some kind of conflict something we don't want something we're protecting

95
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:23,200
ourselves from something that we're trying to push away something some ambition we're trying to

96
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,680
attain and that and ends up a kind of alienation from ourselves

97
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:37,000
and to sit down and meditating and let the tension dissolve and relax then that sense of conflict

98
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,160
disappears and we're not we're not in conflict with any part of ourselves and this wonderful possibility

99
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,320
of breathing being alive settled here with nothing no opposition to what's

100
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,600
happening in this psychophysical being is a remarkable experience and I when I when I've

101
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,839
touched into this in clear way ways to me it feels like uh this is

102
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,600
Health this is what being healthy is like I have this issue uh one of my

103
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,920
little delusions that I sometimes comes affects me is if I get

104
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,320
sick um at some point I'm no longer really sick I'm just a little bit

105
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,480
sick I'm getting better and I'm I'm still really tired or achy or something

106
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,880
and and and my delusion is I don't want to believe I'm still sick and I'll have

107
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,120
these thoughts Gil you're probably fooling yourself you're probably not really sick and maybe this not this

108
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,880
you're a lazy or you're something you know and like I'm and then because I

109
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:55,639
can't quite tell I I can't quite believe it but then the next day oh now I'm

110
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:01,480
healthy you know this is what health is you know I really know so the same thing

111
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:08,040
psychologically spiritually we can have a sense oh now this is

112
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:15,720
health so when we go on these so-called Retreats that's the place where we

113
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:23,320
return to who we are much more and we pull back from that we

114
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:30,760
withdraw from that for whatever reason we Retreat from that when we go back into the world all

115
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:36,560
too easily and uh and so there's a loss of

116
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:43,480
ourselves and from a meditator point of view um meditation is not an altered

117
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,480
state of mind it's the normal state of mind it's the healthy State of Mind the

118
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,959
alternate State of Mind is how people are walking around in everyday life that's pretty altered full of greed and

119
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:04,880
hate and fear and anxiety and that's what's the of finding the mind and so this return so you know we

120
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,199
could call these return centers the Insight return

121
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,600
center and um and and someone says you know so you say you're you're going to

122
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,199
tomorrow you're going to start a new return as opposed to a new

123
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:28,880
Retreat it's a returning a returning and um so this rhythm of this

124
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,079
turn to something deep inside to Harmony wholeness and all that and that the

125
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:42,560
deeper kind of possibilities uh of meditation that Buddhism offers uh come

126
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:50,680
uh come from or uh arise out of this kind of return to a healthy way of being

127
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,880
being settled whole no longer living in Conflict no longer living with this

128
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,480
tension that we can often carry in our daily life and um and that's kind of that that

129
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,279
state is not the end end state for Buddhist practice but in that state of

130
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:13,600
health we can feel that there's a calling there's an onward leading nature

131
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,920
there's a way in which the heart wants to continue with something

132
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,440
profound and that profound thing that wants to be that wants to be born is all

133
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,519
kinds of things and U but what is it that wants to be born is a wonderful

134
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:36,320
question what wants to be born and and how do we allow it to be

135
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,759
born in us and that's one of the functions of meditation is to create the

136
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:48,040
room in our hearts in our minds in our body to allow something to be born that

137
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:54,120
wants to be born in out of the darkness when we go through serious

138
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,680
psychological challenges emotional challenges really depressed

139
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:07,839
really feel betrayed feel angry really feel like we've lost

140
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:14,720
something profound relief grief with anger whatever fear all these

141
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,399
difficulties that people struggle with I think there can be less

142
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:28,279
struggle around it all if we appreciate that in the right conditions in the

143
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:34,800
heart of them something wants to be born what is that what wants to be

144
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,600
born sometimes we're so reactive so caught up so judgmental so disturbed by

145
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,759
the emotions we have sometimes we even receive messages our society you're not

146
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:53,120
supposed to be this way and that makes it harder as well the meditation life is a life that

147
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:00,600
somehow we allow ourselves the possibility to feel the difficult emotions we have

148
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:08,480
meditation life is a possib time when we we give ourselves a possibility of experiencing the positive

149
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:16,680
emotions that we capable of having some people those are hard to experience both of them in their heart

150
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:24,040
there's something in there that wants to be born that's the nature of our inner life there is something seeds that want

151
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:30,680
to be born and when we in this state of health when really learn to settle and not be

152
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,720
in conflict with things including not be in conflict with the difficult

153
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,959
emotions and create the space to allow something in the darkness

154
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,839
to come forth we don't

155
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:55,959
know what is being conceived in the darkness if we think we have to know

156
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:01,199
everything we're maybe sure changing ourselves elves part of the subtleness

157
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:09,199
of meditation is to allow ourselves not to know to really feel ourselves deeply and

158
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,480
not know because you can't know what's happening in the darkness

159
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,558
within and even if it's like The Dark Night of the Soul kind of time things seem really

160
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:29,039
challenging something wants to be born what is it that wants to be born if you don't make the if you don't

161
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:35,160
make space for that possibility it might get might never be

162
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:43,720
born so to see meditation as a time to really trust being here present there's

163
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,919
a possibility of Inner Health that comes from just letting go and settling and

164
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:55,880
getting focused arriving and being here in the present moment in a full intimate kind

165
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:02,120
of kind of you know a committed

166
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,840
way it allows for whole other possibilities that cannot happen if we

167
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:15,720
stay distracted and so little bit you know to

168
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,360
challenge you it's when you're

169
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,720
distracted that you have withdrawn that you've retreated because You' you think

170
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,320
you've lost the battle Maybe

171
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:41,440
it's coming back and sitting here returning here that our life can come to a kind of

172
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,480
fulfillment that can't come when we're distracted caught up

173
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:55,000
intense so we're at this kind of Junction of the year that uh it's gotten become darker

174
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,720
and darker until Thursday when it was the darkest day of the year for the

175
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,799
Northern Hemisphere and

176
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:12,720
um and who knows what that has been for you maybe it's like the rhythm of

177
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:20,880
sleeping most people sleep at night and then they awake during the day who knows what was going settling and quieting

178
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,039
down and who knows what was what was happening as the days got darker and

179
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:32,679
darker for you maybe it was in very important time to slow down important time to do less less to be outdoors and

180
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:39,840
do a lot of things and now we turn towards the

181
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:48,520
light and now is a time to be particularly receptive what wants to be born out of

182
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:56,400
that so with the solstice on Thursday and in a week or so there's the new

183
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,640
year I'd like to propose that we have this wonderful limal

184
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,720
time to be careful with ourselves this next during this

185
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,320
period because at new years's there's a custom of making a

186
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,760
resolution for their year so but most

187
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:26,919
people I think are not really making the resolutions very well it's wishful

188
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:35,159
thinking what I propose for you is that you use this next week to ask yourself

189
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:42,720
what is it that wants to be born in you what is it that wants to sprout what is it that wants to come out

190
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,840
into life if you sit quietly if you go for walks quietly if you if you try not

191
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:55,600
to be if you avoid being too busy during the season and spend some time being kind of connected to yourself feeling

192
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,720
yourself sensing maybe meditate a little extra and maybe in medit coming on of

193
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,720
meditation maybe you can ask your question what is it that wants to be born in me what is it that this time of

194
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:15,400
the year as the as the light as light gets longer daylight gets longer and longer and symbolizes this way in which

195
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,440
something gets born into the light and grows in the light what is it that wants

196
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,200
to be born in you if you get no answer it's fantastic

197
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,279
that you spend time with that sensitivity to feel for it or sense it so don't worry don't feel

198
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:40,600
bad you don't know what's going on you don't know what's being gestating in there so don't worry about that but if

199
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,640
you come with something that what you feel oh that's what wants to be born that's when you

200
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:53,159
make the resolution resolve for that resolve to feed that and let that grow and and

201
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:59,559
develop in you care for what what wants to sprout

202
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:06,320
and um maybe it's something directly related to meditation directly related to a life of

203
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,480
mindfulness and Compassion maybe it's something directly related to a life of

204
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:19,240
service caring for the people around you because that's what wants to be born

205
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:26,240
or maybe it's uh so many possibilities maybe it's a life of

206
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:33,080
honesty maybe it's a life life that's not being driven by fear or driven

207
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,840
by desires or anger Hill

208
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,320
will maybe it's a life that for the

209
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,880
next 10 11 months does the inner

210
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,770
work that would prepare all all of us for the

211
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:08,080
[Laughter]

212
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:15,480
elections don't let you be don't don't let yourself be surprised prepare for the best best that

213
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,960
you have the world no matter what happens the world needs the best we have to offer

214
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,279
always let that be grow and develop in the light so what is it that wants to be

215
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:32,559
born so

216
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:39,440
th so those are my thoughts and uh now I welcome you if

217
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,880
anyone you have any comments or questions or so in the back Martha in

218
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,000
the

219
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,880
corner hi I just wanted to point out that the uh winter newsletter uh there's a copy when you go out the door has an

220
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,960
article an excellent article by Kim Allen uh in fact on resolutions since it

221
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,600
is the beginning of the year you might find it interesting nice the newsletter has an

222
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,559
article and makes making

223
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
resolves

224
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:42,399
uh how do you think about setbacks in life so often we visualize goals or we set resolutions and you know maybe it's

225
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:50,840
health related and then you fall ill or you know uh you want to run and then you get injured um how are you using your

226
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:59,760
practice to I guess respond to these moments uh well I think this Pro

227
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,520
so didn't help okay so

228
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:14,440
um um I mean one of the two two ways that I want to mention three many so many ways

229
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,120
but one way is that um the healing from these kinds of things works better if there's no

230
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:28,000
tension if there's profound rest and not just the rest of getting enough sleep but even deeper deeper rest and um so

231
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,279
when I've been sick I just I will rest really I'll go to bed and not just lay

232
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:39,600
there sometimes I lay there my eyes closed and kind of meditate and relax and just try to get as deep rest as I

233
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,159
can um and uh and support Aid that rest because then things seem to heal

234
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:52,440
better and um and so and then to let go of tension that we

235
00:25:52,440 --> 00:26:00,640
have to let go of the tensions of it being different as often protests in the mind and anger at how we are I know

236
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,640
people who have had injuries that seemed like horrific injuries really changed their life the rest of their life they

237
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:14,000
were in you know maybe infid or something and um I I don't want to belittle the challenges of that and how

238
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,080
difficult it is but there are some people who after many years will say it was the best thing that happened to them

239
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:26,360
because they had to really the more they were challenged the more they were upset the more that they had to give up uh

240
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:32,960
when you're practicing the more realize that represents something very deep inside deep attachment deep holding on

241
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:40,080
deep expectations deep sense of identity that we have and so this practice allows us to really go in there and question

242
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:46,399
where am I still holding on what you know because why am I so disappointed or

243
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:51,600
discouraged and go in there and find what that is and let go of it and then

244
00:26:51,600 --> 00:27:01,880
uh the whatever the injury has been which maybe was a permanent injury uh is not seen as a as a as a as a problem but

245
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:07,399
more as an asset because it gave a certain kind of inner Freedom that wouldn't have happened

246
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:13,039
otherwise and um so that's some of the ways meditation

247
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:19,200
can help that was that satisfying enough than

248
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,919
yeah may I ask uh why are you asking oh

249
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:30,960
um Mike um I I ask cuz I think of you know setbacks whether they're injuries

250
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,399
or you know failures in your life as uh you know moments that can shake your

251
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:42,919
your sense of self and uh you know stray you from your progress or your goals or

252
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:51,039
you know whatever things in life are that get you out of bed every day and I think in each religious practice it's

253
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,480
important to kind of identify how your faith structure you know helps you

254
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,519
respond to those whether it's you know familial death or you know something like that that just really is

255
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:06,600
something that's difficult so great thank you that's very nice so maybe if

256
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,000
we understand how we can use these things not as a setback but as some

257
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,559
allow something beneficial to happen then maybe it's a set

258
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:24,440
forward hi Gail um again I had a um question as you were asking you know

259
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:31,120
what is waiting to be born um you know meditation at least um has

260
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,440
helped me understand a bit more of my own suffering but I feel it has also

261
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:45,399
particularly this time of the year also made me a little more attuned uh to the suffering of others in your family um

262
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:53,720
and and other places but there is sort of this mix of um helplessness that you feel when

263
00:28:53,720 --> 00:29:00,960
people aren't quite being able to help themselves but you you ALS also really only can go so far how do you you know

264
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:09,559
how do you deal with that sense of wanting to be of service but not quite knowing exactly um what may be able to

265
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:16,600
help particularly when these are situations of uh of psychological and mental he well the the simple answer

266
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:25,000
that hopefully respects the complexity and the fullness of your life and all that is that there's probably more than

267
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,440
just wanting to help them the wanting has extra baggage and so if you look at your

268
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:38,360
desire to to help someone or support someone or companion someone in their difficulties what is that extra that

269
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,760
you're bringing and that's one of the things if

270
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:50,159
you ask that question and then really get quiet and really look and feel what are all the motivations that are behind

271
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:57,279
you and the needs and the desires we're and the way to one of the ways to to to um to find answers to these questions

272
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:02,559
question s that I think can be very helpful and practical is to uh feel your

273
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:10,039
way literally physically to where the tension and the stresses around this issue and that

274
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:15,519
sometimes can reveal uh uh once you find the stress levels you can kind of

275
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:21,640
sometimes then start feeling the emotions behind it and you realize it's not just compassion but there's also

276
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:29,480
some kind of fear and once you recognize the fear then oh there's more here than just wanting to be

277
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,840
compassionate thanks

278
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,039
Gil hi Gale you the example you gave of when you were still sick but you thought

279
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:57,720
that it would be time for you to be healed um is that does that have happen

280
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,039
because we um we're not in touch with ourselves or

281
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:08,639
is it is it because it doesn't match our goals anymore to be

282
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:18,000
sick um and how can how can we help that how can we see that more

283
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,639
clearly um I think it and it helps to look at what the beliefs you have around

284
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:31,799
it and and also a little bit maybe it helps to understand your personality your disposition towards things and um

285
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:37,600
number of things that I affects me so I don't know what goes for you one is um I

286
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,880
I really enjoy doing things

287
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,799
just it's just you know I'm a doer kind of person so I I enjoy it and so I'm

288
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:54,039
just ready to do something okay I'm ready but you're sick

289
00:31:54,039 --> 00:32:00,679
no yes no can't be true so that's part of it uh sometimes it has

290
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:05,760
to do with the sense of responsibility responsibility is prob probably my achilles

291
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,600
heal and so I have to do something I have to respond to that email no you're sick no

292
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:18,360
but something like that and what can help what can help seeing

293
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,919
that that that really helps the most is to see the tricks of the Mind how it

294
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,039
works so you don't uh uh otherwise if you don't see what the mind is doing in

295
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:36,679
terms of the tricks the beliefs the attitudes the fears then uh uh we we then what we're

296
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:43,240
trying to do is trying to override it and that is often creates even more

297
00:32:53,399 --> 00:33:01,159
tension hi um thank you for your talk um so I I have a kind of a a deep health

298
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:07,120
condition or or Challenge and then I have my meditation and in my mind they've

299
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:14,399
actually never met it it's like never occurred to me at all well how could your meditation

300
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:20,000
practice address or help so which begs the question then um is there a

301
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,799
particular way that when I meditate do I think of it as addressing the Health Challenge or do I just kind of uh keep

302
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:33,159
going and not is there some specific thing that I do to make them meet this is a this is a

303
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:39,799
great question Beverly we appreciate it a lot and um so you know I don't feel

304
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:46,760
like I know you well enough to answer you specifically so if this misses you or don't take it too

305
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:54,360
personally um so it's possible that

306
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:03,880
um you have you have to distinguish between two challenges there's the Health Challenge

307
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,000
which is the literal things you have to actually do do the research talk to the

308
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,800
doctors do the exercises physical whatever it might be the things you should

309
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,118
do and but in in the Dharma those wouldn't be called

310
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:27,480
challenges those are just things to do in the Dharma we call challenges psychological challenges around them the

311
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:34,599
frustration the anger the many yeah so so the the how to bring

312
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,800
mindfulness to that is to recognize what those psychological challenges are maybe

313
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:46,760
get a write them down just really make a list of all that just kind of get a sense of the Ecology of the

314
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:52,000
psychological things going on when you call it you're challenged the anger the

315
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,480
frustration the impatience the the hopelessness they all just make make the

316
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:05,320
list and then uh choose one and spend some time

317
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:13,040
uh uh under looking looking looking at the Ecology of that particular challenge

318
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:20,640
what are the beliefs what are the emotions what are the Body Sensations body stresses tensions that come along

319
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,200
what are the emotions what are the Mind States what are the stories kind of

320
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:33,720
begin kind of unraveling all the pieces of that ecological system around that one thing

321
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:39,680
like impatience and then and then the more you could unravel and see the different

322
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,160
pieces of the ecosystem it might be easier for you to

323
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:51,960
then sit in the middle of it and breathe and this is where the meditation comes into play in meditation stop

324
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:58,400
thinking about all this that's what you do other times meditation now you can better identify y it and sit in the

325
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,760
middle of the complex and just breathe with it and see what

326
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,000
happens does that that make some sense uh yes thank

327
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:32,560
you hello hi Gil um I have a question about

328
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:39,280
um so sometimes um I need to do something like

329
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:46,359
I it's let's say this is I work I I must do something um but I'm not sure what is

330
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:52,520
the right thing to do and by the right thing to do is

331
00:36:52,520 --> 00:37:01,079
usually um like in the moral sense of the word um is what is what Moral Moral Moral

332
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:07,560
what's the moral thing to do with work oh this is a good this I love it when people have this question uh I don't

333
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:13,079
love the challenge of knowing how to answer the question so um and some sometimes it's

334
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:20,640
really hard I I think left and right and back and forth and I'm not sure what's the right thing to do how can this

335
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,280
practice uh help in that sense well one of the things is when we if we can

336
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:33,079
return into some deep sense of uh feeling connected deeply to ourselves and feel in harmony with ourselves so

337
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:40,680
that we're not operating on fear or or on anger or confusion or delusions a lot

338
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:46,680
of kind of spinning stories we get below the story level then in in a in a moral

339
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:53,200
sense we can be more in touch with the the ethical deep deep ethical Sensi

340
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,280
sensitivity and Sensibility that we're capable of and then you might be easier

341
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:04,800
to understand what to do may be easy to understand what you have to do even though it's not

342
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:11,800
popular or understand what you have to do even though it might mean losing your job or you know you know giving up your

343
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:19,440
job um but if we are too anxious about this uh and even if we know that this a

344
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,040
moral issue but we're so anxious about trying to figure it out they were so we're spinning out in storying spinning

345
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,319
around the mind uh we might not be in the best state of mind to really address

346
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:36,440
it so one of the things our practice can do is to have this return to some deeper

347
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,960
sensibility who we are that's one the other thing is that this practice

348
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,440
mindfulness a lot to do with understanding what our relationship is to any challenge we

349
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:54,119
have and so there might be get there also there might be fear in relationship to it or desire in relationship to it or

350
00:38:54,119 --> 00:39:01,520
a lot of selfing in relationship to it what do people think think of me for example and so to clarify that how we're

351
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,599
relating to the challenge uh might simplify our ability to understand what the real issues are that have to be

352
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:13,839
solved that's something else another thing that practice can do is that uh it

353
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:19,240
can mindfulness of speaking and mindfulness of listening can uh if we if

354
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:25,440
we practice it can help us slowly learn maybe uh how to have honest

355
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,880
communication I figure out how to speak honestly without uh challenging other

356
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:39,359
people but letting other people know that you're challenged you know I have this ethical issue around this and can

357
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:46,200
we talk about it and and I I feel like I'm left alone to make this ethical decision but it's going to affect the

358
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:53,520
company we're in is there some place I can go where we can kind of brainstorm or go back and forth and find out and I

359
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:00,440
can get some clarity around this and and I don't know if where you work there's any possibility of that or if a colleague you can go for

360
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:07,640
a lunch walk during a lunch break and have this kind of conversation so this idea of using the practice in

361
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:12,800
conversation so that we can have clear more honest conversations about the very

362
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,920
thing I like to believe that mindfulness that honesty is mindfulness out

363
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:26,599
loud so that we're learning how to not just keep it to ourselves but learning to process it uh in relationship to

364
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:32,200
other people as well those are some ideas than so last

365
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:37,240
one was next to you oh it was saying that was okay

366
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:42,880
great okay so maybe uh uh given this

367
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:49,920
very special time of the year turning into the light and we're all kind of doing that together here in person if uh

368
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,720
you would like to turn to a few people next to you and say hello and and um see

369
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:02,040
what they want to do with this growing light as we get bored into it and uh

370
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:07,119
introduce yourself and but look around so that you kind of you say hello to two

371
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:14,240
at least two other people so no one's left alone kind of
