1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:07,960
so greetings welcome good moment to you

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:14,879
all it's morning and uh on the west coast and as

3
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:22,000
uh as I was waking up this morning I saw out the window um the waning the waning

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,880
moon was rising and Venus was leading this bright this bright light in

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,160
front of the Moon and I couldn't help but think of the the closing metaphor from our our time together

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,520
yesterday the four Brahma viharas is like the Sun at different phases of the day and the

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,680
equinity is like the cool light of the

8
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:52,600
Moon that was touching touching to wake up to this morning I hope you're all

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,640
well uh so the theme of compassion we will continue and today we will get

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,879
into um what I I think is a useful topic compassion and not

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,720
self we can hold that in the background for some time while we settle

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,040
and meditate together in this

13
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,360
meditation uh what I will invite us to do is first

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,400
to um include some meta some loving kindness

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,880
or benevolence into our settling process so as as the body and the mind

16
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,640
are actually starting to settle including including the attitude

17
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:49,479
of benevolence in whatever way feels right for you and then after some time of settling

18
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:57,439
with meta in this way um we we will call to mind a

19
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,680
specific being to whom we would like to offer Compassion maybe not someone who's

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,080
having the greatest difficulty but someone someone who

21
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,519
um you this morning when you check in with yourself it feels right for you uh

22
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:21,599
to wish them well that may they be free from suffering and then the third piece of

23
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,840
the meditation this morning will let go of the image of another

24
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:34,879
person and simply let the the attitude the feeling the wish uh of compassion

25
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:41,879
radiate in all directions so just a bit of explanation before we

26
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:47,120
get started so let's find our way into the

27
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,799
meditation

28
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
posture

29
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,080
and right from the start as we're settling in with the body and the

30
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,879
breathing inviting this attitude of

31
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:45,040
Goodwill if it's helpful directing it to yourself maybe with a

32
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,840
reflection may I be

33
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
happy

34
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:13,799
and letting ourselves be nourished by any goodness that comes from that

35
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
wish

36
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,600
scuttling bringing the posture into

37
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,919
balance letting the breathing come into its own

38
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,800
balance and wishing

39
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,880
well may I be

40
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
happy

41
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,000
every breath like a wish for

42
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,720
well-being breathing

43
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
kindness

44
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,640
now a gentle shift and

45
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:53,000
focus calling to mind someone you would like to offer compassion

46
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,279
to an offering

47
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,160
that's within your capacities for this

48
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,640
morning to whom you would like to offer the

49
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,000
wish may you be free from

50
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,800
suffering may you be free from

51
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,519
harm practicing making that intention making that

52
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,079
wish offering it and then registering what

53
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:09,920
happens in this body and mind and then

54
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
again

55
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,519
may you be free from suffering and

56
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
harm

57
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:37,759
may we be free from suffering and

58
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,240
harm practicing this

59
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,759
wish staying mindful

60
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:01,880
throughout so that we can offer peacefully and clearly

61
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
knowing

62
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,679
may we be free from

63
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
suffering

64
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:38,879
and now letting

65
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,640
go of this specific person or

66
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:58,840
being sensing the attitude the felt sense the

67
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,640
intention the wish of

68
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,320
compassion rather than directing it to a specific

69
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,320
being opening ourselves to let compassion

70
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,880
radiate in all

71
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
directions

72
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,320
shining like the gentle light of

73
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Sunset

74
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,320
shining the gentle light of

75
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,320
compassion on all beings in all

76
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,158
directions to the

77
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:29,799
front the right

78
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:43,960
behind to the left

79
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,640
above and be

80
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
love

81
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,679
and in the last minute of this

82
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,120
sitting breathing ease into the

83
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,120
body breathing relaxation into the heart and

84
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,880
mind letting this being here be nourished by

85
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,200
our

86
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
practice

87
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:37,200
may all beings everywhere no

88
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,960
ease and have the causes of true

89
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
happiness

90
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:10,279
[Music] so welcome

91
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,480
again thank you for practicing

92
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:22,279
together my my mind feels uh quite still and

93
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:28,519
wanting to appre wanting to stay in the meditation of compassion

94
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:33,440
but now is the time to reflect on the Dharma

95
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:41,399
together Suzuki roshi the founder of San Francisco Zen Center um is quoted as saying that when

96
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:50,080
the mind is compassionate it is boundless in poly the word is

97
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,080
[Music] aam uh boundless without

98
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,960
boundary understand is without

99
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,679
measure so the far enemy uh in the visim Maga the far enemy of compassion is

100
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:14,159
cruelty it's it's direct opposite compassion is the

101
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:20,279
wish that beings be free from suffering cruelty is the wish that another being

102
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:26,279
be harmed and uh chances are rather high

103
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:32,200
that if one were to look clearly into a heart and a mind when it's in a state of

104
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:38,480
Cruelty you might may find what we colloquially call um some

105
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:45,919
measure of othering some uh self-concern some dominance of the

106
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:52,360
concept of self and in contrast in a in a mind in a

107
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:59,200
state of compassion in one that wishes that no heart harm come to any

108
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,919
being there's this sense of openness and connection and

109
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,480
care and even

110
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:17,159
love so maybe a more subtle and perplexing topic is the meeting of

111
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:25,519
compassion and not self we practice compassion and harmony with not self this is a a question I

112
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:32,600
sometimes feel when uh when practitioners learn about the teaching of not self they start to think oh W can

113
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,559
I can I practice both of these at the same time can I be can I be nobody and

114
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:44,720
love all beings wait but if there if I'm loving all beings am I making beings it

115
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:52,000
gets it gets confusing quickly so to start to clarify this we'll we'll take a short Excursion into

116
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,039
some not self teachings and then I would like to share just two examples of what

117
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:03,760
for this morning I'm going to call empty love that's love that's empty of

118
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,559
self-concern compassion that's empty of concepts of self so let's move first into

119
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:15,840
this teaching on not self it's important to clarify because

120
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,159
there's this really common misconception about not self and I

121
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:27,519
appreciate again venerable analo here um he offered this this teaching that I'm

122
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,880
going to summarize for you uh that the the teaching on not

123
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,760
self very um very easily edges over into being

124
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,080
misunderstood as nothingness but there's uh nothing here

125
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:52,360
there's no one no one here nothing here and this is a misapprehension so instead he offers not

126
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:58,919
self to be understood this way that uh in this body body and mind no there's no

127
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:04,679
permanent entity that we can find if we look at our body if we look at our mind we look at our heart there's nothing

128
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:11,000
permanent we can put our finger on and there's no one in complete

129
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,440
control uh one small and sobering example is that uh however much I might

130
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,000
wish it to be otherwise this body of mine will age and soon enough it will

131
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:30,480
pass away there's no permanent here and nothing in complete control I can't stop

132
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,720
the aging from coming so is there no me the question he

133
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:43,560
poses um so while there's not a permanent entity not something that's in complete

134
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:49,599
control what continues is a process of causes and

135
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:58,040
conditions and this process isn't nothing um in the process there is a

136
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:05,280
continuity and actually this means that I have some responsibility so good example let's say

137
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,920
that a few minutes ago I said something harmful I said something that hurts someone the me of right now is

138
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:18,400
responsible for those words I can't simply say uh no self here wasn't me

139
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,440
there's no self here there is a continuity and I'm

140
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:31,240
responsible so venerable an alio Likens this continuing flow of causes and

141
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:38,599
conditions to a river flowing changing no Essence but a

142
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:45,599
continuity and our our meta and compassion practice are just like that too there's no Essence to them uh but we

143
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,280
feed this uh River of wholesome intention and wishing for the the

144
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:58,560
well-being of others to really drive this point home

145
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,520
about not self uh a second example he offers that

146
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:12,359
uh um we know we know in our uh contemporary understanding that in what

147
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:17,960
we perceive as matter solid matter is actually largely empty space so I just

148
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,280
knocked on my desk because of Zoom you can't hear that mostly empty space this

149
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,040
desk but it doesn't mean that I can walk through it it's still functional so feels

150
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:36,319
hard the second piece is that I I could in theory take this desk and chop it up

151
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:42,599
into teeny bits and turn it into dust and I would never find the the core the

152
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:48,319
essence the desk of this this desk

153
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:54,560
functional and just a matter of causes and conditions and this is precisely the

154
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,880
teaching of not self it's both both emptiness nothing

155
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,520
essential and there's a continuity of conditions emptiness and

156
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:12,440
conditionality this is the teaching of not self two sides of the same

157
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,520
coin so this understanding is um presented in the context of early

158
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,920
Buddhism and of course the dharm has been a long and complex conversation so

159
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,200
understandings have changed over time

160
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,240
so I I will say this morning that our compassion doesn't

161
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,280
require a um an attachment to a self our

162
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:48,040
compassion actually doesn't require selfing activity but interestingly and beautifully our compassion heals selves

163
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:54,119
our compassion uh nourishes selves and nourishes

164
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:01,160
beings so I think this this understanding um shines a very different

165
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:07,000
light on not self and compassion

166
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,400
um it seems very clear in looking at the teachings that the Buddha the Buddha's

167
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,640
the Buddha asks of us to work at the practice of seeing clearly but the

168
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,000
Buddha never asks us to be a

169
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,960
nothing so what might empty compassion look like compassion that's free freed

170
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,040
of self- attachment uh I love offering the

171
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,760
example of the Buddha himself in that the Buddha was confident he was strong

172
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:49,319
he was clear in speech the Buddha was meticulous in his actions and he worked diligently for the

173
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:55,520
benefit of all beings the Buddha was certainly not a nothing and didn't see himself as a

174
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:01,319
nothing even though he saw not self to its

175
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:08,040
depths and compassionate compassionate the Buddha was compassionate after his Awakening he

176
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:15,359
said to have taught or responded to teaching requests out of compassion and then he interestingly he gives two exam

177
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:21,200
two reasons why um he continued to go on Retreat

178
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:30,560
after his Awakening one was for a pleasant abiding here and now and the second was out of compassion for future

179
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:40,040
Generations I love this I'm inspired by this notion that we can conduct our lives in a way that's a a gift to Future

180
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,760
Generations even distant

181
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:53,200
ones so I I see in this I see in the the model of the Buddha someone who was

182
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,520
compassionate someone who was confident someone who was really effective and totally

183
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:05,440
free totally free of entanglement with self-reference uh he offered a sort of

184
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,440
care that wasn't overshadowed by I and me and mine and the light of his

185
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:18,720
compassion wasn't darkened by clinging and demand and

186
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,880
expectations rather his sort of empty

187
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:31,319
brilliant love sort of free compassion he offered radiant and even

188
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:36,839
joyful and what a blessing it is to be this way in the

189
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,920
world and then one more example of when I think of empty

190
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:49,200
compassion I think of Suzuki roshi there's a a story from a a short

191
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,560
collection uh collection of stories about Suzuki roshi called remembering the

192
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:00,160
dragon and its anecdote about Suzuki roshi by his students and I want to I

193
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,040
want to share one with you it makes reference to um a couple of things that should be explained first one is it

194
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:13,280
makes reference to a sort of something called a show sound which is a formal Q&A public ceremony usually at the end

195
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,680
of a retreat in a Zen context and the other other thing that

196
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:24,000
should be explained is um it talks about serving meals in the Zeno serving meals

197
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,760
in the meditation Hall and this is a reference to the monastic style of formal eating uh where

198
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,560
you Ser you you serve food and eat food in a way that um allows you to stay in

199
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,720
meditation continue in your meditation so you'll hear those two

200
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:49,000
references and this story uh comes from Ed Brown and you'll see in in this this

201
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,599
little anecdote uh or I see I see in it in Suzuki Roshi's way a sensitivity to

202
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:04,040
other beings and such skill and Care along with a Clarity of vision and

203
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:10,240
a a confident compassion it's the bringing together of just these two

204
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,599
things so here's Ed Brown when I was at tasahara in the

205
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,760
1960s I was having a lot of trouble with anger actually I was not having much

206
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,400
trouble with it other people at tasahara were having trouble with my anger I thought it was good to be

207
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:33,640
sincere and if you felt angry then be angry don't cover it or repress it then one time I was talking with

208
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:40,760
Suzuki roshi in his cabin he said well Ed you can get angry if you

209
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:47,559
want then after an impeccably timed pause he politely added but

210
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:53,880
don't I felt permission to be who I was while being instructed to reign in my

211
00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:00,119
anger Suzuki R Ro she was for the most part quite polite once at tasahara a

212
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:08,119
student asks him why haven't you enlightened me yet Suzuki roshi answered politely I'm

213
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:14,880
making my best effort and Ed Brown continues I remember

214
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,720
that once during a showan a public formal Q&A ceremony a student asked what

215
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,839
do you feel when I serve you food in the zendo and Suzuki roshi answered I feel

216
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:33,040
like you're offering me your entire being your most perfect

217
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,599
love your entire being your most perfect

218
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:46,760
love so my hope is that we carry this question with us today how can I

219
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:52,760
practice compassion in a way that's free of the entanglements of self attachment

220
00:43:52,760 --> 00:44:00,079
and may it be so and may this River of causes and conditions spread care and compassion

221
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:05,800
for all beings without exception and tomorrow we will turn to

222
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:14,318
some teachings about compassion and Awakening be well thank you so

223
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,880
much
