1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:07,440
hi folks welcome uh yeah some of you might be started the

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,759
stream uh it got started on a private feed I don't know if here somewhere

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,680
in some region of the interwebs but uh we're here chatting saying hello

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,920
um and uh yeah it's a good good night to be

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:34,039
together so um let's let's settle in and uh and practice together

6
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:30,520
so taking some uh Fuller breaths

7
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:38,240
kind of breaths that uh reach everywhere in your

8
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:59,600
body the kind of breaths that uh soften your belly

9
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,640
kind of breaths that uh signal to the cells of your

10
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:34,920
body that it's actually okay to

11
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,800
relax e

12
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,200
sit down into your bones

13
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,519
The Head and the Heart can be more like air more like space but the

14
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:15,959
bones are Earth it's a heaviness to them a

15
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:28,599
groundedness so as this instruction goes sit in your

16
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,680
bones e

17
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,280
gentle uh sense of the downward pull of

18
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:54,120
gravity the Earth offering itself unwaveringly

19
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,440
and there's a heaviness to the body but it's not a

20
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:31,160
dullness it's a heavy aliveness

21
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,880
grounded steady

22
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,400
as the attention maybe dress

23
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:40,479
upwards towards the head towards the Gaze the kind of headquarters apparent

24
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,639
headquarters of uh visual

25
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,639
thinking just keep pouring the

26
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:03,519
attention down into the body into your [Music]

27
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,039
bones as if the awareness emanated

28
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:25,479
from your

29
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
belly

30
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440

31
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360

32
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,360
e e

33
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,959
there's a a growing U stability of our body

34
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,760
kind of

35
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,000
rootedness tianan uses the image of a

36
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,120
mountain body likee

37
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
Mountain e

38
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,830
[Music]

39
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,279
relaxation

40
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,880
Tranquility doesn't mean we have to do something means we're

41
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:24,160
invited to stop doing most everything

42
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:05,800
whatever strange or effort doing this you can

43
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,839
relax just relax

44
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:25,040
that and trust that

45
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:35,160
um the awareness that doesn't depend on you the small self

46
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,920
you that's uh going to be enough that's beautiful

47
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,279
enough to stay awake

48
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,160
grounded sitting in your

49
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:05,040
bones radical permission for life to

50
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:08,079
arise

51
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
cease

e e

59
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,000
because uh the awareness doesn't need

60
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:45,280
you you that Whirlpool of

61
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,919
contraction that we call

62
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,158
me can

63
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
relax

64
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720

65
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640

e e

73
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,600
although this uh stability is a associated with restfulness

74
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,360
Tranquility

75
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,679
peace we cannot forget our debt to love

76
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:14,000
sometimes the body tranquilized

77
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:26,440
restful it's like one drop of love just flavors the whole Space

78
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:46,000
and the blooming collapsing blossoming of Body Sensations becomes a

79
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,880
way of radiating meta loving

80
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
kindness e

81
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:38,880
sometimes we practice met uh not because we're inclined to but

82
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,640
because we know we

83
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
must

84
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
e e

85
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
e e

86
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,039
okay good to is sit with

87
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:45,000
you when uh when I was young uh even as a young kid but especially as an

88
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,600
adolescent it's not unique to me but uh as an adolescent I remember

89
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,840
feeling um so kind of let down by institutions by

90
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:07,720
um by school and the religion I was born into and the kind of cultural models

91
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:15,240
proferred about what is Meaningful what what what's a a reasonable life and

92
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:21,600
um and in that uh disappointment there was some some discernment some

93
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,600
discernment for sure but mostly I was angry you know and

94
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:35,279
it was kind of just aversion spraying everywhere sort of fire hose style you

95
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:42,000
know um and yet like lurking in that

96
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,120
anger was a kind of earnest hopefulness

97
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:54,559
you know maybe even amidst the cynicism you know it like the cynicism

98
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:03,000
disguised some kind of utopian fantasies you know just wanting institutions to be

99
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:10,600
more fair more honest more attuned to What happiness actually

100
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:18,799
is and again and again my heart would

101
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:26,399
break and it was almost like the the first Noble Truth

102
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:33,440
constellating at the level of the group or the institution we know the duk uh

103
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:40,080
suffering at the level of the individual but but it also constellates at the level of the

104
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,320
group and it's its own unique species of

105
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:52,320
duka and so against that background years later when I heard the

106
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,679
phrase disenchanted with samsara the disenchant

107
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:06,360
some Sor I I was very interested you

108
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:14,240
know and it it seemed oh you know and samsara this kind of Realm of this human

109
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:23,240
realm of cyclical I I associate it with the kind of Loops of suffering the cycles of

110
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,440
suffering and disenchanted with Sam Sor that seemed almost like the most

111
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:34,039
profound way of expressing my disillusionment and heartbreak it's like

112
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:42,000
okay I give up get me out get me

113
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,159
out and there's one way of reading you know

114
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:55,480
the the Buddha's life the wish not to be reborn

115
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:03,399
you know as something akin to get get me out of here you know and we know that to be

116
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:11,720
rooting for the world that guarantees a tremendous amount of suffering for

117
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:19,600
sure that's not the end of the story so yeah on the one hand

118
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,440
disenchantment is so important because our default position is to be

119
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:34,559
essentially mesmerized by some sorrow to be mesmerized by samsara means that everything is real

120
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:41,799
all all appearances all phenomena lead us to forget the vastness of space and

121
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:49,279
time we become very myopic the appearances all means so

122
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:54,320
much this thing that thing my

123
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:01,080
life and all the the problems are problems of conditions the solution is

124
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:07,599
adjusting conditions and when we're mesmerized by Sam Sora we're often very

125
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:13,560
self-absorbed just a lot of energy to kind of in the clinging and the

126
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:19,720
strategizing in the control Lane and

127
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:25,638
um there's there's a lot of hope you know when we're mesmerized hope that we

128
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:31,320
might kind of achieve a steady state fix the

129
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:39,919
Brokenness and yeah some part of me wanted wanted out wanted protection you

130
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:45,839
know just uh get me get me

131
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:51,679
out you know it's too much it's too much that phrase that that's a kind of Trope

132
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:59,880
across the decades for me it's too much and uh as I emerged from a a you

133
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:07,400
know a 5-day Retreat you know and saw the news and it's like okay same feeling

134
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:13,960
too much caring too much or caring not at

135
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:20,000
all I could feel the kind of pull of nihilism I felt that pull at various

136
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,880
points but the Buddha warned really clearly warned about that

137
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:34,720
you know that nothing means anything a kind of emptiness that acknowledges no

138
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:43,720
form and rage and disappointment the the the Heartbreak of Institutions you know

139
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:49,240
aversion that can masquerade as as disenchantment nihilism can masquerade

140
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:55,599
as disenchantment but what what is it really what is it

141
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:02,040
really disenchantment lies between everything means everything and

142
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:07,359
nothing means anything everything means everything is

143
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,920
a kind of recipe for melodrama nothing means anything is

144
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,640
cynicism and between these two we find our

145
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:26,440
life and but to be in the middle to hang in the balance between

146
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:33,800
everything means everything and nothing means anything The View must be very

147
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:39,560
vast to be neither melodramatic nor nihilistic

148
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,760
about heartbreak that takes Incredible

149
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:52,280
strength there's a a moral philosopher um swick

150
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:59,400
um use the phrase different context but the phrase

151
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:09,119
the point of view of the universe and it struck me like that just

152
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:16,560
intuitively the point of view of the universe that's a pretty nice

153
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,319
encapsulation of the vastness of which I

154
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:27,680
speak and a view of course is more than

155
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,920
than a belief you know it's um it's not it's not a narrow

156
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:42,200
cognitive I think visceral visceral it's a felt

157
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:48,079
sense it's about perception how we actually perceive phenomena The View

158
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:54,000
informs how we perceive everything and it's about our body the

159
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:01,560
body I was pointing to in our sit you know the view is is it it's almost like

160
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,119
the body in a certain shape of

161
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:14,520
openness and the vastness you know the vastness

162
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:21,000
knows change you know knows change

163
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:29,200
knows just How Deeply that's woven into the fabric of being knows dukka knows

164
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:36,040
suffering knows it feels like geologic time the

165
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:42,720
point of view of the universe is like you know it's just kind of

166
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:50,280
like my own grandiosity that just this this moment in time means so much this

167
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,760
life this place this space you know and so the vastness of

168
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:03,079
the view knows like oh almost has this this palpable sense of the vastness of

169
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:11,839
time and space light years millions of light years of

170
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,079
space and this view doesn't discount suffering

171
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:26,440
and doesn't discount Freedom the vastness we could say is

172
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:36,119
simultaneous L uh knowing emptiness and poignancy

173
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,760
emptiness and poignancy

174
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:49,000
empty phenomena rolling on empty phenomena tumbling on who who can be

175
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:58,640
harmed what can be harmed you need solidity for something to be harmed

176
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,318
we've been here before it's always been like

177
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:13,960
this and maybe it's like a kind of very wise Grandma seeing

178
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:21,040
her 5-year-old grandchild the small cut

179
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:28,319
crying except uh it's like the child it's the universe

180
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:37,480
and from that that view it truly does all

181
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:46,680
belong it can never all work out and yet we engage our

182
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,640
love we engage our

183
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,520
love but it's not a confined love

184
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:07,318
and if there's even a cintilla of control in the love the heart will break

185
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:16,480
again and so if we truly understood the characteristics Dua anicha

186
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,800
anata suffering uncertainty not self if we truly

187
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:28,200
understood the characteristics at depth

188
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:34,359
how vast would our mind be how vast would the view

189
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,160
be and um I sometimes talk about equinity is

190
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,400
love in the face of helplessness the end of our

191
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:58,680
power and um in a way the vastness uh

192
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:06,039
is is a kind of acknowledgment of the near completeness of one's

193
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,240
helplessness but it's married to

194
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:22,000
love and the love gets big and

195
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:29,119
peaceful for this we are

196
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:37,400
consideration and uh I appreciate the opportunity to

197
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:44,838
uh uh be with you in this way thank you
