1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,520
so mindfulness of body something i have in mind to share

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:15,679
tonight and so in poly canon text and the buddha often

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:25,199
and talks about the mindfulness of body

4
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,078
he says the mindfulness of the body one cultivated and developed is of a

5
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,079
great fruit and a benefit

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,480
so i thought i'd share a little bit of the teachings of a mindfulness body based on the poly canon text

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,920
specifically and this uh suta and the title of the

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,440
suta is mindfulness of the body and the susuta can be found

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,680
and in machu nikaya 119 for those who you know might be

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,080
interesting looking it up so much money kayla 1 19.

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,600
so mindfulness of body is also often uh emphasized um

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,438
in secular mind mindfulness meditation teachings

13
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,240
and in secular mindfulness teachings and often the teachers would start with

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:38,400
mindfulness of body for example mindfulness of breath or becoming aware of

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,799
and the sensations in the body and through this kind of awareness of what

16
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:52,159
is happening in this lived experience in the body we began to cultivate our capacity

17
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,000
to live in the present moment with more clarity

18
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,240
the mindfulness body however in the poly canon teaching

19
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:13,200
is much more um extended expansive and has a profound

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,920
implications and so uh buddha on one buddha taught

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,760
mindfulness of a body and the whole sequence of the practices that's introduced

22
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,920
in mindfulness of body are meant to lead all the way to full awakening liberation

23
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,519
in addition to many other benefits and that may be a bit available to

24
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,800
oneself and so i want to share a little bit

25
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,280
about this sequence of practices that the susuta talked about

26
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,840
and some of them are not very

27
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,760
not often taught in secular mindfulness teachings

28
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:11,120
however they can be quite profound and so this mindfulness of body teaching

29
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,000
consists of seven different practices and that are ordered in a particular

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,120
sequence i can be thought as a progressive sequence

31
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,519
to cultivate mindfulness in somebody and through which through the sequence

32
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,519
of a practice one can have a great clarity

33
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,319
into the very nature of this body which is according to the three key

34
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:52,400
insights anicha dukkha and that is an impermanence non-satisfactoriness

35
00:03:52,400 --> 00:04:01,840
of this body and that cannot be identified as self anata

36
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,480
so through these forms of insights it becomes possible to have a complete destruction

37
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,560
of defilements and that leads to full awakening

38
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,919
so what are the seven different practices

39
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,160
so i'm going to give you this list of the seven first and so you maybe orient your mind a

40
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,520
little bit to this list of seven and then i'll walk through each of this

41
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,880
and in some form of a sequence and to say a few words about each of them

42
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,320
so this list of the seven uh in poly canon text it starts with

43
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:50,639
mindfulness of breathing and however in the chinese parallel

44
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,320
of the poly canon text mindfulness breathing actually is number

45
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:04,320
three in this sequence um which i'll say a few words and um uh the sequencing

46
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,280
a little bit later but i just started with the list number one mindfulness breathing the

47
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:19,120
second one is awareness of the four postures that is walking standing sitting down

48
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,759
and lying down the third is awareness of the bodily

49
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,960
activity and that is if you're bending down

50
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,880
you know you're bending down if you're eating you know you're eating if you're cooking you know you're

51
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,280
cooking and so whatever you're doing in terms of bodily activities

52
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,680
and you know that this is happening so that's number three awareness of the

53
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,639
bodily activities number four is the contemplation of the

54
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,520
anatomical parts as a different parts of the body

55
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:09,919
contemplation of that this body is made up of different parts component parts

56
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:18,160
number five is contemplation of the four elements earth water fire

57
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:25,840
and air in other suitors it also talks about um the fifth element which is space

58
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,039
but not in this particular suta and number six is the corpse

59
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:37,280
contemplation contemplation of the different stages of decay

60
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,639
of the dead body corpse number seven is the four jhanas which is

61
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,840
the four stages of samadhi

62
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:57,360
and so it's very interesting to look at this sequence to see what is happening with this

63
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,000
sequence and then for me it made a little more

64
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,120
sense that the mindfulness of breathing is number three and the whole sequence starts with um

65
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:18,400
something that is relatively easy to know very simple intuitive and

66
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,800
quite global and so for most of the folks who began to practice engage in

67
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:33,520
a mindfulness of body practice there's the first to feel are relatively easy easily accessible

68
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,840
so for example being aware of our postures and we all know that we

69
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,319
have some sort of posture and we're aware of it and so the practice is to simply know

70
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,879
that oh you know i'm standing right here i'm standing or on

71
00:07:52,879 --> 00:08:02,319
if you're lying down just aware that you're lying down very light weight noticing just know

72
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:09,520
and then uh the awareness of a body activities um it's also something very

73
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,560
um relatable and maybe comparing to the first practice it has a

74
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,840
little more detail and so you are you're now paying attention to different

75
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,560
activities as you uh go about your daily life and so

76
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:36,320
um it's maybe has a little more detail than adjusted the four postures

77
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:45,040
and then after that mindfulness a briefing so now we're settling down to a more

78
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,680
settled state of being where we begin to pay attention to some

79
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,880
details of the activity and as this whole sequence of seven unfolds

80
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:06,959
and you get a sense that there is a growing sense of settledness

81
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:13,760
and the subtlety and collectedness and so the

82
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,320
strength of samadhi and mindfulness began to build up as we

83
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:27,680
practice in this way starting from the first practice mindfulness of

84
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,600
awareness of the posture awareness of the bodily activities

85
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,360
and yet you know the practice doesn't have to go uh in sequence exactly like this you know

86
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,399
for most of us and we may practice in one particular one uh in different situations and then just

87
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,560
practice with that for quite some time so for example becoming aware of

88
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,360
on the bodily postures and bodily activities and was a

89
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:09,279
you know a practice that i engaged in for quite some time and especially at the beginning of my um

90
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,680
meditation practice i didn't have a regular formal

91
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,360
meditation sitting but i was

92
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,320
still interested in cultivating mindfulness and so i incorporated just noticing

93
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:36,000
my activities as i go about on kind of living my life in daily life

94
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,200
and it has an effect because becoming aware of our coarser level um

95
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:50,800
postures and body activities in action it began to cultivate and tone our mind

96
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:58,079
from this muscle and as we actually sit down

97
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:05,040
when we begin to sit down if we had cultivated this mindfulness

98
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,320
in our daily life by noticing various activities as we

99
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,720
we do them on the sitting meditation can be more

100
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:23,440
easily um uh settling so one can settle down but much more quickly

101
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,800
but if you know during the day um you know whatever you're doing you're

102
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,839
very preoccupied with thinking this thinking that and and you

103
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,560
know for example if you're cooking uh instead of noticing that you're cooking and you

104
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,839
know taking this spatula or flipping the pancakes and you're simply thinking

105
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,760
about all kinds of things and then we have last opportunities to really begin to

106
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:01,360
atone our mindfulness muscle and as we sit down and to do our formal meditation

107
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:11,279
our mind can still have this momentum to jump here and there i'm busy engaging in all kinds of

108
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:18,399
mental activities so this first few a couple of mindful body

109
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,839
practices can be a great way to really set the conditions up for us

110
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:32,399
and to go into more formal meditation practice

111
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,800
but they they can also be complementary to formal meditation practice

112
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,120
and some people do formal walking meditation on retreats or daily life and that

113
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:53,839
itself can be a very meditative meditative process as well

114
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,200
and then as this process goes on the next um practice that's being

115
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,880
introduced is mindfulness of in and out breathing

116
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:14,079
in this particular suta mindfulness of a breathing and that's being described here uh

117
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,200
includes the four steps of mindfulness breathing that is

118
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:26,880
noticing in and out breathing as it is and as you breathe in and out

119
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:34,800
begin to come and settle the body and so in our meditation before this

120
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,000
talk we did a little bit of that and kind of as we began to

121
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,360
uh breathe in and out this process itself can begin to settle the body

122
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:54,240
and allow the body to become quieter and calmer

123
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:02,320
and some of you may know that um mindfulness breathing itself and

124
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,959
can be a a whole system a comprehensive process of its own that leads to full

125
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,399
awakening and that process consists of the 16 steps

126
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:21,839
that go through mindfulness breathing that allows the body to come calm down

127
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:28,399
and then allow the mind to settle and then um go through the process to

128
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:36,480
cultivate joy and tranquil tranquility and and also leading to seeing

129
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,600
the insight and the nature of our experiences

130
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:48,800
and so that that itself is a 16 step of a process in this suta

131
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,839
it's the first four steps and that are related to calming and easing the body

132
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,839
that's being brought here

133
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:07,279
and then but it has an effect because as we go through on this mindfulness

134
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,560
breathing process when our bodies become to come

135
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:20,480
down the next few practices that are introduced become

136
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,199
more relevant to become more available to us and so for example the next uh practice

137
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:36,320
that's been introduced in the susuta is the contemplation of the analytical parts

138
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,759
so this is a a contemplation that is

139
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:48,720
not taught often in secular mindfulness some teachers also teach contemplation

140
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:56,720
of analytical parts but it's not very popular and and yet in and the mindfulness of

141
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,320
body teaching and it's a quite a significant

142
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:09,040
practice of its own so what you can and one way to understand this

143
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:16,720
particular teaching is that as we become calmer in relationship to our body we can begin

144
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:24,560
to see this body in a bit more raw form rather than a bigger conceptual

145
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:31,519
framework of what this body is you know whether it's beautiful or ugly kind of all these other conceptual

146
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:39,199
things began to kind of fade out but we can begin to see this body

147
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:45,360
as it is in terms of its componentary and parts

148
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:53,199
and so the classic teaching and is to see this a body in terms of the 32 parts

149
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:59,920
or 31 parts starting from the exterior part of our body

150
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,839
you know body hairs and skin the nails and then go through this

151
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:12,559
process and and begin to contemplating internal of the body also

152
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:21,120
and all the way to on you know our flesh bones fat um and the body

153
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:28,480
liquids even including our your urine and um so you you know you ask

154
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:35,200
why why do we do this contemplation and that's probably not very popular

155
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:43,679
because if we begin to look at this body in this way often our immediate reaction

156
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:50,720
could be you as some form of aversion of repulsiveness

157
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,799
and so maybe that that's kind of why it's not very popular teaching uh in

158
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,799
contemplation of our mindfulness of the body teachings

159
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,919
but the buddha prescribed this specific teaching um as a way to really

160
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,280
point at some strong forces of craving in us

161
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:23,039
in particular craving for essential pressures it's not very hard to see that

162
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,160
you know many people and most of us probably have a strong claiming to our

163
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:38,080
bodies one way or another and i'm aware and that even for

164
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:45,919
kids when they are very young they will begin to have some sense of how they wanted to be

165
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:53,840
seen from the image or perspective what to wear and

166
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:01,039
how long a hair is and as the kids grow older you know in teenage

167
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:08,240
years young adults body images you know can be become so defining for

168
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:15,600
who we are i can certainly relate it to this myself

169
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,840
and as we get older uh we we can get very obsessed with our health

170
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,520
our the aging process

171
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:36,240
and so it's not hard to see that you know there can be a lot of cleaning and grasping

172
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:44,160
in relationship to this body and the buddha has um really seen this

173
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:52,000
um that in you know kind of the human psyche and so he prescribed to this kind

174
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,400
of contemplation to begin to see this as is

175
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,720
not something to be clinged to as you know beautiful

176
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:12,400
or repulsive against as ugly but just as this is what

177
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,600
what is what the body is made up of

178
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,400
and yet you know as we um began to engage in a practice like this the

179
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,880
contemplation of the analytical part there can also be some danger because

180
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:37,120
for those who do have a very negative and repulsive relationship

181
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:44,080
with one's own body and this form of practice can can lead to

182
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,320
um i don't know depression or it maybe even self-harm

183
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:57,200
and so it's a wise to really tune in to what kind of attitude we may have

184
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,360
and maybe even work with the teachers and to engage with this kind of practices so

185
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,799
that one can move with this practice move into this practice

186
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:15,440
with a more balanced mind in the suta and the simile that is being

187
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:24,080
used to describe this particular form of practice is that asia for one is looking into

188
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:32,159
a bag of mixed lentils and mixed rice and knows that you know the red lintel

189
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,919
is red lentil black lentil is a black lentil and and this is the way to look at you know

190
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,440
here the body has all those different parts just like you know the bag of lentils

191
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:51,679
and rice mixed up here and so there's no attitude of indulging

192
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,440
or attitude of pushing away and so it's a very neutral

193
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,840
way of looking at things as is

194
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,159
and so that's contemplation of the analytical parts

195
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:14,240
now moving from there the next practice that's being introduced in this

196
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:21,039
sequence is the contemplation of the four elements

197
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,880
and so what is happening is um in this stage now uh one

198
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:36,559
once um contemplation of reflection or observing of this body

199
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:43,919
is now moving into more of a felt sense of what this body is

200
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,799
now this may not be very obvious if one just began to practice

201
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:57,440
mindfulness body because it's not very uh common for one to relate to this

202
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,720
body at this level which can be not very intuitive

203
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,520
or hard to be accessible at the beginning but if we practiced

204
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:16,080
as and the sequence unfolds we began to see that once mindfulness

205
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,960
maybe began to grow i might one is able to let go of some of the higher level

206
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,240
concepts and ideas but now one is able to drop into

207
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,600
the raw and felt sense of what this body feels like

208
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:40,159
so the elemental natures of this body the firmness of the earthy part of the

209
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,440
body and the air and movements of the

210
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,840
of the body and then the space all around us inside us

211
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,600
and so contemplation of the four elements allow us to begin to cultivate even

212
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:05,840
further what this body is in the elemental level the raw level

213
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:14,320
and so this particular practice based on the contemplation of the four

214
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,720
elements and can also cultivate a strong sense of

215
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:27,279
ease unsettledness and so this allows the next

216
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,840
practice to begin to become accessible so the next practice is

217
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:40,000
a corpse contemplation again this may be something kind of a

218
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,600
provocative in our modern

219
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,200
secular my mindfulness teachings and rarely you would hear people talk

220
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,600
about corpse contemplation um yet the corpse contemplation

221
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:06,080
serve um very um how do i say it

222
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:14,559
very critical step in this cultivation and that is it's moving into a different

223
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:22,158
form of a perceiving the nature of this body

224
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,600
usually when we come to uh the notion of a death

225
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,919
most of us most people will have some sense of a denial even though we

226
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:46,720
all know that the death would happen but one would refuse to see it but through this

227
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,880
a process of cultivating how we see our bodies in this sequence of our

228
00:25:52,880 --> 00:26:00,880
practices when it gets to corpse contemplation a mind may be more centered and began to

229
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,440
be waving to see oh this body is of nature to

230
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:14,880
age of the nature to be sick and of the nature to die

231
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,480
and even when this dead body [Music]

232
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,600
even when the death happens this dead body go through its own decomposition process will

233
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,880
eventually go back to earth go back to nature

234
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:43,880
and since through seeing that this it can lead oneself to an insight into impermanence

235
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:51,840
unsatisfactoriness of this body and the not self nature of this

236
00:26:51,840 --> 00:27:00,158
this body is not something that we can hang on it's not something permanent

237
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:06,559
and so this corpse contemplation began to bring in kind of front and

238
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,760
center this inside way of seeing inside way of seeing

239
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:20,159
the nature of this body anitja dukkha and anata

240
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:27,520
and when we began to be able to see this body in this way there can be

241
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,559
a profound sense of letting go as well

242
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:39,840
and so in this sequence and the seventh practice is that of the four genres

243
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,080
it's a cultivation of the four stages of samadhi

244
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:53,520
and this is impossible because when um when we began to see the nature of

245
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,640
this body there can be a strong sense of letting go letting go of grasping and

246
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:05,679
cleaning and when the clinging and grasping are let go of

247
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:14,840
a deeper sense of well-being can bubble up joy tranquility equanimity can become

248
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:22,799
available and that can become a platform for us to lead into

249
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:32,240
full liberation awakening and so this process um that's described

250
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:41,200
uh prescribed by um this particular suta that includes um you know from a very

251
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:48,520
simple lightweight practice of being aware of our body postures body

252
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:56,120
activities to our breath and to noticing and reflecting

253
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:04,399
contemplating that this body has made component parts and all the way to begin to notice

254
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:12,559
that there is a felt sense of this body which is very uh elemental nature of

255
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:18,399
this body through this then the the

256
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:26,640
samadhi becomes available to us and this can lead to lead to

257
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,480
destruction of defilements so this is really kind of a holistic

258
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:39,840
system and that covers the uh the entire spectrum

259
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,679
spectrum of our practice and this practice has a lot of benefits

260
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:52,000
and the suta itself i have highlighted 10 different benefits you know ranging

261
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,279
from no longer being a victim of a desire and a discontent no longer being a

262
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:06,240
victim of a fear and dread and have a stronger capacity to endure

263
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,640
the vicissitudes of climate and hunger and disagreed and disagreeable

264
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,080
conditions all the way to destruction of

265
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:25,039
the defilements as i mentioned before and it's a very profound teaching

266
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:32,240
and so um i do hope that tonight's practice and

267
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:39,679
and this dharma talk is a bit of an inspiration for us to engage

268
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:46,640
in this practice with a lot of curiosity and

269
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,679
maybe some dedication and so may this mindfulness body practice

270
00:30:53,679 --> 00:31:00,159
bring much benefit to all of us and to all beings thank you for being

271
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,600
here tonight and i wish you all a wonderful evening

272
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:19,600
or a wonderful day wherever you are so thank you
