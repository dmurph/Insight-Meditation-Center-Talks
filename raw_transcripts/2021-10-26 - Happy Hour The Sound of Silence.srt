00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:28,400
actually if you wanted to to see to put zoom for those who are on zoom to

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,440
use gallery view to see each other to get a sense of the sangha here assembled it's quite sweet the sangha from all

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,239
over the world all over the country and the world so it's just heartwarming to sit and

7
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,079
practice with with friends so

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,039
so so for the practice today

9
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,280
um i'd like to invite us

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,359
i'd like to invite us um

11
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:13,040
to practice so in the past few sessions i think maybe

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,159
last week one of the sessions that one theme that i invited us to work

13
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,280
with was listening listening with our hearts listening with our hearts

14
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:31,360
and the sense of opening and some of you shared that that was like open awareness practice but with

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,640
the sense of warmth of the sense of care settling into our bodies

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,200
settling into our awareness the sense of warmth and care

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,280
and and also i remember at the end with the

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,240
reflections some sangha members who have tinnitus for some it became better easier to work

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,680
with the tendons since it was all about listening but not listening with the ears listening with the heart but their

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,200
tinnitus for some it got better and some for some it became more prominent

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,319
so i wanted to lean into that a little more actually and lean into that and

22
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,360
whether you have tinnitus tinnitus also pronounced and those who don't know

23
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,760
what that is that's a it's ringing in the ears that can happen for a period of time or

24
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,879
for a long time and the sense of hearing

25
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:38,480
a sound that is not there and yet and yet what i want to also invite us to

26
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,000
consider is something else that many practitioners or some practitioners

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,800
work with which is called the nada sound the nada sound so the

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:59,519
nada sound i think it's arjun suchita if i remember correctly yes ajahn suchita who is a

29
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,319
well practiced uh well-respected monk in the

30
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,319
uh ajahn chah forest tradition and

31
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,080
for an object of awareness you know we can use the breath the breath in breath

32
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,560
out breath in breath out breath as as a stabilizer as an anchor as a

33
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,519
support or we can use the sensations in the body

34
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,360
we can there's also so many different objects the visude maga

35
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,480
which is this book called the path of purification it's about a thousand page

36
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,680
meditation instruction from um from 500 years after the buddha's death

37
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:59,200
um so it's an ancient two thousand year old roughly i think two thousand roughly

38
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,530
maybe i'm getting their years old mixed up it's a 1500 2 000 year old

39
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:10,159
[Music] manual lists a lot of different

40
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:18,320
ways for our mind to get still for objects for objects to uh of them

41
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,360
various objects to bring our awareness to so

42
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,880
not a sound what is not a sound not a sound is the sound of silence

43
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,919
it's listening to silence it's the sound of silence so listening to the sound of silence and

44
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:42,240
when you listen to the sound of silence actually after a while you can hear it's almost

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,360
like you can hear a buzzing it's like an echo that is easily available to those who have tinnitus

46
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,919
tinnitus and for those who don't have that stimulus that sound readily available if

47
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,600
you really listen to silence you start to hear a sound you start to hear the

48
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,360
sound that's always present and actually that sound can be a very

49
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,560
comforting depending on how we see it how we relate to it it can seem like oh

50
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:20,880
this sound that helps that's pervasive that's everywhere and can support the mind to get very

51
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:28,960
still very open very quiet this this 360 degree soundscape is not a

52
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,400
sound this sound of silence which again recall it's we're saying

53
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,759
calling it the sound of silence but after a while you can hear it so in some ways it's actually it's tinnitus it's

54
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,720
tinnitus but when you really lower the threshold of hearing of listening and you listen very

55
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,160
very intently so

56
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,600
so why may this be helpful why am i bringing

57
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,280
bringing this in both to support those members in the sangha who

58
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,240
do have tinnitus and work with tinnitus and also for those who don't

59
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:20,479
it to open our hearts our minds to this other object of

60
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,720
um of concentration of the mind settling with appreciation

61
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,680
and it can shift one's perspective if one has tinnitus in this way perhaps for

62
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,520
some to open up to it as as a pervasive object

63
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,600
of sound that's present and non-threatening the same way that the sound of silence

64
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,160
is actually always present to share with you that for a period of

65
00:06:52,160 --> 00:07:00,240
my practice i actually worked with sound of silence as my object of concentration

66
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,680
and it was lovely it was just lovely i could just relax it was like surround sound i

67
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,000
could relax into this sound this ambient sound that was

68
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,039
always present was always present and felt calming felt soothing felt as

69
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,440
if i was tuning into this ever-present sound

70
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,880
that's always there that i didn't notice before which again i can only imagine

71
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,520
not having had tinnitus again inviting inviting a shift in perspective that

72
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,919
might be helpful for working with tinnitus for those who have it and again if there is resistance

73
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,280
here it's okay to notice if there is resistance well not a sound is different well

74
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,960
is it maybe not so so inviting if we can inviting some

75
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,560
exploration for all of us with this with not a sound

76
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,919
with the sound of silence hearing this reverberation the sound that is ever

77
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:16,000
present ever-present and can help us relax settle

78
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,560
open our hearts to all the sounds in the universe in all the sounds in our

79
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,720
life present and unpresent that we don't always hear it's all like listening to

80
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,320
the cries of the world and compassion we open our heart to the

81
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,399
cries of the world so listening to not a sound is a symbolism

82
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,399
is a symbolic way to listen to to open up to the cries of

83
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,839
the world the ten thousand joys and ten thousand sorrows of the world

84
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:58,320
to open up to listen with our hearts to the sounds we usually do not hear

85
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,920
to this to make our hearing with our hearts again when i say hearing the

86
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,399
hearing with our of our hearts so attuned

87
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,920
so sensitive that we can hear

88
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,320
the sounds we usually don't hear the cries of the world but both internally

89
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,800
and externally so that's how i would like to relate the nada sound to our

90
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:38,399
practice of meta and compassion okay that is the invitation tonight and again

91
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,680
working with however it works for you you're always welcome to be your inner

92
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,480
dharma coach your own inner dharma coach and changing the invitations so that

93
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,519
they work for you so that they work for you okay

94
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,200
all right i've spoken a lot tonight to set up the frame it's a bit of a

95
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,560
different frame than usual so let us begin let us begin our

96
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,320
practice together so let's land

97
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,399
let's land in our bodies first and foremost become embodied

98
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,120
ah letting go of all the words letting go

99
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:40,079
of everything that has come before and tuning in

100
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,079
tuning inward to this body

101
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:52,560
what does this body need in this moment how can i take care of this body in this

102
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,720
moment do i need to sit up straighter

103
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,200
to give myself more energy to perk up

104
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,200
i need to relax and soften

105
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,879
the muscles

106
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,920
landing landing in the body

107
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:36,399
let us start as always with the breath and the body first to get embodied

108
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,339
feeling our bottom on the cushion [Music]

109
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,680
our feet on the floor contact points

110
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,279
our hands on our lap are touching each other

111
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,040
the weight of our body the whole weight of our body

112
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,079
ah the out breath relaxing

113
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,639
ah letting go of the weight of our forehead

114
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:52,120
our head our eyes our jaw

115
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,839
the chin the neck hands the arms

116
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,360
the torso our bottom [Music]

117
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,240
ah with the next out breath letting go of the weight of the legs

118
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,839
the entire body

119
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:45,120
bringing the awareness internally letting the awareness be in the belly

120
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,160
now receiving the movement of the breath

121
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,399
and the abdomen

122
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,680
if thoughts arise

123
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:45,839
you notice you're resting now in a thought awareness it's no longer with the breath it's okay

124
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:52,639
this is what minds do smilingly smile

125
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,360
at this thought memory plan

126
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,320
thank you thank you but not now please come back later

127
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:13,839
whining inviting awareness to rest to receive the breath of the abdomen

128
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,880
calming soothing

129
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,760
one breath at a time

130
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:15,120
so calming and soothing just to be with the breath opening opening the awareness

131
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:22,560
with ease with receptivity just this in-breath

132
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,759
the entirety of the in-breath and the entirety of the opera

133
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,960
now let yourself receive the breath

134
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,440
with the heart center and the heart center middle of the chest

135
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,280
as if the breath is coming in coming out from the proverbial heart center center

136
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:58,160
of emotions in the chest hello breath hello dear breath

137
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,320
life-giving breath and see if there can be a sense of

138
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,880
appreciation of the sense of awareness of each breath

139
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,240
and now imagine that the breath

140
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,679
is filling your heart

141
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,600
as if your heart is the area that the breath is filling

142
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,440
coming into and exiting is larger

143
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,360
within you and all around you

144
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,280
circular orb

145
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,880
don't try too hard don't push it let it just be kind of oh

146
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,279
easy it's just here

147
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,600
surrounding air surrounding me inside me outside me entering the heart

148
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:37,159
let it be a light imagination not too hard don't push it

149
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,440
one that doesn't bring strain but makes your

150
00:19:51,440 --> 00:20:00,160
heart relax your mind relax soften feel supported

151
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,039
safety all around

152
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,120
breath coming in on its own exiting on its own

153
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,960
it's not much for us to do

154
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,120
and to just hold witness with our hearts

155
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,000
easeful peaceful easy

156
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:34,559
as you land relax more fully into your body into your sit bones

157
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,600
open up your heart not your ears in your head no

158
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,960
open your heart to all the sounds

159
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:59,840
again it's not effortful listening and if you're listening with your ears straining let it go

160
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:09,960
you're landing relaxedly as if loving all the sounds

161
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,679
the soundscape of being human in this moment

162
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:34,480
listening with your heart maybe even if you notice you're listening with your ears put your hand your heart center in the

163
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:41,840
middle of your chest listening with your heart

164
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,279
listening with your body resonating with your whole body

165
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,880
sounds internally externally it's all okay

166
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:29,280
all the sounds inviting your heart also to open

167
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,440
up to lovingly listen to

168
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,000
the not a sound the sound of silence

169
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:48,240
which at some point might present itself as a buzzing or hissing

170
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,159
or not each person's experience is different

171
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:01,799
don't try too hard just be open to all the sounds with your heart

172
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,840
no sound is a problem

173
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:52,480
no noise is a problem just what is in this moment

174
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,080
and this being human

175
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,278
no sound is a problem

176
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:09,640
sounds arising staying for a while maybe passing

177
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,520
silence between the sounds around

178
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,400
the sounds

179
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,320
notice if there is joy arising

180
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,760
listening sounds

181
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:19,200
mind is settling for ambient sounds the sound of the breath

182
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:25,960
the sound of silence vibrations

183
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,120
within and without

184
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:14,240
treat each new sound that arises as a mindfulness bell to bring you back

185
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,799
to the present in case you were lost in thought

186
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:31,398
every sound every noise and mindfulness spell

187
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,840
i'd like to invite you to lean in more

188
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:50,159
to heartful listening as if you're listening to the most beautiful

189
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,039
music your favorite music

190
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,480
the heart can soar

191
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,360
with the amazing with fascinating

192
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:33,760
notes sound silence

193
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,760
reverberations

194
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:36,638
delightfully delicious joyful

195
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,240
notes and silence

196
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:51,440
leaning more into the heart listening to all the sounds

197
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,320
as if ten thousand joys and ten thousand sorrows

198
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,440
ours that of the world

199
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,519
listening with our heart

200
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:04,400
one last invitation what if every sound you hear

201
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:12,960
every noise which we take for granted

202
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
is really an expression

203
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,240
of the divine

204
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,880
of beauty and grace

205
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,640
the music the mysterious music of life

206
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,119
may we all hear with our hearts

207
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,880
thank you for your practice everyone

208
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:28,800
listening with our hearts a different way of approaching this practice

209
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,319
sounds sounds sound of silence

210
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:41,200
sounds internally externally but not a sound

211
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:49,760
sounds is an expression of grace beauty divinity of being human

212
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,838
all that we take for granted

213
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:02,880
so i'd love to hear anything you'd like to share

214
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:10,960
but you noticed what came up for you what insights might have arisen

215
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:19,440
like to share oh mark says angel singing

216
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,160
thank you mark beautiful

217
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:31,359
that's lovely actually i have to say that's a feeling that came up for me also as i

218
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:38,480
was leading this yeah friend and see your hand please

219
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:45,119
well i can't say there were angels singing uh that's that's something i'll

220
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:52,319
like to aspire to but certainly um to the degree to which i understood the

221
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:59,920
direction and i'm not really sure i do i'm not i'm not quite sure

222
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,319
i could find the register right where my heart is to open up

223
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:11,280
but in any case whatever was listening um

224
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:19,040
certainly neutralize the the irritating quality of my tinnitus

225
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,720
uh and then as a comparison outside the door somebody had their

226
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,400
the horn to their car was was blaring rhythmically yeah which was actually

227
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,319
much more annoying than what was in my head

228
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,960
so thank you and i really i really appreciate again you you bringing our direction to this

229
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,760
again i really i really feel your generosity and do that i think

230
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:57,040

i'm absolutely delighted to hear your practice report um

232
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,560
that is the direction that that is my hope that with a shift in perspective as you were

233
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,760
experiencing that it didn't seem that annoying quote-unquote this

234
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,440
tinnitus that's always present that you shared a few weeks ago it's really a lot of suffering and pain and it is

235
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,880
difficult and it just tends to be very hard so thank you for that gift of your

236
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,000
practice that you're sharing with others because also many others both in this sangha and

237
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,400
listening to this audio later your practice can be inspiring for them with the way you're working with your

238
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,599
tinnitus thank you

239
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:52,400

00:43:52,400 --> 00:44:00,800
lovely marie christine says felt it deep into my concentration beautiful yes it does

241
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:07,599

242
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,960

i like the invitation there is nothing wrong with what i'm hearing

247
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,920
it helped me notice my aversion to many sounds and showed how my aversion

248
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,720
closes my heart over and over again thank you violet beautiful

249
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,960
realization inside reflection

250
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:02,560
profound i'll share something from my own practice tonight besides what

251
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:08,720
the sound of angels that set seemed to be coming up as mark said

252
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,160
another one was um the ambient sounds the sound of a

253
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:20,400
motorcycle speeding outside and horns and

254
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:27,280
washing machine or whatever the sounds the sounds are they all actually they start to sound

255
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,400
delightful as i was inviting you to perhaps see if

256
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,319
it's possible to see them for them to to arise as a

257
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,760
sound of divinity i'm alive isn't it amazing there is this there's sound

258
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,200
there's these way sounds there's these waves and my ear can hear them and make

259
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,880
sense of it which is all this amazement this sense of wow

260
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:01,119
the sense of amazement [Music] in the midst of the settling in the

261
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,400
concentration which also mark christine talked about so

262
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:14,880
jia says i hope i'm saying your name right when i learned when i leaned into my heart

263
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,400

291
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:11,040
uh meditation i uh

292
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:17,520
i missed you know i was a little bit late getting here and i missed the first three or four minutes

293
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,680
so but uh um jamie told me that you had

294
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,720
asked us to imagine ourselves in a place that's

295
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,559
perfectly silenced with absolutely quiet and to tune in to what sound we could

296
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:41,440
hear there there and [Music] um when jamie said that i remember that

297
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:49,680
like years ago i i wondered about that so i i rented a sensory deprivation chamber

298
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:55,440
to find a space that was perfectly silent to see you know

299
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:01,440
what i could hear and in there in the dark floating in warm water

300
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:08,400
i could only hear i could hear two sounds i could hear the sound of my heart beating

301
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,599
and i could hear a kind of very faint high humming sound

302
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:20,640
that i interpreted or i imagined it to be the

303
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:27,359
sound of my central nervous system working yeah yeah so

304
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:33,839
since then i have developed tinnitus like other members of the same yeah and the tinnitus sound is not at all like

305
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:40,000
the sound i'm talking about it's it's a different thing yeah right

306
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,400
right yeah yeah i appreciate you sharing that yeah so so i um

307
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,680
might be you might find it of interest later when this becomes available i mean in a

308
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:58,480
little bit i'll upload it into audiodharma to go back and listen to the first few minutes and

309
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,760
uh and it's in some ways the the it's not a

310
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,920
sound the sound of silence could be the one that you hear when there's absolutely no other sound and

311
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,440
it's completely quiet but not necessarily not necessarily so that wasn't

312
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:22,240
it it's one version of the invitation perhaps one could hear that i said but not that's not exactly the invitation

313
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:29,359
it's a little different so yes what you hear in the sensory deprivation could be one version of that but not a sound

314
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:34,720
actually after you start to hear it it's it's kind of a vibration it's everywhere

315
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:42,880
