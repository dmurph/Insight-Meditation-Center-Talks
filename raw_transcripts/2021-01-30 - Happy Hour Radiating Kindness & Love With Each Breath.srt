2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,679
lovely to be with you in this moment in time

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,480
so as we've been continuing to cultivate to go through the categories with metta with a cultivation of

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,240
kindness good will arose by any name can translate to metta

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,279
in so many different ways good will kindness love warmth

6
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,200
friendliness so we've come to the category of all beings

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,320
and diana uh shared meditation on that uh yesterday and i did it on wednesday

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:52,800
so let's linger with it a little more because this can be um it can be a fun and joyous category

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,160
of just spreading good will wishing wishing beings well

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:06,640
and i'm going to use some imagery today to kind of loosen us from our usual conception

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,240
of of well-wishing so my invitation to you is to be playful

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,280
with this not have a sense of should i should be

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:26,400
able to wish well for all beings and everywhere and i'm failing and have a

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,159
playful attitude with it really have a playful attitude

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,040
these practices if we have fun with them then they take hold a lot more

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,520
deeply than if we do them as a grim duty especially wishing well for for all

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,640
beings it's just kind of an easy thing like yeah and see where you're

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,200
you're fine your heart finds connection where your heart feels drawn to

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,520
um what categories in what ways

20
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:13,040
yeah and and one other thing i want to say is um this i i find this particular

21
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,640
practice the well-wishing for all beings to be

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,080
and well it can be expressed in so many different ways it can be heavy it can be light it can be very joyful you

23
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,120
really can't be light it can be happy making especially if you're feeling kind of heavy and and more rose

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,920
it's like okay spend some time wishing well for others and all beings people you don't know you can just imagine them you

25
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,160
can just pull them out of a hat like a magician and wish them well whatever works for you and

26
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,400
and and a practical aspect of this is if you're walking around say if you have you've had a tough day

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,080
and if you go for a walk start wishing well for whomever you come across

28
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,159
when you're walking the path just wish them well and find you'll soon find you're lighter you're smiling you

29
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:09,280
happy you're happier i've done this practice in this way and it's just like oh wow i i feel like i'm walking on clouds now

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,760
it's just your whole perception gets um can can get shifted so don't

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:23,440
fight don't judge yourself like oh it's not working it's not uh just plan c's just

32
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:31,120
you're giving these offerings as if you're giving these offerings offerings to all to these beings you're

33
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,799

206
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:11,040
i think i realized during this meditation that something i've been

207
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:19,200
doing every day when i walk my dog is is like a loving kindness for all

208
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:25,760
beings and i think that's why i've been enjoying it so much

209
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,720
and i started it kind of when covet started and i started making eye contact with

210
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,920
every driver and just i just beam

211
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:46,000
at them because honestly i'm happy to see a person and

212
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,880

213
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:59,599
semi truck drivers wave and i just i just got that feeling when

214
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,880
you were talking and then being the dolphin in the sea and i was like oh no wonder i look

216
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:19,280

225
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:22,480

226
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:29,839
in buddhism and uh zen especially the full moon is a symbol of a fully

227
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:37,920
awakened being so when you talk about that i love the symbolism of the fully awakened heart

yes thank you jerry yeah it feels that way that's all

241
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:04,480
and another reflection here my back was hurting for the first 20 to 30 minutes

242
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:11,119
and it took my body a while to physically let go i felt very tense no problem

243
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:17,440
no problem um and i i'm delighted to hear that you stayed

244
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:25,040
with it you stayed with it and it opened up and you didn't give up after like okay i'm done with this oh

245
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,560
just staying gently staying with it gently staying with it gently staying with it

246
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:36,160
um and and my invitation is if this happens again and if i'm giving instructions about

247
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:42,640
flowers and i don't know fishes then then direct the meta to your hurting back to your hurting

248
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:50,160
back and just invite it to relax it's okay it's loved it's loved it's loved it's all okay can be as tense

249
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,720
and it could be as tight as it wants to don't judge it just love it that's my invitation if this happens for you

250
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:03,599
uh your practitioner or anybody else and jesse your hand back up again okay so this is last reflection we're going

251
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,599
to take go ahead hi thanks for the some great meditation

252
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,880
um yeah for the loving kindness of all beings

253
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:23,280
um it just seems it seems a little bit more open-ended than the other categories and

254
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,800
um do you sort of do you wait for you know and i i pictured you know the

255
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:35,280
occasional animal would come to mind but did do you just wait for them to come or do you try and think about just

256
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:41,520
any being um yeah yeah yeah

257
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,760
that's an excellent question um it can be either way and there there's no right or wrong way

258
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,440
to practice this um and sometimes it might make sense i think i did that on wednesday to kind of

259
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,560
went through the categories you know all the beings that are hop and swim and you're like kind of bringing

260
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:04,319
categories and thinking about all the beings in that category and some other times it could just be kind of like open

261
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:12,240
and you know north south east west whatever beings who show up oh people who live in

262
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,440
middle east just showed up oh may you be well you know uh all the birds in africa just showed up

263
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:24,319
well maybe so so either way either way and you can choose and and you might find your heart in

264
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:30,319
some sessions is drawn to one versus another way but there's no right or wrong it's all cultivation

265
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:37,760
practices yeah okay is that okay jesse yeah great and

266
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:45,040
question last question uh jerry asks does the bee does the being need to be sentient um

267
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:51,920
um yes and no i think in in buddhist practice we go with sentient it's like may all sentient

268
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,119
beings be well all the beings that have consciousness and then i think sometimes it's okay to

269
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:03,760
to extend that and and extend it to plants and on mother earth

270
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,359
and there's a sense of embracing gaia this life energy life force that that moves through

271
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:16,000
all living beings so it so it doesn't have to be sentient in my

272
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,200
opinion but you can practice either way so

273
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:27,040
so dear ones let's practice together in in communities spreading our good

274
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:33,599
will and and the invitation so the invitation as you as we go into groups is the first minute

275
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:40,079
actually for the free don't hop off just yet practice check this out for the first minute actually don't say

276
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:45,440

277
