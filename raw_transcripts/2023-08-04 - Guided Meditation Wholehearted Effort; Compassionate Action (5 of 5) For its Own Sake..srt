1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:05,460
so good morning hello

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,959
good afternoon for those of you elsewhere and

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,720
good evening so

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,000
in preparation for this meditation practice

5
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:31,199
who I think a wonderful principle for engaging in meditation

6
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,559
is to have some confidence in the instruction what we're what

7
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,620
you're doing in meditation to have some confidence that what you're

8
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,000
doing in meditation is wholesome it's healthy it's a good thing to do

9
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,280
and then to do it wholeheartedly

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:04,140
and wholeheartedly does not mean you know to make superhuman effort to strain or any kind of way

11
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:11,700
it can mean to give yourself over to the activity so that that's all you're doing

12
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,920
almost as you give yourself over to the activity so fully that you become the

13
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,740
activity almost or you know your self-consciousness and self-conscious

14
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:29,600
concerns Fall Away concerns about other things in other places other times

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:37,140
Falls away and it's akin to doing a hobby or reading a book or

16
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,380
playing a musical instrument or involved in maybe sports or play of some kind

17
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:50,759
where you give yourself over fully to the activity and that's part of why it's so refreshing it's kind of like all the

18
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,340
stresses of Life are preoccupations of life fall away and you're just kind of doing

19
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,340
the activity you're fully becoming the activity almost because you're give yourself to it

20
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,580
and it's possible to do this with meditation to give yourself over to to being

21
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:15,000
mindful to being present for breathing present for your body Here and Now

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,459
to enter into almost like you're entering into a new world

23
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:27,720
for the period of the meditation and you enter into that world fully

24
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,959
you step into it with leaving nothing behind

25
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,420
and so there's a kind of self-forgetting that can happen in a wholehearted effort

26
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:46,200
or this healthy kind of absorption or engagement in what we're doing

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,920
and um and it's possible with meditation and the deeper one goes in meditation the

28
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,220
more that meditation has that flavor that characteristic that giving ourselves that we kind of

29
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,160
there's a self-forgetting um you know all the different ways

30
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:14,220
self-conscious ways we can be in favor of fully being here

31
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:21,739
so to begin this wholehearted effort

32
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,200
to assume care take it to care in your meditation

33
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,540
posture so that you're doing it in some wholehearted way

34
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:40,140
like this is the posture that in which you're going to be not only alert than

35
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:46,400
aware mindful but you're going to have a posture that

36
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:54,480
manifest that engagement that alertness people people sitting in a chair or

37
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,180
sitting the floor it might mean sitting with a straighter back

38
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,720
sitting in such a way that the whole torso feels alert present

39
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,120
at a relaxed attention

40
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,880
if you're laying on your back or laying down to it

41
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:26,100
there might be ways of aligning your body maybe so it's more aligned more centered

42
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,979
that also gives you a feeling of being more attentive

43
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:38,880
maybe pulling up the knees if the legs are straight out or maybe

44
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:46,080
with your elbows on the you know being supported by whatever you're in bed or couch or floor have

45
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,020
your forearm pointing to the ceiling or both forearms pointing to the ceiling

46
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:58,080
so that there's some effort and engagement it could be adjusting the upper back so

47
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,320
that the chest somehow feels more open

48
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,979
and maybe the shoulders a little bit kind of can

49
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,860
be turned down and back along the back

50
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,960
in whatever posture you have to close your eyes

51
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,300
and take a few moments to appreciate that the

52
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,340
the meditation Temple the temple the

53
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,600
Sanctuary for meditation is this body

54
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,360
and to enter into this body where else would you be

55
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,600
sometimes we're in our thoughts that take us away from any

56
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,060
direct connect connection to our body

57
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,280
taking a few long slow deep breaths

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,960
relaxing as you exhale

59
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:35,360
taking a deep inhale and maybe on the exhale saying the word here

60
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,240
as you settle into enter into here and now

61
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:02,180
and then letting your breathing return to normal

62
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,240
to further relax the body and mind

63
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,479
and as you relax the body and mind on the exhale

64
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,440
let it be a kind of slipping in to the body

65
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:35,840
relaxing and settling into this body

66
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,840
as the playground as the temple

67
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:48,139
as the instrument musical instrument you're going to play

68
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,900
and then entering into the world of breathing

69
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:32,279
they call it a world of breathing is that the body's experience of breathing it's

70
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:40,380
multifaceted many Sensations come into play parts of

71
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,080
the body different parts of the body move as you breathe

72
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,399
breathing is connected to our emotional life

73
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:02,760
to the ways that we're thinking and to enter into kind of a curiosity

74
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,339
and simplicity

75
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:14,360
to be with the breathing whatever way it is

76
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,140
whether being with is so complete there's no room for judging anything or

77
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:28,560
wanting anything things don't have to be different

78
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,000
just this breath

79
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:51,660
so fully with this inhale that there is no future and past

80
00:09:51,660 --> 00:10:00,000
and how we think or imagine just the inhale by itself

81
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,240
without any comparison to what it should be like

82
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,680
wholeheartedly being mindful

83
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,560
of how it is

84
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:24,779
allowing it to be as it is and you just

85
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,500
aware

86
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,920
the exhale experience of exhaling with no future

87
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,260
and past no concern about

88
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,839
trying to do something or get anywhere getting concentrated

89
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:55,560
just the Simplicity of entering into the world of one exhale

90
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:03,899
allowing it to be as it is so fully in the breath and in the exhale

91
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:09,500
there's no room for judging it or wanting it be different

92
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,579
whether it's comfortable or uncomfortable

93
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:27,200
makes no difference for the attention that attends

94
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,680
to the body breathing

95
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,740
if you find yourself thinking notice how that takes you away from

96
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:21,319
breathing from the body and see if you can reverse the direction

97
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,440
of entering into the body and breathing

98
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,800
giving yourself fully over to the simple activity of breathing

99
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,940
to being mindful of what is Here and Now

100
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,140
foreign

101
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:47,419
and then the last couple of minutes of this setting can you in some way

102
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:55,559
surrender into the practice of presence attention Here

103
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:00,960
and Now as if this is the most important thing

104
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,299
to do a caring for oneself caring for the

105
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:12,659
world even through being fully present to your experience

106
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:20,940
not straining but giving yourself over to being attentive

107
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,679
so fully that self-concern falls away

108
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:20,000
perhaps more often than we realize

109
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:26,700
self-concern is a source of stress

110
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,679
tension suffering

111
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:44,419
to drop self-concern in front of instant

112
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:52,940
for instead to live fully present here in our experience

113
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,120
and experience a happiness and freedom from that self-concern

114
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:16,100
and maybe realizing some people all over the world

115
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,520
suffer because of their self-preoccupation

116
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:32,820
attachments and wants and diversions

117
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:38,600
and to wish for all beings

118
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:46,260
to be free from that form of self-concern self-preoccupation

119
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,659
which is stressful and unhelpful

120
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,720
may all beings be happy

121
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,620
may they be safe

122
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,080
from painful self-preoccupation

123
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:14,120
may they experience the peace

124
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:20,299
when stressful self-concern has fallen away

125
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,240
may they be free

126
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:34,279
from all the attachments related to self oneself

127
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,460
may all beings be happy

128
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,589
[Music]

129
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:09,020
so thank you thank you for spending this time together

130
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,860
foreign

131
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:19,640
talk on compassionate action and um

132
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:30,080
that kind of that the focus of the talk is compassionate action for its own sake

133
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,940
compassion that action is often considered to be focused on the welfare

134
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,159
of others sometimes there's self-compassion

135
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,320
and sometimes there's a caring for oneself as one has compassionate care

136
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:52,460
for others it's possible to have compassionate

137
00:32:52,460 --> 00:33:00,600
action care for both self and others and have an open-hearted open vision of

138
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:07,020
how to be in this world that we wish that everyone benefit to

139
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:13,039
everyone be free not just the parties involved or something

140
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:18,779
and there's a fifth kind of way of compassionate action

141
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:26,399
that for some Buddhist Traditions is considered to be the highest Pinnacle of compassion

142
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:32,039
and that is where they were so involved so engaged in the

143
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:37,260
compassionate action that there's a self-forgetting

144
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:42,419
and not sacrificing our own well-being

145
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:49,799
but because we know how to care in a healthy way for the world and ourselves it's it's

146
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:55,440
appropriate it's a beautiful thing to then do in that healthy way of being to

147
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:02,159
give ourselves over to it completely so that uh it's that you have self being

148
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:08,280
the agent of the activity kind of Falls away in some Buddhist Traditions they talk

149
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,520
about the Oneness of the compassionate person the

150
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,679
recipient of compassion and the act itself of compassion

151
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:27,300
that there's a cycle there's a kind of a a unit of kind of

152
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:35,878
of it's Inseparable or has no division or somehow we are immersed in it so that we

153
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:41,339
don't have so much the thoughts of it's me being compassionate we're helping

154
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:47,520
another person and even the idea that this is a compassion action can fall away once we

155
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:54,200
once we have decided that this is the right thing to do we give ourselves over to it fully

156
00:34:54,200 --> 00:35:00,240
and there's a Simplicity and a freedom in the action then

157
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,780
and this is true for anything we do um

158
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,940
if you wash dishes in the sink and certainly there can be a lot of

159
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:18,119
self-preoccupation like I don't like doing the dishes I wish I didn't have to do it I'm always doing it it's not fair

160
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:24,060
or you know I have important things to do let's get this over quickly because I have to get to to do something that I

161
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:29,880
really want to do so there's a lot of self-concerns of different types there it might be

162
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,760
concerns about being the best dishwasher in the neighborhood and trying to prove yourself that everyone knows that you're

163
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,339
a good dishwasher there's also just washing dishes for the sake of washing dishes

164
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:46,740
and there's a kind of giving oneself over fully to the dishwashing that there

165
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:53,300
is no resistance there's a full participation and there's no judgment and no

166
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,500
self-concern in washing my dishes maybe no one's in the house with you so you

167
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:04,619
know he's not trying to prove anything to anyone and so this kind of giving yourself over to an activity

168
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:10,079
is a healthy activity is one of the

169
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:17,760
qualities of Freedom or happiness or Delight that as I said before is akin to

170
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,980
um you know became being absorbed and reading a good book or absorbed involved doing a hobby

171
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:29,220
doing art playing music and involved in his Sports perhaps or

172
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:34,560
all kinds of things that were we really kind of almost forget ourselves in the activity

173
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:41,460
and there might still be a lot of attention and monitoring of what's Happening Here and adjusting ourselves

174
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,560
but it's not kind of through the ordinary filter of Me Myself and mine

175
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,680
and self-concerned self-preoccupation what's in it for me

176
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,680
so this is one one way of if we're talking about compassionate action

177
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:04,560
it's it's uh it's one of the beautiful ways to practice compassionate action is

178
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:12,780
to have learned how to give yourself to something fully to participate fully so certain kind of

179
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:19,920
wind drag of self self-concern is not there there's a kind of refreshment refreshing

180
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,740
way and refresh refreshing that comes from dropping the self-concerns this

181
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:31,859
it's a lot of stress that many people have around me myself and mine and what's in it for me and what's going to

182
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:39,420
happen to me and what do people think and well people still like me and and am I doing it right am I doing it wrong and

183
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:46,760
you know do I need to apologize I'm sorry oh that is wind drag all that is kind of

184
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:54,900
interfering with kind of in a simple could be simple relaxed way doesn't have to be vigorous or forceful but in a

185
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:01,140
simple relaxed way to give ourselves over to the activity at hand and in this case the topic for this week is

186
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:06,660
compassionate action and this is uh maybe often not

187
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:13,440
associated with compassion and action because the emphasis is in helping someone who's suffering

188
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,940
uh they actually the emphasis is doing something but but uh you know

189
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:26,160
and there can even come a sense of obligation and responsibility it's up to me I have to do it I'm the one who's

190
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,040
going to help and and all that is wind drag all that adds

191
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:38,520
stress and if you've decided this is healthy the way and this is why all the things

192
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:44,700
we've been teaching I've been teaching over these last weeks about compassion all the different component parts of it

193
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:52,200
all the things that can come together to inform compassion a well-developed capacity for awareness

194
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,780
a well-developed capacity for Attunement to others and to oneself to the situation

195
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:03,300
a well-developed capacity for appreciation and respect for others

196
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:09,900
a well-developed capacity for considering what we Aspire what's the wish we want that goes along with

197
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:17,880
compassion what's the healthy aspiration and all those things then come together

198
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,160
in the in the action that we do and then we also consider what's their

199
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,260
right action which is kind of is the principles I offered earlier in the week

200
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:34,560
but when all these come together in maybe kind of over time to develop a

201
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:41,820
second nature and they don't have a lot of consideration and thoughts about it but uh then we can at some point we give

202
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:47,520
ourselves over to the activity at hand driving someone to the emergency and

203
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,940
those you're just there for that activity bringing someone in or cooking someone dinner who's sick

204
00:39:53,940 --> 00:40:02,160
spending time with someone who is somehow in crisis and going for a walk

205
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:08,880
with them or sitting with them and listening to them um putting a Band-Aid on a small child's

206
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:18,420
knee who scraped it there's all kinds of ways in which we can be compassionate the action but at some point to

207
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:24,180
give over or to do it fully a wholeheartedness of full participation

208
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:31,320
so that self-preoccupation falls away and the advantage of that for compassion

209
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:37,440
action is I believe that then the compassion action can be clean it can be

210
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,740
unclouded it can be on agitated by things which are not

211
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:49,560
compassion more often than not self-concerned self-preocupation is not

212
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:54,720
you know as a hindrance for the purposes of compassion

213
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,540
and also then uh the compassionate action becomes a vehicle for our own

214
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:05,579
Freedom their freedom from self we learn so much about letting go when

215
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:11,880
we give ourselves over wholeheartedly to participate in healthy activities

216
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,220
so um so it's kind of the you know the

217
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:23,280
culmination of this week of talking about compassionate action is to come to

218
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,579
a point where compassionate action is done for its own sake

219
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:36,060
of course preceding it is the idea we're doing it for the sake of others or for ourselves or all those other things but

220
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:41,339
at some point we just kind of as we're doing it we can just let go of all those

221
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:47,579
thoughts and concerns and just give ourselves over to the Simplicity of the act that we're doing

222
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:54,240
and in doing so we benefit ourselves in a fantastic way we benefit ourselves by

223
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:02,820
getting a taste of freedom freedom of freedom from self and and then I think the Joy or the

224
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:10,260
happiness that can come with compassion has a chance has the most chance to flower and develop

225
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:17,420
and that's one of the great things about compassion is the way that it can be a

226
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:23,940
source of Happiness source of joy a source of well-being source of being

227
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:30,980
on the path to Freedom so um

228
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,119
so that's uh

229
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:45,839
my thoughts about compassionate action for this week and so I've been now it depends how we

230
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:51,240
count but the last six seven maybe eight weeks that I've

231
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:57,420
been doing these these YouTube teachings it's all been kind of focused around

232
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:04,500
compassion and I'm hoping that it's it's enriched you in understanding it's different aspects different

233
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:10,440
streams of of attention that we are or reflection about compassion that we

234
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:16,380
can bring to it to really enrich this world so that we don't think of compassion as

235
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:22,859
a in simplistic ways that we just jump to act as you know compassionate way without giving any

236
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:28,380
thought to the the multifaceted and valuable kind of richness that the

237
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:36,420
compassionate world is part of and um and uh so it's possible this is the last

238
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:41,700
week on this topic I'll be gone for two weeks and we have wonderful guests

239
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:46,859
coming for the next two weeks and um and I don't know what I'll do when I come

240
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:54,839
back I mean maybe I'll consider us two weeks more about compassion the follow-up on compassion

241
00:43:54,839 --> 00:44:00,240
maybe there's a post-compassionate topic to talk about

242
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,720
so I don't know so so or I'll start a new topic so we'll see

243
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:14,099
and uh thank you very very much and I appreciate so much that the chance to explore this topic with you all for

244
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:21,380
these weeks and and um I look forward to do more more of it thank you
