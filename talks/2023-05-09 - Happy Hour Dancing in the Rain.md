Hello friends, hello and welcome to Happy Hour. My name is Nikki, in Mountain View, California, on unceded Ohlone land[^1]. As we always do, we start Happy Hour by saying hello, warming up the space with our greetings and *metta*[^2].

(A period of silent meditation and greeting follows.)

Alright, we're going to declare the space warmed up with our *metta* and hellos to each other. We have a low-traffic mailing list, and if you are new to Happy Hour, you're warmly invited to become a member of the Google Group, where information, links, and poems are shared. It's a way to keep in contact with the *Sangha*[^3].

At this time, I change the settings so that accidental unmuting won't be possible, and chat will only come to me as the host. I ask you to keep that channel quiet during the guided meditation and the little *dharmette*[^4], because it can be very distracting to receive chats while I'm teaching, but I'll open it up afterwards. Last but not least, I will turn on the recording for the sake of Audio Dharma.

### Dancing in the Rain

Hello and welcome, everyone. It's lovely to see you. It makes me happy to see you and for us to come together to practice. What a beautiful way to spend our time—to cultivate kindness, goodwill, and presence for this very life, this life that seems to keep passing very, very quickly. Impermanence, in full force, full regalia. Impermanence arising and passing every moment of our life.

I wanted to bring a couple of quotes for us to play with tonight. They have to do with the passage of time and how we show up for our lives—the way we intend to show up for ourselves and for others.

The first is by Alan Saunders:
> "Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans."

Another one is from Vivian Green:
> "Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass; it's about learning to dance in the rain."

And here is a third one by Anonymous:
> "Life is what happens when you're busy worrying about the future."

I want to bring these in with the invitation not for us to worry about the future and let life pass us by, but to actually notice if we have that tendency to be worrying about the future, to not really be present with our lives. That's the invitation: to land in our seats and be present for this beautiful, amazing, mysterious, challenging thing called our lives. Can we be present for it? Not waiting for the storm to pass, bracing ourselves for it to pass, but can we learn to dance in the rain with kindness, with patience, with generosity, with gratitude, with spaciousness for ourselves and for others? It's about shifting our relationship to the way we show up for our lives, for the sake of ourselves and others. This is a theme we explore at Happy Hour: cultivating kindness, compassion, and gratitude in these practices of the heart, regularly.

This is another way of leaning into presence, being present with kindness and spaciousness for what is, instead of bracing for it to be over. Can we celebrate the fullness, the busyness, the being as things are, even if they are not exactly what we would want them to be? They're here already. Can we be present for them with spaciousness and even a sense of celebration?

Okay, I think I've said enough to set the stage. I will bring these themes in as we meditate together. Let's arrive. Let's land in our bodies and start meditating.

### Guided Meditation

Arriving in this body, in this moment in time. We invite our feet, our legs, to rest on this Earth. If you're sitting on a chair, let the bottom of both feet rest onto the earth. If on a cushion, the underside of our legs and our bottom on the cushion or the chair. Relaxing, releasing, arriving fully. Taking your seat, both figuratively and literally, on this Earth, in this moment. Taking our seat.

Taking our seat on the earth in this present moment. Experience comes and goes as if there was a revolving door of comings and goings. And yet, it's as if we were just resting, standing by this revolving door of experience, planting ourselves in the present moment, watching the flow of the comings and goings. We don't have to accompany them and travel with them, but just rest right here by this open revolving door.

Can we be a kind, patient, wise witness, an attendant at this revolving door of the present moment?

Let the breath, the movement of the breath, the sensations of the breath in the body, be a support to hang by this revolving door of the present moment. The breath can be like a friend who supports us. We can lean on the breath to be more present for the risings and passings, leaning into the breath with spaciousness.

Release thoughts from the past, plans for the future, worries in this moment. They can be released. Trust that the past is already gone. If we can be present, fully present, cultivating wisdom and kindness in the present moment, the future will take care of itself when it becomes the present moment. Can we be here, right here, right now, supported by this friend, our breath? In-breath, out-breath. Spacious, present.

Sitting by the revolving door of now-ness. The revolving door of arising and passing. The door is always now. It's always now. Can we just release, open our hands for a moment, and appreciate, take delight in this moment's presence, a sense of full presence?

Perhaps you can imagine yourself, if you like, as an attendant standing by a revolving door—a friendly, kind attendant who has goodwill and smiles at whatever passes through. Arriving, passing, moving through, greeting all phenomena with an open, friendly heart of goodwill. Not attaching, getting clingy, jamming up the door. Not joining any travelers moving to the future or the past, but just staying right here at the revolving door of the present.

If you find the mind is wandering, not a problem. No worries. It's okay; this is what minds do. Gently invite awareness to come and rest with the breath, resting with the present moment. It's most restful right here. Resting in the presence with a smile, greeting all visitors that come and go in this moment, all phenomena passing through. And if it gets overwhelming at any point, with so much passing through, just stay with the breath. Just resting with the breath.

Being present for our life in this moment, this passing moment. Resting with the breath, with kindness and goodwill for ourselves, for whatever is arising.

If there is currently a storm in your life, challenges, is it possible to imagine yourself, just for a moment, dancing in the rain? Learning to dance in the rain, instead of bracing yourself for the storm to pass. Is that possible? If not, it's okay, don't push it. Maybe the heart opens for just a second in some way to see yourself embracing what's difficult, what's challenging, being rained on, being soaked, being undaunted by the deluge. Can there be a connection, even for just one second, a sense of uplift or joy in the midst of this rain, this storm, this deluge? Getting soaked.

Here. In this moment, this passing, spacious moment.

As we bring this practice to a close, feel into this metaphor one more time. If there are challenges, rainstorms, can we connect with the freedom of getting soaked, dancing, singing in this rain, even for a moment? If it's available. If not, it's okay.

Letting that go, connect with the metaphor of sitting, resting with the breath—in-breath and out-breath—at the revolving door of experience. Spaciously present. Here. Not leaving our post, going after experience into the future or the past. Spaciously, just here. With kindness and goodwill for ourselves and for everything and everyone that passes through these gates, these doors of awareness.

As we cultivate and plant seeds of presence and kindness, may we meet ourselves with goodwill. May we meet whatever arises with goodwill, even if they're challenges, with spaciousness, as much as possible. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free, including ourselves.

Thank you, everyone. Thanks for your practice.

### Reflections

As I mentioned, we were working with a couple of themes. One was this metaphor of sitting by the revolving door of the present moment, of now-ness. It can be a very helpful metaphor sometimes, greeting everything that passes through with a smile, instead of having a sense of aversion or clinging.

The other was this: can we, for a moment, have the sense of dancing in the rain? The quotes I shared at the beginning connected to the practice today. One by Alan Saunders: "Life is what happens to us while we're making other plans." The invitation was to be right here with the revolving door of experience instead of accompanying some experience into the past or future, as a training. Of course, it might have happened a hundred times during this practice that you did that, but we do it as a planting of seeds, as a training.

And this other quote by Vivian Green: "Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass but about learning to dance in the rain." It's funny because a few days ago, I was listening to this AI-generated playlist of songs, and something that came up was the song "Singin' in the Rain." I hadn't listened to it for a long time. I thought, "Oh yeah, what an interesting, happy song," this concept of singing in the rain. I think the lyrics were something like, "Singin' in the rain, oh I'm happy again... I'm singin' in the rain." How interesting, right? Imagining us embracing the rains of our lives and just dancing and singing in the rain.

Our practice, and what the Buddha taught with so many similes and metaphors—my goodness, the *suttas*[^5] are filled with very helpful similes. These metaphors really open us up to possibility. Instead of just "be with the in-breath, be with the out-breath"—yes, those instructions are very helpful and prescriptive—metaphors can be so helpful to open our hearts and minds to possibilities that we might not relate to as readily if they were only prescriptive. Same with poems.

So with that, I'd like to invite us now to take advantage of practicing with the community, with the Happy Hour community in small groups. The prompt for small group practice tonight is this: Was there something about working with either of these metaphors that you found supportive or opening? Or was there something particularly challenging? You're welcome to share from your own experience what arose, or you can say "pass" and just be part of the group and hold silent, kind presence for yourself and others.

(Instructions for breakout groups follow.)

### Q&A

Welcome back, everyone. We have some time now for reflections, questions, comments. How was that practice for you? What did you discover?

**Lisa:** I found myself kind of teetering. It was really obvious what was coming up for me in the revolving door. It was this kind of emotional tangle of things that I was being with, but I was teetering between noticing a little resistance to it, and then going into it, being in it, versus having a friendly, kind space around it. And so it was like, when it was passing at the end, I was like, "Is it really going? I don't know, am I sure?" It was that nuance. Do you have any instruction or guidance around being *in* the thing versus kind of coming out into a space around it? I guess I associate that with the singing or dancing part, and then the rain maybe is my direct emotional thing that's happening.

**Nikki:** Yeah, beautiful. I so appreciate the way you described it. This is lovely, that you observed that at some point you're in the midst of it, you're entangled, you're in the revolving door hanging out with all the things coming and going. And then there was some spaciousness that happened, like, "Oh yeah, it's coming and going, but there's some spaciousness of presence." And you associate that with the ease of dancing in the rain, being with the difficulties. You described that transition beautifully yourself. In terms of any guidance or support, I think leaning into the breath a little bit, leaning into the present moment, can allow that spaciousness. But also, observing what you just observed—that there's a difference between the mode of being entangled with it and the mode where it's still arising, but there's just a little bit of space for observing it. I think you already have it. I'm just basically affirming the wisdom you already have and the way you engaged with it wisely yourself. It's quite lovely.

**Pietro:** Thank you for the meditation and the theme of the passage of time. I was just reflecting in the group how much time I spend in planning and worrying, so that's very humbling. But I also sometimes have this experience of just boredom. It happened today a lot at work. There was just boredom coming up, and it's kind of like you want time to go faster in those cases. And it's really sad because, as you were reminding us, our time is so limited, and yet there are these times when you actually want it to go faster. It's not pleasant to be in boredom. I was just wondering if you had any suggestions or ideas on how to be with boredom, especially when you're at work and maybe it's not as easy to just engage in a different activity.

**Nikki:** Yeah, beautiful. Thank you so much for bringing this up. This is so important, kind of the other side of the coin. There's a range of human experience. We realize we're spending so much time thinking and we're losing out on the moment, and then we're losing out on the moment because we want it to end. It's a different way of wanting it to end. Either we're in some difficulty and bracing for the challenge to pass, or it's boring. The mind is relating to the present moment by pushing it away, wishing for a future moment. And then when the future moment comes, we've just missed out.

Boredom is such an interesting experience. It's not so much about what is happening, but it's the relationship of our minds to what is happening. I will venture to say there is nothing that is inherently boring, including sitting with your eyes closed doing nothing. As meditators, we know we can sit with our eyes quiet and nothing is happening, and yet it's interesting. The mind can become more curious and subtle about the subtle risings and passings in the mind and the body, just really studying, turning the awareness to itself.

So, how can whatever it is that you're doing be boring? I'm going to recommend two things. One is to bring curiosity and interest to the act itself, to whatever is deemed boring. "Can I learn more? Can I do this with panache? Can I do this with alacrity, with interest, with joy, with a spirit of service?" You can bring a lot of different attitudes in to just explore, to keep learning about yourself and the task.

The other whole area is to become curious about the boredom itself. Be really curious. "What is happening? What are the words? What is the message right now that this is boring? I don't want to be doing this." "Oh, really? Okay, well tell me why. What's boring about it?" Let's explore this together. Explore how boredom feels in the body, in the mind. The moment you learn to become curious about boredom, you are never bored. It's fascinating. It rarely comes up for me that I'm bored, and yet there are some moments where the mind's like, "Oh, bored." And I think, "Oh, really? Let's explore what this mind state is that says 'boring'." I'm curious about this mind state. Any moment in life becomes fascinating.

Does that make sense, Pietro? Be curious with boredom, and then you're not bored anymore. And also challenge yourself with whatever task there is, with the attitude and with different ways to learn and serve. Is this task to serve others? Are there other human beings that are impacted? How can you relate to this task to find more meaning, more interest in it?

Thank you all. This has been such an interesting period of practice. Someone chatted to me, "Singin' in the Rain is an energizing song." It sure is. So may you bring that in as an inspiration. Thank you all, and thank you for your practice, for your cultivation. May all beings be well. May all beings be free, including ourselves. Thanks, everyone.
