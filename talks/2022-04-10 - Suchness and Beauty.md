So, welcome everyone, here in person and online. I appreciate so much the chance to come together for this purpose that we have and to share the dharma. With this pandemic, it's been two years since I've taught my unusual Intro to Meditation class. I would sometimes teach it two or three times a year, and maybe since it's been so long, I'd like to do a demonstration that I often do at the end of the intro class. Some of you have seen it, but I think it'll be done a little bit differently than usual.

It has to do with holding up a flower. There is an important Zen story that the Zen tradition began when the Buddha held up a flower and a particular monk, Mahākāśyapa,¹ smiled. The Buddha saw the smile and then recognized him as a successor, a teacher, and he then passed the lineage on down through the centuries until it came to the modern world. This little story is a bit of a kōan,² some kind of contemplative question for everyone: What was it that... why did the Buddha just hold up a flower? And why did the monk smile? And why was his smiling so significant?

I can't exactly answer that, or maybe the talk is an answer to it. But I just appreciate so much that when we see this flower, maybe we see the *suchness* of the flower. The flower is being held up by itself, and so it's alone. It's just the flower. It's a nasturtium, as some of you might know, and it has a particular color and number of petals. It's just allowed to be itself in the moment. So, one way of talking about that is to call it the suchness of the flower; it just is itself.

But I can do something interesting with it, and that is I could hold up another flower. If you can see it, there's a little yellow flower next to the nasturtium. Now we can say something we couldn't say before: we can say that nasturtium is the *big* flower, and this little composite is the *small* flower. Now it's not just the suchness of the flower by itself; the suchness now exists in our minds in relationship to the other flower. I'm pretty confident that these flowers, if they looked at each other, are not thinking about each other and are not comparing each other. It doesn't occur to one that, "I'm the big one," and, "Oh no, I'm the small one," or something.

But then we could do something very interesting again. I could put down the small flower, and I can pick up this flower, a rose. Now something very interesting has happened: what was the big flower before has now become the small flower. You bring up a big rose next to the nasturtium, and the nasturtium is the smaller flower. That contrast, that comparison of the two of these flowers, does not exist in the flower itself. It's a provisional interpretation; it's a provisional label that comes out of the comparative mind that sees one as being different than the other. So this, what was big, now has become small.

A tremendous amount of human suffering comes from comparisons: comparing ourselves to ideals we don't live up to, or ideals we do live up to, and now everyone else should live up to them. People compare themselves to each other. Sometimes the comparison is that I'm not as much 'x' as someone else. People suffer because of ageism; people who are older will often comment on how they're now ignored or not treated well, or sometimes they're treated in ways that they wish they weren't because they're seen in some kind of category of being old and incapable. People suffer because of their size, their hair color, the length of their hair, their skin color, ethnicity—all kinds of things that people do to compare each other and make judgments about the value of one over another.

We compare ourselves to who we were before. "Before I was young, and now I'm not, and I wish I were still young." Or, "Now I'm not as [zestful?] as I was before." Now I'm wrinkled, rather than thinking, "beautiful people don't have any wrinkles whatsoever." I grew up with a friend of my parents, a woman who apparently never smiled because she was attempting not to get any wrinkles.

But what about the suchness of the human being? What about your suchness? Is there such a thing where you can be held up like a flower and you're allowed just to be as you are, in the perfection of suchness, in the simplicity of suchness, without any comparisons at all? What's the beauty of each of us, of each of you? In what way are you a flower? In what way are you perfect, wonderful, as you are? Is that valuable? Is that somehow sentimental or Pollyannish or not really realistic? Because we should be comparing ourselves, or those comparisons are real, or they're not real but they're imposed on me. The world around me is constantly making comparisons, and I don't feel safe in the world because of what people are doing and their comparisons against me. And so to emphasize the suchness of us, maybe that just allows the status quo to be there, and the status quo is harmful.

Is that the case? Or is there some valuable way where we can appreciate our own suchness? Can we gaze upon ourselves in such a way that the gaze does not have any comparative thinking? We're not compared to before or to after, to even wonderful ideals. We're not compared to other people. It's just the simplicity of who we are, in a way that maybe we allow the flower to be itself.

Now, it's possible in the course of a flower being a flower, and maybe beginning to gather its forces together to focus on making seeds, that a wind comes along and it blows off a petal. Now we have something new in this world that maybe wasn't as clear as before: now we have the suchness of the petal. And the petal is just allowed to be itself; it's a beautiful petal just by itself. Another option is to look at the flower that's still here and believe that the essence of a flower, that we have to maintain at all costs, are the petals—all the petals. And if a flower loses a petal, it's no longer perfect, it's no longer right. But is that the case? The natural course of things is that the petals fall off and a seed is made. Why do we carry with us the idea of the perfectly full and blossomed flower with all its petals as the only suchness of the flower? Can't it be that as it begins to lose its petals, it's just as much in its suchness as it was before?

This rose that came from the grounds of IMC here is already withering. You maybe can't see it here, but some of the petals are beginning to curl up and turn brown and will probably fall off soon. It's possible to see it as starting to become ugly. But is there a way of seeing this that is seeing it neither as ugly nor as beautiful, but just the suchness of it? Or is it possible to see beauty in its decay? After all, it's just the natural process which it takes. The suchness of it—maybe everything is beautiful. Maybe everything is beautiful in its suchness. Maybe wrinkles are beautiful. I've seen people with an exquisite face full of cobweb wrinkles, and I literally thought, "Wow, that is beautiful. There's something special about it." And I've seen people with just a little bit of wrinkles—wow, that's beautiful. And I've seen faces with no wrinkles—wow, that's beautiful. Why not see it all as beautiful? Why do we have these judgments, these comparisons, these ideas?

If we take a flower and we single one part of the flower out as being the most important part, as being the thing that really counts, and we're going to protect that at all cost, we're going to be upset if it's not there anymore. Maybe for this flower, what's most important is that it has supported by these beautiful green leaves. But then someone comes along and takes it, or it falls off. "But, but, but... that's what made the flower a flower!" Or maybe it's a long stem. Maybe the length of the stem, the longer it is, is what makes a flower a successful flower. But then somehow or other the flower is made shorter. "Oh no! I was so attached to it being long, that's what really made it a flower." And then the petals start falling off for the people who thought that petals were the essence, the most important part of the flower. "Let's glue it back on!" You know, they sell petals at the local craft store, and it's important to make the flower perfect, so let's go buy some other petals and glue them on when they're falling off. These are all kind of silly examples, but don't we do this to ourselves? Aren't we judging ourselves and selecting parts of ourselves out as being what's important and what needs to be held up and made to be the way it is?

But aren't we innocent in doing this? Or isn't it inevitable we do this when the world around us is doing it? The social world, the people, the advertisements—they're all doing it, and they're all holding up a certain way that's supposed to be the ideal and the right way. And then people behave that way, and people do judge each other. And if they're judging each other, they might judge me. And if they're judging me, then I don't feel safe. And so I better figure out the right length of hair that an acceptable person is supposed to have. I better figure out the right something, this and that. And people do make adjustments to themselves. I know people like myself have moved between cultures, and then there were different standards, and then you kind of figure out, how do I fit in here? And what is expected? And what clothes, and what ways of speaking, and what ways of being, and all kinds of things.

Once we get into all this complicated social world, it's sometimes difficult not to be pulled into this world of selecting parts out of the whole. And maybe it's reason to protest, maybe it's reason to stand up and point these kinds of terrible things out that go on. But what about the suchness? Is that going to be eclipsed? Does that never have a place? Is there a time and place where we can appreciate the suchness of ourselves, of the flower, or the situation, the suchness of a moment in time? Or are we always on the treadmill that keeps going on and on, of the mind involved in the activity of comparative thinking, the mind involved in not seeing the simplicity of the moment, not seeing how much suchness is here in some wonderful way?

The treadmill is that kind of going and going and going, churning away, thinking, wondering. And I think sometimes meditators, especially when they begin, or maybe anytime, it's possible to be in awe at the treadmill in which the mind is just thinking and comparison, stories and ideas and concerns, and the thoughts just keep going and going. But it's not necessary to live that way all the time. Just like it's important to eat, it's usually not a good idea to eat non-stop. But the mind somehow can go non-stop, just churning away. And even if some of that churning and thinking and reflection is important, it doesn't need to be continuous.

So we come to meditation, I think, not just to calm ourselves down, but it's possible to come to meditation to come to gaze upon the suchness of ourselves, which I'd like to propose is beautiful. To be able to gaze upon the beauty of who we are, which is that which is most natural about being a human being. This rose, which is decaying, turning brown, is in the suchness of it all. I would say I can look upon it with a certain reverence and beauty as it ages and gets brown. Of course it will. Why does beauty only reside in the full, peak vitality of the rose?

One of the fascinating and important ways in which suchness can be seen is with a mind that is not caught up in unskillful states of mind, a mind that's not caught up in these comparisons that are driven by fear, ill will, greed, vanity, conceit, jealousy—a whole spectrum of ways in which we get caught in a mind that's tense and contracted and attached to something, that's selecting something out of the whole as being what's important, and some idea that it has to be a particular way.

The mind that can see suchness is the mind that is not caught in all these mental states of attachment. And that is a beautiful mind. That's a mind that's as beautiful as looking out across the ocean from the beach here in California and seeing the beauty of the ocean; looking at Half Dome in Yosemite; looking down into the Grand Canyon; looking up into the night sky and seeing the constellations and stars. There are times we look at the natural world and we're in awe and it's beautiful. But to look into our own mind, to look into our own being and be as marvelled with that as much as we would at the universe, the world outside... to be able to see our mind as being... they should probably make it a protected national monument. Maybe each of us should know that the next time the park service makes a national park, it should be the suchness of everyone's minds—the mind that is not caught up in these concepts and comparative thinking. It's a phenomenally beautiful thing, this mind, this heart.

And to see the world with that beautiful mind, that beautiful heart, allows us then to see the suchness of other people, their beauty as they are. We look at the rose that's decaying and it's a beautiful rose. Maybe we want to bow down to the rose, it's so beautiful. We have a reverence and care. The ability to see the beauty, see the suchness of things... I've been to the bedside of someone who had died, and it was profoundly beautiful in the suchness of it. Is it okay to say that? Probably I'd be careful to say that if the relatives are all quite upset and grieving. I might not say it then. But is there something about seeing everything in this life—except those things that are driven by hatred, driven by greed, driven by delusion or attachment—do they belong to the world of suchness?

In some ways they do. But they are born from an inability to appreciate the suchness of life. They are born from a mind that doesn't see the beauty of itself. They're born from hearts that are withered and contracted and in pain, and so they don't have the ability to touch into or be resting in or be grounded in this beautiful quality of our life. Everything is beautiful when it is free of greed, hatred, and delusion.

But a lot of it depends on how your mind is, the ability to see it. So if we're looking out and expecting to see the beauty and suchness and appreciate that in the world without somehow finding it in ourselves, it's probably not so stable or so accurate. So Buddhist meditation is a way of coming into ourselves to set ourselves free of our attachments, our clinging—not so that we are just detached, but so that we can appreciate and see the beautiful suchness of this world where there's no clinging, no grasping, no hatred. And then we can start being the suchness. There is an acting, a living in the world from the suchness, with the suchness. What's that like? It's a life which is free, free of attachment.

For me, this whole movement of mindfulness and meditation is such a phenomenally wonderful thing. We're doing something I almost have a deep reverence for, like I do for the night sky, looking into the amazement of it, or beautiful scenery in the natural world, or taking the time to walk in the garden and see the flowers, appreciate each flower for itself, or take time to see a hummingbird and its incandescent color and the flittering around. It's so beautiful. It takes time to stop and appreciate the suchness of our mind, the suchness of the world. And then we're available to live a wiser life. What a wonderful thing to live a life that comes out of that recognition of suchness, recognition of beauty that is so easily overlooked in ourselves and others in this world. And it's overlooked when our attention becomes excessively selective. It's only about how long the stem is, it's only about the full complement of petals, it's only about some aspect of it that we hold on to. "This is what it's about. This is who I have to be. This is what I'm about."

There are a few mentions in the ancient teachings of the Buddha of people who are just such, the suchness of themselves. One of them, which maybe is a little bit interpretive, is that the Buddha most frequently refers to himself not as the Buddha, not as his given name Gautama, but he refers to himself as the Tathāgata.³ It's an ancient title that probably preceded the Buddha. No one quite knows what it means, but it's a compound of two words, but they don't quite know which two words because of how the compound words' letters can merge. But my favorite interpretation of it is that it means "the one who is thus." The Buddha is the one who is thus, the one who is such. So imagine you go up to the Buddha and you're like, "He seems like an unusual guy." So you ask him, "Who are you? What are you about?" And you have your notebook out, you're going to write down notes because after all, you don't get to talk to a Buddha that often. And he says, "I am thus. I am such. I'm the suchness of this." Would you be irritated, or would you now appreciate, wow, rather than picking and choosing the parts and defining who he is in some particular way, he just is. He's not defining himself. He's just there, and what is apparent is there. He's not going to define it any more than the suchness of it.

Here's a few quotes. If you see the selective process that doesn't see the suchness as one that has an opinion about things, a story about things, a view of how things are, then maybe you'll appreciate this poem:

> One who is attached argues over doctrines.
> How and with what does one argue with someone unattached?
> Embracing nothing, rejecting nothing, right here,
> a person has shaken off all views.⁴

So there's a time, sitting in meditation, where it makes a lot of sense to embrace nothing and reject nothing if what we want to do is to see the fullness, the wholeness of the suchness of this moment.

Here's another verse:

> They aren't enemies to anything
> seen, heard, or thought out.
> How in this world could one have
> assumptions about those who see in this way,
> whose conduct is open?

So for people who are not opposed to anything that they see or hear or any opinions, if they don't have that, how could you make assumptions about them? How can you define them? Their conduct is open. I guess you get what you see with how they conduct themselves, how they are in their suchness.

And one more:

> One does not construct,
> prefer, or take up any doctrine.
> A sage is not led by precepts or religious practices,
> is someone who has gone beyond, who does not depend on beliefs.
> It is someone who is thus.

So, why did the Buddha hold up a flower, and why did the monk smile? Can you hold yourself up in such a way that you smile? In your thusness, your suchness? I certainly hope that you can gaze upon yourself in such a way, be present for yourself in such a way, with a mind that's quiet enough from its attachments, its fears, its desires, so that you can gaze upon this beautiful being that you are in its suchness. And then to look upon others, every other person, with reverence and care and respect, that you can come to see the suchness of them as they are.

And what a great world it would be if we loved and respected people just as they are, in a world where we don't see through the filter of greed, hatred, and delusion.

So thank you very much, my friends, my friends and flowers. We've been a bouquet here today, and the individual flowers are just as wonderful in the bouquet as they are apart. May you take your wonderfulness with you through the day. Thank you.

¹ **Mahākāśyapa:** One of the most revered of the Buddha's disciples, known for his ascetic practices. The story of the "Flower Sermon" is a foundational legend in Zen Buddhism, symbolizing the direct, non-verbal transmission of insight from teacher to student.

² **Kōan:** A paradoxical story, question, or statement used in Zen practice to provoke "great doubt" and test a student's progress.

³ **Tathāgata:** (Pali/Sanskrit: तथागत) The term the Buddha most often used when referring to himself. Its meaning is ambiguous, but is often interpreted as "one who has thus gone" (tathā-gata) or "one who has thus come" (tathā-āgata), implying one who has transcended the cycle of birth and death. The speaker's interpretation, "one who is thus" or "one who is such," points to the idea of embodying reality as it is, without conceptual overlays. The transcript had "tattagata," a likely phonetic mistranscription.

⁴ **Shaken off all views:** The original transcript said "shaken off all abuse." While possible, in the context of Buddhist texts discussing attachment to doctrines, the word "views" (Pali: *diṭṭhi*) is a more common and fitting concept. Attachment to views is considered a significant fetter to liberation.
