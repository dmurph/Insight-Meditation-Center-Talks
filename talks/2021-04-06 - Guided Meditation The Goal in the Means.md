So, finding a posture for meditation that's comfortable, that allows you to be at ease, but also to be alert. You can sit, you can stand, you can lie down, whatever works for you. And then, to gently close your eyes, or if you prefer, to leave them open with a soft, unfocused gaze.

Let's begin by taking a few deep, relaxing breaths. Breathing in a way that feels nourishing, and as you exhale, letting go of any tension you might be holding in your body or mind. Just allowing the breath to be a gentle anchor to the present moment.

And as you settle in, begin to bring your awareness to the body. Feeling the points of contact with the chair or the cushion, the floor. Feeling the gentle pull of gravity. And just allowing the body to be as it is, without any need to change or fix anything. Just being present with the sensations of the body.

And now, bringing your awareness to the breath itself. Noticing the gentle rise and fall of the abdomen or the chest with each inhalation and exhalation. Feeling the air as it enters your nostrils and as it leaves. Just resting your attention on the simple, natural rhythm of the breath. There's no need to control it or manipulate it in any way. Just allowing it to be your guide, your focus.

If you find your mind wandering, as it naturally will, just gently and kindly guide it back to the breath. Each time you notice the mind has strayed, that's a moment of mindfulness. A moment of waking up. So, without any judgment, just gently return your attention to the sensation of breathing.

In the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta[^1], the Buddha's discourse on the foundations of mindfulness, he gives the instruction to know the breath. When breathing in a long breath, one knows, "I am breathing in a long breath." When breathing out a long breath, one knows, "I am breathing out a long breath." Or when breathing in a short breath, one knows, "I am breathing in a short breath." Or when breathing out a short breath, one knows, "I am breathing out a short breath."

This isn't about controlling the breath, but about knowing it. It's a simple, direct awareness of what is already happening. The goal is not to achieve a certain state, but to be present with what is. The means is the goal. The practice of being with the breath, just as it is, is the practice of freedom.

So, for the next few minutes, just rest in this simple awareness. The awareness of the breath, the awareness of the body. If thoughts or feelings arise, just notice them as you would notice a cloud passing in the sky. Acknowledge their presence, and then gently return your attention to the breath.

There's a story of a monk who was practicing meditation, and he was getting very frustrated because his mind was so busy. He went to his teacher and said, "My mind is like a wild monkey, jumping from branch to branch. I can't seem to calm it down." The teacher said, "Don't try to stop the monkey. Just give it a banana to hold."

The breath is our banana. It's something to give the mind to hold onto, to give it a focus. It doesn't mean the monkey will stop jumping, but it gives it something to do. It gives it a place to rest.

So, as we continue to sit, just offering the mind this gentle anchor of the breath. Noticing the sensations, the rhythm, the quality of each breath. And in this simple act of awareness, we are cultivating a sense of presence, of calm, of being at home in our own experience.

And now, as we come to the end of this meditation period, just gently begin to broaden your awareness. Becoming aware of the sounds around you, the feeling of the air on your skin. And when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes, bringing this sense of presence and awareness with you into the rest of your day.

May you be well, happy, and peaceful. May you be free from suffering.
