So, I want to say some words for people who might be listening today on Audio Dharma, because maybe some of you are wondering what happened. It's not being broadcast on YouTube today because we're having trouble streaming from the computer. We'll work on it, and I'm sure we'll fix it.

An announcement is that it just felt right to me that for the next two weeks after tomorrow, we'll take a break from meeting in person here at IMC. This is to get our bearings a little bit with this new COVID situation. We'll probably start again in person in two weeks, on Monday the 17th, is my guess, but we'll see how things develop. I don't feel so worried myself, but maybe that's from stupidity. A little influence on this is that about two weeks ago, my son came home from college with Omicron. Going through that whole process of monitoring it and learning about it was partly the motivation to close for two weeks, but also part of the reason why I'm not so worried. The precautions we have here are pretty good, and I think that makes it pretty safe for everyone.

When we open again, we might request, or maybe require, that everyone also be boosted. The boosters make a big difference. My son went through it and almost wouldn't have known he had it, except he was told and then got tested. He had very minor symptoms. All of us quarantined and got tested at the right time, and so it's all good, apparently. So, that's the announcement.

Now, for the talk.

This is the last Sunday talk for this year, as we get ready to welcome in a new year. I remember that when we brought in 2020, because of the "20/20 vision" thing, some of us talked about it being the year of clear seeing. Well, maybe it was in some ways. But now I'm thinking about 2022, and I would love it if it was a year of care—a year in which we cared. It seems particularly important at this juncture of human history that more of us care. It really makes a difference if we all come together to care about so many things we've learned are worth caring about over the last year, over the last decades.

Then I woke up this morning to learn that Desmond Tutu[^1] had died. He was a very inspiring person, both because of his fight against apartheid but also because of his phenomenal work with the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa. That was so inspiring. It's one thing to set a people free from oppression, which is so important. It's another thing to come out of that and try to heal a society that was so divided. Probably South Africa wouldn't have managed so well if it hadn't been for the Truth and Reconciliation process. That inspired so many people in South Africa, even people who didn't go through it formally. The proceedings they had appointed a different way of being together.

Thinking about what I was going to talk about today, I read a little bit about his biography. I just wanted to mention that apparently, he had polio as a kid, and his right hand was atrophied because he couldn't use it. Also, when he was 18, he spent a year and a half in the hospital with tuberculosis. But there was an Episcopal priest who came to visit him and became his friend, and that's what set him in motion to become a priest himself, and then the archbishop, and then such a big influence on South Africa. He was a great, inspiring person, but we also remember that there were people who cared for the inspiring people—the people who believed in them enough so that they could move forward and become someone wonderful.

Perhaps this idea of emphasizing care... there's a traditional story from somewhere, I have this idea it's from the Middle East. Sometime in the time of old, there was a family that gave birth to a baby girl. As it was, there was an old, wise woman who lived on the edge of town, and she came to see this new girl that was born. She said, "Oh, she's a wonderful girl, for sure. And she will die on her wedding night."

Well, she grew up, and she was a wonderful person. She got engaged and married. There was the wedding, and then there was a wedding feast that evening. The parents didn't tell anybody about this prediction, but they were a little bit on edge, you know, "She's going to die tonight." It was a big feast; everyone was partying and feasting and dancing. There came a poor beggar to the door of the party, who knocked and asked to have some food. Everyone shooed the person away, "No, no, no." But the bride somehow saw what was going on, and of all the people in the party, she was the one who went out there to give food to the beggar.

The party went on, there was a wedding night, and everyone woke up the next morning, and they were alive. So the parents went to find the old woman and said, "What happened? We've been living with this idea that she was going to die." "Oh," she said, "but there was one thing that was going to save her, and that was if she did an act of kindness on her wedding night. But I couldn't have told you that, because then it wouldn't have worked. It wouldn't have been kind; it would have been done for that purpose."

So, the act of kindness that saves someone, the act of care that will save us. What will we save through our care?

There's lots to care about now, we know. They say that in terms of the whole climate change that's happening, it's not a matter of stopping it, but now our care can go into reducing the damage. In some ways, that makes it easier, because the idea of all or nothing is kind of hard. But the idea that we can reduce it, each of us can reduce it in an important way, maybe by saving one life, one animal life, anything we can do to make it better, to care.

But one of the things that we save if we care is, in fact, our care. Maybe caring, compassion, kindness is one of the most important resources that we have. And it can be lost. It can be forgotten. It can be submerged in despair, it can be lost in anger, it can be lost in all kinds of things and distractions, in Netflix. But to care, to let that be beautiful... maybe what's saved is our care, and that counts. Who knows what our care will be needed for?

There's another, maybe Middle Eastern or Near Eastern, story of a Sufi. Some genie comes along and offers this Sufi one wish—or two wishes, you'll decide whether it's one or two. The Sufi wishes, "May I help everyone I come across. Wherever I go, may I be helpful to people. But may it be that I don't know that I'm doing it." And so he's given this big burlap bag to carry that's filled with seeds of fruit trees, maybe date palms or something. It has a little hole in the back of it, and so as he's carrying it on his back, it slowly loses these seeds out the back, but he doesn't see them falling. He keeps walking as he wanders around his part of the world, and he doesn't see that over the weeks and months and years, after him grows these fruit trees that benefit the people around him. So who knows? Does your care need to have proof that you've succeeded? Is it enough to care? Can you care?

But sometimes we do get the wonderful fruits of our care, and sometimes it comes back to ourselves. Maybe this is a very trite example, but it was a little bit inspiring, maybe because it happened during a retreat at the retreat center, and so everything kind of magnified a little bit there. For those of you who haven't been there, we have a little coffee and tea area, and under the counter, there's a small little refrigerator where they have different kinds of milk. One day I noticed that there was no milk there. So I went out of my way to go get milk, an unopened container, and I put it in the fridge for someone who was going to come. I didn't think about it anymore. A couple of hours later, I decided to have some tea and to put some milk in it, and I opened the refrigerator, and there was a full, unopened bottle of milk there. The person who had benefited was me.

You know, I cared. It's a silly example, right? But it comes around. I'll tell you another way it comes around that happened this week or so. My mother is now in a memory care home and is now in hospice. A week or two ago, as all this hospice care comes into play, I received a call. I get all these phone calls now from the hospice about all kinds of issues and stuff, from this wonderful, wonderful place, Mission Hospice here in San Mateo. I got one of these phone calls, and this woman says, "I'm the Mission Hospice chaplain, and I'm getting ready to visit your mom." It turns out the woman who's my mom's chaplain was introduced to chaplaincy by doing the Buddhist chaplaincy training that I offer here at IMC some 10 or 11 years ago. She went through the training and learned about all this. I was supporting her; it's a wonderful thing to train chaplains. Some of you in the room have been in the chaplaincy program, I can see at least three or four of you here. I just love doing it. I feel like it's a kind of pyramid scheme for joy because people go out and benefit others, and then guess who benefited? It comes around. So that's nice. Who knows what our care does in the world? Maybe we don't need to know, but who knows the good we can do.

There's another story of a Christian monastery someplace where the few monks that were left were getting quite old. No one came to visit the monastery anymore, and no one was joining. It seemed like the monastery was just dying away. They could see that in a few years, none of the monks would be left, and what would happen to the monastery? It had been a thriving monastery in their youth, but now it was fading away. The abbot was a little concerned about this, of course, and was quite perplexed. He said, "I'm going to go visit this very wise rabbi in the next valley over."

So the abbot went to the rabbi and said, "You know, we have this issue in our monastery. It's dying away, no one's coming. It seems like it's coming to its end. Can you give any ideas of what we can do, what might revive it?" They had tea and talked about things, and the rabbi said, "No, not really. I don't know about monasteries." But then, as the abbot was leaving to go back home, the rabbi said, "Oh, by the way, one of your monks back at your monastery is going to be the next messiah."

The abbot went back to the monastery, and the monks that were there were eager to find out what he had learned. They all wanted to know the advice. The abbot said, "Well, he had no advice for us. He didn't have anything to say. But he did say the strangest thing as I was leaving. He said one of us is going to be the messiah." And they said, "Wow, that's strange."

But then in the next days and weeks, the monks were like, "Well, who could it be? It can't be Father Lawrence, he's always so grumpy. However, he's always helping. He's always at the right place when someone needs help. Could it be him? No, no, maybe. But what about Brother Joseph? He's just so lazy. No one does less than him in the monastery. But whenever he does something, he's always so kind." They went through everyone like that, "Could it be that person?" As they had these thoughts and recognized that each of them had something a little good going for them, they started treating each other with respect and care and reverence in a way that they maybe hadn't done for a long time.

Then one day, some young people from town came to have a picnic on the monastery grounds, and they felt something. They had little conversations with some of the monks and they felt something special. So they came back, and more of them came. Then some of them joined the monastery and became monks. After a couple of years, the place was thriving again with young, dedicated monastics.

So, what happens when we care for each other, we respect each other, we revere each other? What are the conditions we put in place? It doesn't take a lot of thinking to see that those are very different conditions than being mean or being indifferent. To care, to love, to be kind, as if your care is important, as if you matter, that what you do matters. And maybe it doesn't have to be big. You don't have to become a Desmond Tutu. But maybe it's that you cared about a neighbor, you cared about someone who has a flat tire and you pull over to help them. I remember once in Palo Alto, a woman's car was stalled in an intersection. She was standing there wondering what to do, and it seemed dangerous. So I got out of my car, parked it, and pushed her car to the side. It seemed like a nice thing to do, the right thing to do. I haven't thought about it in 30 years, but there it is now.

So to care. Who knows who we're meeting? Do you know the people you meet? Do you know who they are and what their destiny is? Do you know anybody, really? Who knows? Maybe they're like Father Lawrence, maybe they're the messiah, maybe there's something special there.

In 2013, some people cared for a 13-year-old girl who was shot. Two years later, that girl, Malala Yousafzai[^2], received the Nobel Peace Prize. Who would have known that caring for her would have such a big impact?

In 2018, a 15-year-old teenager, Greta Thunberg[^3], started skipping school. A year later, Forbes magazine listed her as one of the 100 most powerful women in the world, and she ended up as Time magazine's Person of the Year. Who would have known?

In 2020, a 17-year-old teenager working at the local mall, Darnella Frazier[^4], changed America by taking the video of George Floyd dying.

And before that, there was a girl who went to 13 different schools before she graduated high school. She went on to be a single parent, cared for by friends and living on food stamps. What would happen to her? She is now currently the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland[^5], from the Laguna Pueblo tribe.

Who knows who's out there? Who knows who we meet? Who knows who you are? Some of these people are ordinary people, but who knows what comes their way?

All these things are maybe inspiring, but also a little daunting when you mention such great people who do such monumental things. But each of them needed people who cared for them. And the people who care, I think, don't have to know what the impact of their care is. Maybe what's important about care is the caring itself, without much thought about long-term impacts. Just to take care, to live a life of care.

How would you live if you lived as if your life mattered? How would you live if you really thought that you could make a difference? I think our lives do matter.

Probably many of you know the stereotypic idea now that during the holidays, some people watch *It's a Wonderful Life*. Maybe we can all be George Bailey, the man who didn't think he'd done anything good in life and was going to jump off a bridge and commit suicide. Then the angel comes and shows him what the town would have been like if he hadn't lived at all. And it was awful. So here we are. We do matter, each of us.

We ended up with Kuan Yin[^6] on the altar. It's kind of nice to have her there, especially for this talk on care, compassion, and kindness. There's a story about Kuan Yin, who is sometimes said to have 11 heads and a thousand arms. The story is that she worked tirelessly to save people. Apparently, one day she had everything all tidied up. Imagine that, everyone was good. Then she woke up the next morning, and sure enough, people were suffering again. It didn't take long for the suffering to come back. She did it again, but the suffering came, and she saw the immense suffering of this world that seemingly she couldn't keep up with. So, I guess in English we would say she was heartbroken, but her head burst into 11 heads and a thousand arms, so she could be even more effective and helpful. The thousand arms are there because each hand has a different tool or implement to help the world. She has all these heads to look everywhere.

I like this story a little bit because some of us are afraid of having our heart broken. If it's difficult to have your heart broken, maybe you haven't had it broken enough. Maybe there's the art of letting it really break. Maybe then you'll be Kuan Yin; your heart will break into 11 hearts. Or as some people say, if your heart breaks into many pieces, it just has more surface area in order to feel and sense and be caring for this world. I don't think we should be so afraid of having our hearts broken. If we can learn, maybe through the mindfulness practice we do, to not resist it, not be oppressed by it, not be afraid of it, not be submerged by it, and not give up because of it... there's something about caring in spite of the broken heart. Something about a sense of dignity and value and presence that allows the heart to break and something to emerge from that: caring for the world, caring for others, sensitivity, love, kindness. Maybe if your heart is broken enough, what else is there but to be kind? What's left if you do it thoroughly?

So these thousand arms, I think of them also as hands that reach out and touch the whole world. It's remarkable that we live in a world now that has gotten so small. It's a bit of a cliché, but I can't help but keep thinking that it's getting smaller and smaller. The way that what happens elsewhere in the world affects us is incredible. Less than two months ago, someone got sick with COVID in South Africa, and it was discovered to be this new variant. When did I ever care so much about a sick person on the other side of the world? But that one person, from where it began, spread out across the whole world, and now the whole world is pausing in a certain way because of Omicron. We have this invisible force we don't see with our normal eyes, the virus, and the fact that it spreads and connects all of us, all over the world. What happens in South Africa, what happens elsewhere, has a huge impact on us. Can we just close our borders and care for ourselves, as if that's enough? If we want to care for ourselves, I think we should care for others.

It isn't just our mothers going to nursing homes and having chaplains we trained come to care for them that we can experience how it comes back to us. It's also that if we don't care for the world, don't care for others, then what virus will come find us?

I kind of love seeing people with masks on. I'm troubled by it, of course, but my assumption is that when people wear masks, they're caring for me. And certainly, when I'm wearing a mask, I'm caring for all of you. The fact that we're in a room full of people where the care is visible, I think it's such a beautiful thing, a wonderful thing. Love made visible, these masks.

The wonderful thing about COVID—can we say the "wonderful" around it?—is that it's this simultaneous thing where if we care for others, we're simultaneously caring for ourselves. It's represented by the masks. The mask is a way of caring for ourselves; you're protecting yourself with the mask, and you're protecting others through the mask. It's a situation where you get the benefits of both. You get to benefit yourself and care for others. So you might as well get credit for both. Don't just do it for your own sake, and don't just do it for other people's sake. Do it for both. You get a lot more credit, wherever credit is stored. I think it's in your heart. That's where the credit is. It's a beautiful thing to develop, to grow this heart, to expand this heart, sometimes by breaking it and letting it grow. It makes a difference. Your care makes a difference for you, and it makes a difference for the world.

So perhaps, just like in the monastery, if we treat everyone as worthy of care, worthy of respect, worthy of reverence—everyone—it is a care that I think will return and benefit us as well. Not least because it's good for our hearts, it's good for our inner lives to treat people that way, to see people that way. I think of it as the natural way of being. Anything short of that requires resistance, requires contraction, closing down, pushing away, being selfish.

So, the year of care.

I was thinking that some people have calculated that unless we change something, a million species of plants and animals will be extinct within the next hundred years. So what will die if we don't care? Certainly, care will die. And do you want to live in a world where there's no care? I'd rather live in a world that cares than anything else.

And with our care, some things will die. One of the things that will die is our selfishness. Would that be so bad? I think it'll be liberating to do that.

So, 2022. May it be the year of care. And then by the end of next year, you'll know whether it was a year of care. If you cared, you'll be the proof of it.

May you benefit this world, and in doing so, yourself. Thank you.
