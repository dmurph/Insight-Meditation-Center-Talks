So, good to be with you all again. Welcome to those who are on YouTube joining us as well from afar.

Today I brought a story. Those of us who like to read the ancient Pali Canon suttas[^1] are familiar with the names and locations that often show up. If you're like me, I get curious, you know, who are these people? Where did they live? What were their lives like? And how did they practice? So today, I'd like to share a story of this person whose name is Anathapindika.[^2]

Some of you may know this story. I brought it in based on a compilation that Helmuth Hecker[^3] did, collecting various pieces of information from suttas, commentaries, and Jataka tales, and kind of put it together to give us a little picture of what this person's life was like. Usually, when you read suttas, you have a little glimpse of what this person is, but you don't get quite a story. So I'm grateful that Hecker had brought this together.

Often in the suttas, the opening line sounds like this: "Thus have I heard. One time the Blessed One, the Buddha, was staying at Savatthi[^4] in Jeta's[^5] Grove, in Anathapindika's monastery." And that shows up a lot in the suttas. So who is this guy, Anathapindika?

Anathapindika was a wealthy merchant, born into a very wealthy family. We don't know exactly what his profession was, but sometimes it's said a wealthy merchant or a wealthy banker. He lived in Savatthi, the place that the opening line often states. This person is known for his boundless generosity. The name Anathapindika actually means "one who gives to the poor" or "one who gives to those who are unprotected." That was not his birth name; his birth name is Sudatta.[^6] But even before he met the Buddha, before he was a Buddhist disciple, he was already known as Anathapindika. People had forgotten his birth name and they just called him Anathapindika.

I wanted to start by telling the story of how he encountered the Buddha. This is the first year after the Buddha's awakening. The Buddha had a very small monastic order, maybe just a handful of people who joined him and practiced and became awakened individuals as well. They didn't have a place to live. This is around a place called Rajagaha.[^7] Often, this monastic order would live in the nearby forest. They would stay on the mountaintops, or by the river, or in the open fields. That's kind of how they wandered about.

Anathapindika had a brother-in-law who lived in Rajagaha and was from that household. He was also quite wealthy, and being close by to the Buddha, he also became a faithful disciple. He saw how the monastics lived, and so he went and asked the Buddha, "Is it okay if I build some dwelling places for your order right around Rajagaha?" The Buddha said yes. He recognized the challenging living conditions, and when the offer arose, he agreed it would be nice to have a more permanent space to stay. So this brother-in-law began to build a monastery and dwelling places for the monastic order.

One day, Anathapindika, as a businessman who traveled to Rajagaha, came to see his brother-in-law. Apparently, they had a really cordial relationship; they were very warm and caring for each other. But when Anathapindika showed up at his door, his brother-in-law was so busy making preparations for some big, elaborate event that he almost didn't pay attention to Anathapindika, which was very unlike him. So he said, "What are you so busy doing here? Are you preparing for a wedding, or are you going to see a king? What are you busy doing?"

The brother-in-law said, "I'm inviting the enlightened one, the Buddha, and his order to come for the alms round tomorrow." Anathapindika had the thought, "What? The enlightened one, the Buddha, coming to your door tomorrow just for alms?" It's not like it happened every other week, right? In that culture, they knew this notion of an enlightened being, the Buddha, but for one to just show up next door at his brother-in-law's house—that was unheard of. That's not common back then, and that's not common right now. So imagine somebody telling you they're going to offer alms to an enlightened individual tomorrow. You'd be like, "What?" He asked him three times, "The *really* enlightened one?" And the brother-in-law said, "Yes, the Buddha is coming tomorrow morning."

That got Anathapindika's attention. That night, he couldn't sleep. He was tossing back and forth. This idea that he was going to see an enlightened individual was so intriguing. At some point, he decided, "Okay, I'm not going to sleep." He got up in the middle of the night and decided that he was going to walk out of the city and walk towards where the monastic order stayed, in the countryside. It was dark. I imagine, being born into a wealthy family with a lot of support, he probably never had to walk out of the city in the dark, in the countryside, all by himself. So he got scared walking, but this idea of seeing the Buddha was so strong. Somehow he managed to calm his mind. He said, "I'm going to go anyhow." So he kept on walking.

At some point, in the midst of the dawn, he saw a person walking back and forth. He stopped. And then he heard this person calling in an indescribably harmonious voice, "Come, Sudatta." No one knew him by the name of Sudatta at that time. He thought, "That must be the Buddha. Who else would know?" So he bowed down immediately at the Buddha's feet and, with a shaky voice, asked, "How are you, the Buddha?" That was a conventional greeting, "How are you?" And the Buddha answered in a very unconventional way. He said, "Well, the arahants,[^8] the awakened individuals, are always well. They are beyond the possibilities for suffering." You can just feel Anathapindika's jaw drop. Beyond the possibility of suffering? Is that even possible?

And so the Buddha, in that first encounter, offered a step-by-step teaching. It went from generosity, which he was already very steeped in, to Sila,[^9] which is ethical behavior. I imagine he was very ethical in his behavior already. Then the Buddha taught about the heavens, the perilous and harmful nature of sensual pursuits, and the benefits of renunciation. This is known as the gradual training of the Buddha. At some point, the Buddha sensed that Anathapindika's heart and mind were ready, quite receptive, and open. He offered him the liberative teachings of the Four Noble Truths.[^10]

Upon receiving this teaching, the Dharma eye opened for Anathapindika. He knew the truth of what the Buddha said right there. He received it and he felt it in his being. He had no doubt anymore that this is the way. It is said that he entered the stream that would take him onward towards awakening in future times. You can imagine this touched him quite deeply.

At the end of that encounter, he invited the Buddha and his monastic order for alms food, after his brother-in-law had done so. And then at the end of that meal offering, Anathapindika went up and asked the Buddha if he could build a monastery in his hometown, Savatthi. The Buddha said, "The enlightened ones love peaceful places." He took that as a yes. He was so happy. That was the conception of Anathapindika's monastery in Savatthi.

Once he went back to his hometown, he immediately began to search up and down for this peaceful place where the monastics might be able to stay. He found a place that belonged to Prince Jeta, called Jeta's Grove. He was the son of King Pasenadi.[^11] So he asked Prince Jeta if the place was for sale. Jeta said, "Nope, this place is not for sale." He said so firmly, "Even if you're giving me 18 million dollars, this is not for sale." Eighteen million sounds like a lot, right? But he's a businessman, so Anathapindika was not budging on this. He said, "I'm going to give you 18 million dollars right now."

But Prince Jeta also didn't budge and said, "No, this place is not for sale." But Anathapindika didn't give up. Eventually, the two of them went to an arbitrator who managed to get them to agree on something. What was agreed upon was that Anathapindika would get the land that could be covered by the coins. If you lay the coins one by one on the land, that would be the space you get. So Anathapindika pulled out carts and carts of coins and started to lay them on the ground. It just so happened that there was only a little corner that wasn't covered. But in this whole process, Prince Jeta got so inspired by this being. "Wow, this is unheard of." So he came and he said, "Well, okay, even though there are not enough coins to cover this corner, I'm going to build the gateway for this monastery for free." Apparently, Jeta spent the 18 million dollars to build this gateway and offered it as part of the monastery.

That's how the monastery got built. After that, Anathapindika also spent a lot more to furnish it, put up buildings, and put on a huge celebratory event, inviting all the monastics and everyone to come and take joy in this. Even after all of this, he continued to support the monastic order and the broader community he was in. In this way, he is known to be the foremost in his generosity, as one of the great disciples of the Buddha.

I also wanted to mention that this monastery, Anathapindika's Monastery, is a place that the Buddha spent a lot of his time in. Out of the 40 or 45 or so years of his teaching career, he spent about 19 to 25 of the rainy season retreats in Anathapindika's park. A lot of teachings flowed out of this place, out of the generosity of this being. I feel this deep gratitude for this.

I want to say a little bit about Anathapindika's relational world. He had a family. He was happily married, and his wife was also a devoted disciple of the Buddha. She was very kind to the big household as well as all the people who worked in the family business. He had four children: three daughters and one son. Two daughters were steeped in the Dharma and also happily married. The youngest daughter was very sharp and wise and also had a deep understanding of the Dharma, but she struggled. She saw that her two sisters got married happily, but for whatever reason, she couldn't get married. She got really sad and lonely and depressed, and eventually starved to death. It was very touching to hear the stories of how Anathapindika's family had to deal with a loss like this, just like many of us, with all kinds of ups and downs, even with the immense and wealthy conditions he lived in.

He had a son with whom he had some ups and downs. For a long while, his son didn't want to have anything to do with the Dharma. He was a busy businessman, I guess he inherited the big business of the family, and he was always busy. It took a while for Anathapindika. The story was that at some point, he had to bribe his son with a thousand dollars for him to come for an Uposatha day,[^12] which is a practice day. I thought, "Wow, poor parents." That's kind of what we do sometimes. There was a little happy ending in that somehow the bribe worked. The father promised a thousand dollars. The first time it worked because he was so busy, and just having an Uposatha day meant he actually stopped working for a day, which was good. He finally took a break. The second time, he bribed him with another thousand dollars to come with him to spend an afternoon at the monastery. That's where he met the Buddha. He received the teaching and connected with it. So over time, he also became a devoted Buddhist disciple, and he's known as the "little Anathapindika."

It wasn't so straightforward for Anathapindika. You can imagine the many years that his son just had no connection and was so busy with his business. I imagine Anathapindika at times might have been pretty frustrated, thinking, "Oh, you won't listen to me."

Anathapindika's broader social circle consisted of a lot of different kinds of individuals. As a businessman, he had people who were like-minded, but he also had a lot of people who drank. It was said that Anathapindika never diminished them or tried to fix them. He just modeled what he could and maintained the friendship with them. He never forced his way onto these individuals. I was very touched by this, that Anathapindika wasn't just generous in a materialistic way, but he also had a generous heart. He wasn't trying to go around and fix everybody. He let people be, and at the same time, he was doing the best that he could to model what could be modeled.

There is also this story about a friend he had from a very young age. This friend had a very unfortunate name, "Unlucky Bird." I suspect that this may be from a different, lower caste, given the Indian history of the caste system that was very prominent back then. When this friend needed money, he helped him out and even offered him a job that took care of his family. His friends were all criticizing him, like, "Oh, you know, this is very unfortunate and very inauspicious." But he wasn't concerned about it. One time, apparently, he was on a business trip, and a lot of thieves who heard that he was out schemed a robbery. This vigilant "Unlucky Bird" heard about this, and he started drumming in the middle of the night when the robbers were all circling in on the house. The big, loud drum sounds scared everybody away. When he came back and heard about this, he said, "Oh, look, you tell me this is unlucky. I'm very fortunate that he's helping us out in this way." He had this heart that was wide open, receiving all of these different forms of beings around him.

In terms of his relationship with the Buddha, after the monastery was built, the Buddha came to Savatthi very often. It's said that as a great disciple, Anathapindika would often visit the Buddha twice a day. Interestingly, he would just sit right by one side of the Buddha and usually did not ask the Buddha questions because he didn't want to create the impression that he got special treatment because he contributed so much to the community. He was a really humble being. He would come to see the Buddha, sit by one side, and wait to see if the Buddha would say something, either give a Dharma talk or ask him a question, and then he would respond. If the Buddha also didn't say anything, then he would say something about a situation he was in or something he had done, and then he would wait to see how the Buddha responded. He used that as a way of engaging with the teachings.

During the times when Anathapindika and the Buddha spent time together, apparently the Buddha had given a wide range of teachings, ranging from how to behave in very mundane situations all the way to liberative teachings. In this way, the teachings are flowing down towards all of us as well.

Maybe the most profound teaching that Anathapindika received was on his deathbed. There is a sutta in the Majjhima Nikaya,[^13] number 143, that spoke about the time when he was really sick. He was probably very old also, and it just wasn't getting any better. There's this horrific description of how much pain he had to endure, unbearable pain, like carts pulling the limbs all apart or something. He was not getting any better. So he asked for Ananda[^14] and Sariputta[^15] to come and see him, to help him out. Ananda and Sariputta are two of the great disciples of the Buddha. Sariputta was an arahant, and Ananda at that time was not quite yet. They came to see Anathapindika and knew that this man was not getting any better, that he was near his death.

So Sariputta offered a whole set of profound instructions that were probably very appropriate for what Anathapindika was experiencing. This set of instructions invited Anathapindika to not cling to the six senses: the eye, ear, smell, tongue, taste, body, touch, sensations, and the mind. He went through this instruction one by one, through each of the senses. Then he also went through the five aggregates. He said not to cling to each of these, and not to cling to the four elements—earth, water, fire, and air—that made up our bodies, and not to depend on them. And not just that, he went through all the immaterial realms and said not to cling to any of those either. He ended by saying not to cling to this world or the other world or anything in between, and not to depend on any of those.

I have a sense, reading the sutta, that Anathapindika was already ready for this. He knew he was dying, and having any form of clinging to this fading body made no sense. As Sariputta was offering this, I have a sense that he was offering almost a guided meditation. He went through each of the senses, repeating this phrase, "not clinging to the eye, to the ear," and all the way to "anything in this world." Anathapindika was ready. In this guided meditation, he probably rode along with Sariputta. He felt the truth of that.

So at the end, Anathapindika burst into tears. Ananda didn't quite know what happened and said, "Householder, are you failing?" Anathapindika responded, "No, venerable Ananda, I wasn't failing. It's just that for a long time I've paid homage to the Buddha and the esteemed mendicants,[^16] yet I have never before heard such a Dharma talk."

He had been around the Buddha a lot, but he had never heard this. Ananda explained, "Well, these instructions usually weren't given to the laypeople." Anathapindika asked Sariputta and Ananda, "Please let those teachings be offered to the lay practitioners as well, because there are people with little dust in their eyes. There will be those who can understand this." For this, I am forever grateful for what he did, as teachings were not kept only for the monastics anymore. They were offered to those who were ready, lay or monastic.

I remember at one time when I heard this sutta, I said, "I'd like someone to read this to me on my deathbed." And I went ahead and recorded this sutta for myself. I read it and recorded it. If somebody is not reading it, I'm going to listen to my own recording.

So, holding that possibility for each of us. There were great beings like Anathapindika 2,500 or 2,600 years ago, and there are great beings now, and there are great beings that come to be through the practice. So may the story of Anathapindika be an inspiration for all of us.

Thank you for your kind attention.

I have a few minutes if there are any reflections, sharing, or comments.

(Question from audience): Thank you for the really beautiful Dharma talk. What was the name of the sutta that was said to him?

(Speaker): I'll have to look it up. I think it might be the Anathapindikovada Sutta, but I can't remember for sure now. I'll give you the number, it's 143 of the Majjhima Nikaya, the Middle Length Discourses. There are 152 suttas in the Middle Length Discourses, so it's towards the end.

(Comment from audience): I especially appreciate you talking about Anathapindika's family. That really put it in a broader context for me.

(Speaker): That's right. Knowing that people back then had families and went through all kinds of ups and downs just like us, for me, kind of brings what was being taught alive. It's true that they may be living in a very different way than how we live, but there's also a lot in common. And it was so special for this layperson to receive the teachings in this way.

(Speaker): Well, maybe that's enough then. I'll be around if there are questions and comments you'd like to come up and chat. I welcome that. Thank you, everyone.
