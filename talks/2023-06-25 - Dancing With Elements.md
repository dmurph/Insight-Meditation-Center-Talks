Wow, just hearing the announcement, you feel the vibrancy of the community. Welcome, welcome, joining us together here physically in IMC and also on YouTube. So knowing that we have a broader Sangha all around. And I also mentioned that the potluck welcomes everyone, because it's us getting together to celebrate this significant occasion. And so you are welcome to stay around and join us afterwards.

Today, the topic I brought with me is the Buddhist teachings on the four Great elements, or five, and sometimes there's six, so I'm just going to say elements. This, in some way, wasn't planned, but it just happened to follow on Kim Allen's 7 a.m. meditation this last week on the elements as well. For those who didn't get the chance to participate, I'll just offer a little background on this teaching. The four, five, or six elements are often known as Earth, Water, Fire, and Air. Sometimes the fifth is Space, and sometimes the sixth is Consciousness. Today, we're mostly in the four and five territory. The fire element is sometimes translated as the heat element, and the air element is sometimes translated as the wind element, so you may hear those interchangeably. These are the basic elements that make up the world we live in, the planet we're living on, the Earth underneath us, as well as this body. This body is made of this set of elements.

Different spiritual and religious traditions often relate to the set of elements in quite significant ways. You probably know this. The indigenous people are often called the stewards of the Earth; they protect the Earth, the land, like protecting our own bodies, our own lives. And so 2,600 years ago, in the Buddhist times, people also knew about these elements, and there was some significance in the culture as well.

I wanted to share some teachings specifically from the Buddha about the elements, and I'd like to start with a teaching that the Buddha offered to his son, Rāhula.[^1] For those who are interested in studying suttas,[^2] this story is documented in Majjhima Nikāya number 62, the Mahā-Rāhulovāda Sutta. This teaching was offered to Rāhula when he was a young adult, maybe in his late teens or early 20s.

One day, the Buddha got up in the morning, ready to go for his alms round. When he got up, Rāhula got up as well and followed the Buddha. Here they are, the Buddha in the front, Rāhula in the back following him. This is when Rāhula has been in the monastic community for more than a decade now; it was said that he was ordained as a young boy, a seven-year-old boy, when his father brought him into the monastic community.

So here they are, the Buddha walking in front, the leader of the community, the enlightened, the awakened being, and Rāhula, the young, maybe handsome young man, following the Buddha. I get a sense that there may be a certain attitude in Rāhula walking behind the Buddha. The Buddha had a little sense that maybe Rāhula had something going on, so the Buddha looked back and said to Rāhula, "Rāhula, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present, internal or external, coarse or fine, inferior or superior, far or near—all form with wise understanding as: 'This is not mine, I am not this, this is not myself.'"

I want to just pause and say a few words. The "form" here refers to the material aspects of our beings, our material body, the bones, the flesh, the physicality of our bodies. So the Buddha said you should see all this not from the perspective of "I, me, mine." I get the sense that Rāhula might have heard these teachings before. He asked, "Only form?" The Buddha went on to tell Rāhula that you also shouldn't take your feelings, or your perceptions, your mental fabrications, or even consciousness to be "I, me, mine." This is known as the teaching on the five clinging aggregates and not-self, which I will not go into today.

The Buddha may have had the sense that Rāhula was caught up a little bit by who he was and how he was related to the Buddha. We don't really know, but the Buddha might have sensed something going on. What happened next is that Rāhula decided, "I am not going to go to the village for alms." He thought, "Who would go to the village for alms today after being advised directly by the Buddha?" So human! You know, you're a teenager, you get advised by your parents, what are you going to do? You're not going to follow them around. Nope, no way. So he turned back, sat down, and started meditating instead of going for food. A small protest.

Right then and there, the great disciple of the Buddha, Sāriputta,[^3] saw Rāhula and he told Rāhula that he should practice mindfulness of breathing, as this practice offers a lot of benefit. Later in the evening, Rāhula came out from his meditation and went to see the Buddha. I guess he had a question to ask, and he knew the Buddha would have the answer for him. So he wasn't holding the grudge so much. He got up and went to see the Buddha and asked, "How is it that when you practice mindfulness of breathing, there will be a lot of benefit?"

But the interesting thing is the Buddha didn't answer this question right away. Instead, the Buddha offered him instructions on how to practice with the elements first. The Buddha pointed out that in this body, there are Earth elements. We can feel the Earth elements that are solid, hard—our bones, our teeth, our hair. This is the Earth element right here in our bodies. And there's the water element. You can feel the moisture or the oil on the hands, the fluid in the body. As I talk, I feel the saliva in my mouth. This is the water element. And there is the Air element, as we breathe in and out, the movements. And there's the fire element.

The Buddha offered the teaching in quite a lot of detail, with all the examples of what this is in your experience in the body, in its elemental nature. And the Buddha ended each of the instructions with a statement: "Earth element is just Earth element. The water element is just a water element. The fire element is just fire element. Air element is just air element. A space element is just a space element."

So what is the Buddha pointing to with this teaching? In our meditation, we briefly offered this, kind of really feeling and sensing into our experience in this elemental way. The Buddha is teasing apart the concept of "the body" into all these elemental aspects of our being, which we can experience directly, here and now.

Also, the reason that the Buddha offered this teaching is that the Buddha knows our mind very well and knows how our mind works. So often when we experience something that is quite immediate, raw, elemental, our mind will immediately follow along with a different kind of reality, a virtual reality. We may have a little moment where we feel some dryness on the skin. It's just the water element, just the dryness; the Earth element, just Earth element; the water element, just water element. But we don't stop there. You know what happens right away? "Oh, I really should drink more water. I haven't been drinking so much water as I'm aging, that's not good for me. And I have been using this moisturizer for a while, it probably hasn't been working. Maybe it's time to search around and see a better brand. There's a lot more, you know, new ingredients and new technologies that are working." And next thing you know, we're in Amazon-land.

That's how our mind works. We slip off from this raw, direct experience and we lump it into the stories of our experience, about our experiences. Sometimes it's not even about our experience anymore, but about something totally different that may be filled with desires, identifications, and aversions.

That's the thing that Buddha already knew very well, how our mind works. And often, what I'm describing in this particular example is quite a mild and benign version. Sometimes I can see that in my own mind, the stories can be much more dramatic, much more exciting or disappointing. And what's more is that often there can be a kind of a storyline underneath it: "I'm never good enough. I should be somebody else. I should be something other than who I am." There can be this kind of storyline running through this.

By offering this instruction to practice with the elements, the Buddha is offering us an opportunity to live more in line with the reality of our lived experience, rather than in the virtual realities that we're constructing in our mind and heart. The Earth element is just Earth element, not more complicated than that. Maybe that's what the young Rāhula needed before he got to the instructions on mindfulness of breathing. Maybe he got caught up a little bit by who he was and how he looked and his identities. So he needed some instruction to kind of drop those beliefs and ideas in the head and then drop more directly into the embodied experience.

The Buddha also offered this in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta,[^4] which is one of the seminal texts in the Pāli Canon that spoke about how practitioners should practice in order to become free from suffering. Many of the Theravāda[^5] meditative practices are taught based on this text, the Satipaṭṭhāna, as one of the mindfulness of the body instructions is the practice of the elements.

So it's not just Rāhula; we all may get caught by the stories of our experience. It's common that when our mind and heart are not trained, we tend to go into our stories and beliefs. So when we are in touch with the realities of our bodies at the elemental level, we can begin to see our experience just as it is.

Some years ago, I had an experience working with this particular practice. It was a period at the time that I was practicing the elemental practice and some associated practices rather continuously for a few weeks. One day, I was dropping my son off at his swim practice, and right around the swimming pool, I saw all those little kids running around. All of a sudden, thoughts came to my mind: "This little girl is so cute, this one is a little clumsy." And just, you know, all of a sudden I thought, "Wow, this thought is here." And maybe just because there was some continuity of the practice, all of a sudden what I saw was all the kids turned into skeletons, little skeletons running around the swimming pool.

Immediately, I noticed a contrast in my mind. All those little preferences, likes, and dislikes faded away. That moment was a powerful moment. I just realized, "Wow, this practice has a function." It has a potent function. It can kind of pull us out of the stories, the likes and dislikes, and the habit mind, and highlight for us their presence and their absence. It was a really powerful moment for me, recognizing, "Wow, this practice really has some strong potency for us." I was also quite humbled by it.

The other thing I wanted to say is when this highlight becomes available, what also becomes available is a sense of choice. That's the moment that we can choose. We can choose to follow the storyline, which probably usually won't go that well, or we could choose to drop into our immediate experience. And so that's another form of empowerment that this practice can offer. When we pause, when we see things directly in the raw, elemental way, we also begin to have choices. We can make wise choices.

It may seem quite innocent sometimes that we have these kinds of thoughts, and some may even seem harmless. After all, they're just a few fleeting thoughts in the mind. Yet when we reflect deeper, our ideas, our beliefs about good and bad, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly—when those harden into beliefs, they become such dividing forces in our societies. This practice offers something to take us out of that divide that can really separate ourselves from others. By practicing with this, it has a direct impact on our own well-being and also the well-being of the world at large.

I also want to say that this example doesn't mean that we should flatten life by only seeing elements. After all, there is richness in life. In fact, I would like to say that by practicing with elements, there is much life, aliveness, and richness that can come forth through experiencing the ever-changing dynamic of the elements. There is a dance of the elements right here in our being. Can you imagine if we don't have the Earth element in the body? We'd be all floating around. Or without the air element, we couldn't even live. The air element animates us. That's how we can move, we can walk, we can run, even just lift our hand—that's the Air element in the body. The water element is cohesiveness; it brings all of those elements together. Like the water sprinkled on flour to knead the dough,[^6] it kind of brings it together into something so that we can actually sit here with a sitting posture. That's the water element holding us together, otherwise we'd just be dust and sand here.

There is all this dance, and the elements are working through us, bringing aliveness and richness into our being. Through this practice, we can really get in deep touch with this. This is also to see that when we're experiencing in this elemental way, we can also come to realize that this is nature. This is the nature of Nature. Just like the mountains, the trees, the flowers, the Earth we're on—those are nature. This is the Earth element resting on Earth. So there is a nature within us, and there is a nature without, right around us.

When we have this kind of a realization, our relationships with ourselves and with all that is around us can begin to shift and change. If we care about this body, this being, we care about the beings all around. We care about the Earth we stand on.

Thích Nhất Hạnh[^7] said this: "The Earth is you. You are the Earth. When you realize there is no separation, you fall completely in love with this beautiful planet. At this very moment, the Earth is above you, below you, all around you, and even inside you."

I'm just going to pause for a moment. What's the feeling in your heart when you hear that?

In the love letter Thích Nhất Hạnh wrote to Earth, he says this: "We often forget that the planet we're living on has given us all the elements that make up our bodies. The water in our flesh, our bones, and all the microscopic cells inside our bodies all come from the Earth and are part of the Earth. The Earth is not just the environment we live in. We are the Earth, and we're always carrying her within us. Realizing this, we can see that the Earth is truly alive. We are a living, breathing manifestation of this beautiful and generous planet. Knowing this, we can begin to transform our relationship to the Earth. We can begin to walk differently and to care for her differently."

I would like to extend this even further. Besides the Earth underneath us, all of us, other beings, ourselves, are nature. Animals, animate and inanimate, all beings, all things—we live in a network of connectedness. We can't live without them. Just as how we may transform our relationship with the planet, maybe this practice offers a potential and a possibility in how we relate to each other, relate to ourselves, relate to all beings.

In this way, we can go beyond self-centeredness. This is what the Buddha offered to Rāhula: "And thus should be seen with wise understanding that this is not mine, I am not this, this is not myself." Instead, we extend our heart and mind with boundless love, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity. That's what the Buddha instructed Rāhula. Maybe by dropping away the sense of "I, me, mine," the heart can open. So following the element instruction, the Buddha taught Rāhula to meditate with love, meditate with compassion, meditate with joy, and meditate with equanimity. The heart is ready. The element practice sets a stage for our heart to open and to welcome all beings everywhere.

May this teaching offer this possibility to all of us to live with the reality of our own nature and to love and care for all beings everywhere. Thank you, everyone.

### Reflections

We have a few minutes if there are any questions, comments, or reflections that you may have. You're welcome.

**Audience Member 1:** Um, I can't remember if I read Middle Length Discourse number 62 before or not, but now I want to read it or go back and read it as soon as I have an opportunity. I also wanted to say that, like I think everyone here, I was really divided by the image you brought up of looking around and seeing everyone as skeletons. I don't know if I can be detached enough whenever I'm noticing I have a preference or, you know, a like or dislike towards someone, to look at them that way. I don't know if I can be that detached. But so what I do instead, if I remember to, is to look on other people, especially if I'm noticing a preference or dispreference, and see a fellow sufferer. That's what works for me.

**Speaker:** Beautiful, beautiful. So there are ways that we can shift our perceptions in a way that is supportive for the cultivation of wholesomeness in our mind and heart. So there are many ways that we can see that can be supportive. Great, thank you. Yeah. Someone in the back.

**Audience Member 2:** Okay, um, yeah, so thank you for sharing your story. So you shared that before you went to the swimming pool with your son, you saw the skeletons, and before that, you had weeks of practice. I'm just curious about what kind of practice you were doing for a week? Was it just like meditation, like all day, every day, or...?

**Speaker:** Yeah, so it was as part of a course I was taking, and this set of element practices were part of it, and seeing things in these different ways are part of the practice. So I was quite consciously kind of practicing just wherever I was around and doing things. And in this particular moment, I think it was just the natural momentum of the practice that came alive. I wasn't intentionally trying to do anything, but it just came alive. It's like, "Oh, wow, there is this way of seeing," and then it highlighted something. So, um, it could be sometimes people do see something as a skeleton as an explicit practice, but I think for me, it was really working with the elements that somehow that just arose. Yeah, thank you.

**Audience Member 3 (from YouTube):** Hello, YouTube. Um, I really enjoyed what you had to share today, and I wanted to share an experience that I'm having that is related, just because it so reflects the importance of our honoring Mother Earth, each other, the elements. I feel it's minimizing to say "elements," but even so, um, I have begun working with a beautiful team of women who are doing something called surf therapy. At some point, I will be posting something here. And the focus of it is being in the ocean, being near the water, and that connection, the ways that it heals us, the ways that it lightens us, all the magic that goes on there. And so the timeliness of connecting this to my practice, I appreciate very, very much. And just the reminder to all of us that we can live it. Yes, go out and live it and feed it and nourish it. And I think that that's one way to sustain and ride the waves of life, too. Yes, thank you very much.

**Speaker:** Yeah, beautiful. Thank you for that reflection. And what you brought to me was also, sometimes it's just working in the garden or kitchen, you can then touch the water, the Earth, and it really can kind of shift and change our heart and mind. And so sometimes I just go, you know, get a handful of dirt in my hand, feel the Earth. So yeah, that's a simple way for us to keep connected with this.

Maybe that's enough. And for those who can, join us right after this. We'll have a potluck or just hang around together as a community. And so may you have a wonderful rest of the day and be well.
