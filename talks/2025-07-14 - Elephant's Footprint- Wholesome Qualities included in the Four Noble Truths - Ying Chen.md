So, good morning. Can I check the sound again? If it changed anything, it's good. All right. And a good day for those who are joining through the invisible electrons and the web. I'm very happy to be here. I feel like I haven't been here for a while, so it just really evokes a sense of coming home. It's so good to be with you all this morning.

I brought a teaching today that's inspired by a sutta. This is called the simile of the elephant's footprint. Some of you may know this, and those of you who are interested in reading suttas might have come across this. This particular simile, the elephant's footprint, this teaching is deeply connected with the teachings of the Four Noble Truths. I'll say more about this particular teaching.

The Four Noble Truths is something that is taught across many different Buddhist traditions and is quite well known. The perspectives that I will be drawing from for this teaching will come from something that's inspired by this particular simile and by this particular teaching, as well as some of my ongoing reflections.

So the teachings of the Four Noble Truths, I'll just briefly mention it, and then we'll dive in a little more. There are four truths, maybe ennobling truths. I personally feel a little shy saying the word "truth" because it evokes many different associations with it that may or may not be helpful. But I like the sometimes the translation of it, *sacca*, the Pali word, also means "real," something that's real that we can feel tangibly in our own lives, our own experience.

And so the first thing that's real, called the truth, is the noble truth of *dukkha*[^1]. The translation of *dukkha* might be suffering or stress, and this is where the challenge starts. Often in our culture, we don't like it, so it's easy to skip over the first one very quickly. But it continues, and there is also the origin or the cause of *dukkha*, and that is craving, grasping, clinging. And there is the end of *dukkha*, which is that the very craving can end, grasping can end. It gets better. Sometimes they don't listen long enough to get to that. And there is a practice path that allows us to cultivate our own hearts and minds, that allows the fruit of ending *dukkha* to come forth. So it does get better as this teaching unfolds.

This is a rather significant teaching, in that the insights into these Four Noble Truths is what liberated Gautama for Gautama to become the Buddha. And so it's insights into these four things that are real in our lives that brought liberation for the Buddha. The tradition sometimes holds that this is the first teaching the Buddha offered. Some of you may know this. This is the teachings on setting in motion the dharma wheel. And so the teachings began to turn from the very first teaching that the Buddha offered, and it began to roll on and on and on, all the way to today, this point. And so it's the first turning of the dharma wheel. This is the teaching the Buddha offered, which is the Four Noble Truths and the 12 insights that arose through the practice.

And yet, the teaching can often be overlooked, and then practitioners sometimes can feel that, "I got it, you know, I know this." In a modern culture, we're not always so friendly to pain and distress, and so we can be conditioned to quickly skip over the teaching, just kind of turning away from it. And so our relationship to this teaching can be on the surface level. Ajahn Sucitto[^2] said this Four Noble Truths teaching is an advanced teaching. It calls forth our attention, our curiosity, our interest in this.

In the first turning of the dharma wheel, the Buddha, before he taught, he contemplated and he thought, "Who should I teach first?" It occurred to him he couldn't just go on the street and tell anyone, "Look, this is what I'm going to teach you." He actually reflected and thought, "Oh, maybe it's this..." He was practicing with the five ascetic practitioners for a long time, his ascetic companions who had practiced with him in various ways in the spiritual training, spiritual practice, before the Buddha went on his own, all the way led to his awakening. So he thought, "Well, this is a group of people who may have little dust in their eyes." You may have heard this phrase. "Maybe I should begin with them."

So he went about and found the five ascetic companions and offered the teaching of the Four Noble Truths and the 12 insights to them. And we're very fortunate. In the course of unfolding this particular teaching, one of the five got it. This is venerable Kondañña[^3]. The sutta said he opened the dharma eyes. He saw it, he felt it, and the Buddha felt it. He got it. Wow. So the Buddha got really fired up and he said, "Wow, okay, someone will understand this." And so he went on, started teaching the remaining four, and he just kind of kept on going. Right from there, it launched his 40-plus years of teaching career. I feel very fortunate. This is the beginning of the forming of the Sangha, the beginning of the forming of the long teaching endeavor that the Buddha launched into, and we are the beneficiaries of this first turning. Sometimes I would imagine, what if none of them got it? What would happen? So I didn't let myself think about that too much. But so here we are, so I feel very fortunate.

What I was also struck by is in the Parinibbana Sutta[^4], which is a long sutta that documented the last days of the Buddha's life, here the Buddha again highlighted the teachings of the Four Noble Truths. I want to read a little from this. He said, "Practitioners, due to not understanding and not penetrating the Four Noble Truths, both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long time."

I feel so tender just listening to this. He knew, and he didn't say just "you." "You and I," because we didn't understand this Four Noble Truths and really penetrated it, that we wandered and transmigrated for such a long time. It really touches me to hear this.

And then notice also the words that are used: "not understanding and not penetrating it." And so this is not a kind of a surface level, "we just got it, you know, we read it somewhere and then we're just okay, now I'm done with that." But it's penetrating it. Penetrating it has a flavor of a fullness of human life, a knowingness not just in our intellect.

I've been reading this book by Philip Moffitt called *Dancing with Life*, on the Four Noble Truths and the 12 insights teaching. And so here he says in this book, "The Four Noble Truths is not just a summary guideline, a creed, or a statement of a philosophy, but an actual practice of insight and a realization in and of itself. It's a teaching on how to live wisely."

That's quite something. How to live wisely through this? Is this something real? It's in our lives.

So I am personally affected by my dharma teachers, my teachers, and maybe their teachers, in how they have spent decades reflecting, articulating, and practicing with this teaching. I know for Gil Fronsdal[^5], for probably decades in IMC, the first teaching of the new year is the Four Noble Truths teaching. Some of you may know this, may be aware of this. Every new year, the first talk that Gil gives is around the Four Noble Truths, and it's never the same.

And Philip Moffitt, who wrote this book, *Dancing with Life*, would tell us that he spent years to write this book because he had to practice with it. He had to reflect on it, contemplate it a lot, and it's an ongoing process to this day. And so for me, I dedicated my life this year around the Four Noble Truths. So you're kind of receiving a little bit of a vibe through my own reflection and contemplation and practicing with it. And I have to confess that I haven't gone very far in this whole process. I feel like I'm kind of repeatedly going from the basics, and I feel like I'm not in a big rush, and I really enjoy the process of it. And so today, I hope this also evokes some curiosity in you.

So I want to go back to the simile of the elephant's footprint. This is a sutta, the teaching was offered by the Buddha's great disciple, one of the chief disciples, Sariputta[^6]. And he offered a very detailed elaboration of the Four Noble Truths, and he started this with a very powerful simile. So this is what it says: "The footprints of all creatures that walk can fit inside an elephant's footprint. So an elephant's footprint is said to be the biggest of them all. In the same way, all skillful or wholesome qualities are included in the Four Noble Truths."

For me, often in these similes, I like to just stop and kind of imagine a little bit. What does it feel like? What does it evoke in me? And so I paused and just thought a little bit about all the animals I can think of that walk, how big their footprints are. And I realized this feels right. The elephant footprint is probably the biggest that can hold it all. And so in this way, the Four Noble Truths teaching has a flavor of being encompassing. It's all-encompassing in some way.

And sometimes you may hear the teachers would say, like, the Buddhist teachings can all fit in the Four Noble Truths teaching, and the Buddha taught *dukkha* and the end of *dukkha*. And kind of that's the shorthand. But this particular statement is a little different from that particular pointing. Here Sariputta said this, that is very specific. He said, "All wholesome qualities are included in the Four Noble Truths." The Pali term is *kusala*, sometimes also translated as skillful qualities. So all skillful, wholesome qualities are included here. That's very specific, and for me, it's intriguing. It's really intriguing. It caught my attention when I read this, and it's somewhat ironic because often our associations with the Four Noble Truths teaching is a little bit grim, a little bit like, "Ah, we have to kind of grind our teeth or something." But here it says all wholesome qualities are here, are included in this. I just loved it. That caught my attention to kind of keep going. What is he pointing to? And I thought that's a fantastic and wonderful way to begin this teaching.

So how do we understand this? And Sariputta is quite an amazing teacher. And so he unpacked this in great detail for the rest of the sutta.

I'll also say a little bit about Sariputta, maybe that will help us understand how he was unpacking this teaching. He's quite a unique teacher and unique practitioner. He has a very unique mind, quite detail-oriented, and has a... well, maybe I'll just read this that Ajahn Sucitto, who commented on the sutta, spoke about Sariputta's quality and his contribution in teaching the dharma at the times of the Buddha, and maybe all the way down to today. So he said, "This sutta is a master class on the methods employed by the Buddha's greatest student, Sariputta. He begins with the Four Noble Truths, then proceeds to unpack them systematically, leading to a lengthy analysis of the four elements. But the unpacking takes surprising directions as Sariputta draws on unexpected layers of the dharma to illustrate a familiar teaching in new ways. All the while, he conveys warmth and compassion, illustrating in his manner of teaching the connection that is also the topic of the teaching. Sariputta's emphasis on the Four Noble Truths is shown elsewhere as well, where he's said to focus on teaching new students as far as stream-entry. The current sutta illustrates how he did this, carefully explaining fundamental concepts and showing their real-world impacts while offering pragmatic and reassuring advice along the way. He introduces all the major wisdom teachings, demonstrating exactly how they fit into the Four Noble Truths." That's quite some skill, isn't it?

And I really appreciate Sariputta quite a lot. He seems to have a capacity to kind of, in a way, flip the ladder down all the way to the ground so we can kind of go this step-by-step to understand the teachings. And so sometimes his teachings are not necessarily exactly the same as the Buddha's, but the Buddha often appraised him because he has this capacity to allow people to know. And maybe sometimes the teachings are offered as kind of dropping breadcrumbs, but you can't quite feel the whole thing. And then Sariputta has this capacity to really let you see the whole thing, the whole picture, and then also know the details in some way.

So how did he unfold this? He started with the overarching teaching: the noble truth of suffering, the origin of the suffering, the cessation of the suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of the suffering. But then he didn't just stop there. He went deeper. He drilled down by teasing apart these higher-level concepts and ideas into a more granular and immediately felt kind of experience. So for example, he first explained, kind of teased apart, what does it mean by *dukkha*? What is it? So he kind of unpacked that with a list: there's illness, aging, death, and there is association with the things that we don't like, we don't want, and not getting what we really liked. And so there is all this unpacking he was doing so we can begin to relate to this for ourselves. "Yeah, that's right. That's right."

But again, he didn't stop right there, because that is still at the conceptual level that we're understanding. And so he unpacked all the way to the immediacy of the felt sense of experience, which the teachings sometimes pointed to as the elements. The elemental nature of our experience, that this embodied experience has the earth element in our bones, our teeth, that is solid, firm, steady. And there are water elements, the fluidity of it. And so it's dropping down to the immediate felt sense experience.

And so you can see that the ladders got flipped down. So now he's talking about this *dukkha* not at our thinking level, but at our experiential level, that the experience is like this. Sometimes it's pleasant, sometimes it's unpleasant. And so for me sitting here, I have a fair amount of tightness and tension around my hip, and then there's some pain that's been there for a while. And that's immediate here. Oh, this is how it feels like.

And for me, this is rather game-changing, that we are beginning to deepen in this process of penetration. Sariputta invited us to drop in our experience here and now, and this is where the wholesome qualities begin to emerge. In this process, it almost feels like Sariputta was taking the students on a meditative journey. Now you're feeling and sensing in your immediate experience, and several effects began to emerge in this process. This is my own reflection, I may be departing a little bit from the sutta.

The first one I wanted to point out, the first wholesome quality that many of us might begin to feel as we drop into the immediacy of our experience, is that we are in a raw, direct relationship with our lives. The vibrations in the body, the flow of the breath, the tinkling sensations, the vibrations of the sounds. What you're feeling is a kind of aliveness. Wow. Sometimes I have this feeling. It's like I'm in this really alive feeling with my own life. And just now as we were sitting, there was the sound of the fan, air conditioning, and the sound of the people moving, the sound of the breath, and the inner sound. This kind of soundscape, it just feels like the vibratory feeling of life, and that's enlivening. I don't even know what all the words that we might describe, but there is a certain kind of wholesome quality when we're in the immediacy of our experience. And what it can contrast with is our ongoing movements of wanting, not wanting, pushing away, that actually is deadening. We can begin to know this for ourselves. So the first wholesome quality that Sariputta is pointing out in my own experience is when we're dropping into this experience, and instead of trying to push away, deny, avoid all the pain we have, and then trying to get on to the things that we really want, there is an aliveness that comes forth, maybe in the midst of the difficulties, in the midst of the pain. There can be aliveness, and it's meaningful. It may not be a meaning that you even know the words to say about it, but you can feel, "This is a meaningful way of relating to our lives."

And then the second quality is, as we begin to stay with this experience just as it is, in this raw form, in this more direct form, what Sariputta was pointing out was that more and more clarity began to emerge. We can begin to see how the experience of pleasant and unpleasant is different from our reactivity to the pleasant or the unpleasant. They're not the same thing. Sometimes when we're not seeing this clearly, they just kind of get lumped together as a jumbo, or like, it's automatic, it's not good. But what we can see is, oh, pleasant is just pleasant, and our judgment of whether this is good or bad is another thing, it's a separate thing. They don't have to automatically connect, and our identification with it is yet another thing. You know, maybe someone criticized you. Actually, I was criticized last week or two, and it was unpleasant. I won't say it's pleasant; it's unpleasant. But our often the knee-jerk reaction of, "I need to defend myself," would just come up, right? But in that moment, fortunately, I did not have... I wasn't present for it. I just let myself feel the unpleasant, and there wasn't this kind of reactivity coming up. And what that allowed for me is to notice, "Oh, there is more to this criticism than what it sounds like." It was very intuitive in my system. I didn't even know what it was. I just felt like, "Oh, there's more to this." And so I paused. I didn't respond. I didn't react. And I just kind of let it go. There was a space for it. And a while later, maybe hours later, I discovered the person was going through some real challenging diagnosis.

And so this capacity to be able to drop in this felt-sense, experiential way gives us an opportunity to tease this apart. So here is something, "Ouch," you know, it's *dukkha*, and here is the reactivity. And in this reactivity of judging, trying to fix this, we actually have a choice if we're not flowing with our reactivity. And we can say, "Oh, I can let this go. I don't need to flow with my judgment that I am a failure." That's just extra. So that's another quality, a wholesome quality that can flow from this.

And then yet another wholesome quality can emerge in this process. And that is, as we begin to notice more and more that there is this choice in us that can let go of the grasping, the clinging, the judging, the fixing, there is actually more freedom. There is more peace and harmony that's available in us. And so this is being pointed to as the third noble truth: that possibility of, "Oh, if there is no continual fueling of this wanting mind, there can be moments of harmony, peace with what I'm experiencing," whether it's experiencing in our own hearts or what we feel in the surroundings that we're interacting with. And so that also becomes available to us.

And we will also notice in this process is we lose our mindfulness, and it's not automatic that we are able to simply somehow stay with our experience in this direct, immediate way, losing to our stories, our beliefs. And we begin to notice, "Oh, this heart and mind is to be cultivated." And so yet another wholesome quality that can emerge, which is being pointed to as the fourth noble truth, is we give ourselves over to the practice. We offer ourselves to practice sincerely.

So in this way, what is being pointed to in these Four Noble Truths, each of the Four Noble Truths, began to manifest themselves as wholesome qualities. The wholesome quality of being with our experience as they are, including the pain and the pleasure, difficulties, challenges, and that's a wholesome quality, pointed to as the first noble truth. And the wholesome quality of clarifying our lived experience, the first arrow versus the second arrow, the reactivities. And so we can begin to clarify this in ourselves. And the wholesome quality of the possibility of having freedom and ease that's available to us when we're letting go of our clinging, existing, demanding. And the wholesome quality of giving ourselves to the sincere practice.

Sometimes, and I know some people would ask, "If things ever get easier through the practice?" I like that question, and I've reflected about that question a lot. You know, on one level, the conditions of our lives are often not under our control. It's hard to say how things might be getting easier or harder, whether it's because of the broader environment we're in or because of individual situations. In my broader household, there was a car accident. Not easy, very difficult, very difficult for many people involved. But this practice, through this practice, what we're learning is to cultivate a kind of capacity that allows us to relate to our lives and our life events, life situations, with more and more wholesome ways that allow us to have a sense of ease, a sense of harmony in the midst of difficulties. And so in that way, whether you call it easier or better, I don't know. But there is a possibility. There is a possibility. And this kind of wholesome orientation is more and more independent of the life situations or the conditions that we're in. And this is what this teaching is pointing to: that how we relate to our lives is the empowerment that each of us has.

And so as all of us connect to this teaching in some way, maybe in a very moderate way, we just heard this, you just have a little sense of it. My invitation is to know what is called forth from this teaching is to let the teaching come alive. So it's real. We can have a real felt sense of it and let that guide us in how we relate to our lives.

So, thank you. Thank you everyone for your attention.

***

We only have a few minutes. Maybe just a short comment or a question. I'm happy to stay over and after and respond in any way that I can. Anyone like to share a comment or share your own reflection or a question? Just a short one before we end.

**Questioner 1:** Yeah, thanks for the talk. I think one of the things I'm learning, and maybe you can speak to it, is that I don't actually want... I'm not actually interested in freedom as much as wanting what I want. And then the path is like getting me to be more peaceful or more this or more that. Is that something that you've encountered yourself, this like, "I don't actually want to be free, I want to be happy" kind of thing?

**Ying Chen:** Yeah. So that's good. I don't know what all the words might be, you know. And so, it might be worthwhile to turn that question around to see if this is what, if this is my aspiration, how am I relating to this aspiration? How does it manifest for me right now, if that's what's aspiring for me? Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

**Questioner 1:** Thank you.

**Ying Chen:** If there's another short one or a short comment, there's one right here.

**Questioner 2:** I just, I really appreciated the piece about pleasant and unpleasant and how we think about that.

**Ying Chen:** Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. We have a lot of associations about pleasant, unpleasant, what it can mean to us. So this is a real worthy process in our practice, is to begin to tease that apart. Kind of like what Sariputta is pointing to. It's like, "Oh, there is pleasant, there's unpleasant. How do we associate with this?" You know, it's like immediately, "I don't like this. I would rather it go away," or, "I'm fearful." So we can begin to tease apart all of this. So, it's great. Thank you. Yeah.

So maybe we'll end with a dedication of merit together. And I really feel grateful for us to have this opportunity to practice together and to learn the dharma practice and to learn the dharma teachings together. I still feel that resonance of this first turning of the dharma wheel, kind of we're in this long stream. And so may whatever benefits that arose out of our own practice and our own learning, may it ripple out in all directions. So all the beings everywhere, may they be benefited in some way. Maybe it's a kind of ease of the heart, clarity of the mind, or healthy, vital bodies. May they all be happy. May they all be peaceful. And may we all, everyone everywhere, experience liberating wisdom and compassion in our own hearts and minds and everywhere for all beings. Thank you. Thank you everyone.
