Good morning and welcome again to IMC. Our teacher this morning is our own Diana Clark.

(Gloria Schulz): Could I please make an announcement before the talk starts? My name is Gloria Schulz. I'm a longtime member of IMC, and about 10 years ago, I heard a Threshold Choir presentation here and knew right away that I wanted to join. It has become a very meaningful volunteer job for me. Next Sunday, we will be offering a special program from 1 to 2. It is quiet, meditative music, followed by silence, and then another song. We offer our songs primarily for people who are in a hospice, hospitals, extended care facilities, or in crisis. Thank you.

(Diana Clark): Good morning. It's nice to see you all, and it's nice to be here. Some of you may know me; I'm Diana Clark. I teach here on Monday nights, and here I am on a Sunday morning. Some of you may be listening to Gil's 7 a.m. [sit] and you may know that I substituted for him a couple of weeks ago when I talked a little bit about poetry and practice. I'd like to extend a little bit what I spoke about then, and if you didn't hear that, it's perfectly fine too.

What I'd like to talk about is the way that practice meets our life. I know certainly for me, at the beginning, there was a clear distinction between practice and life. I would listen to Dharma talks or read Dharma books, and they really touched me and felt like something really powerful was there. But then I would just go off into my life, my regular life, whatever that was. But the more I read Dharma books, listened to Dharma talks, and meditated, the more I started to see that these two things—practice and life—started to come closer and closer together. The distinction between them started to blur. Things that I thought were these conceptual understandings that I had started to just show up in the way that I was being in the world.

I've told this story a number of times, but a really clear example for me is this idea of behaving ethically. I thought of myself as an ethical person; I wasn't going around stealing things or harming people, but I was doing an awful lot of little white lies. When I looked at it, it was to make myself look better or not to hurt the feelings of other people. So when I started to take seriously, "Well, what is this thing about the Buddhist life, talking about behaving ethically and this wish to not harm others?" I said, "Okay, I'm going to stop these little white lies," such as, "Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, the traffic was really bad." The traffic wasn't bad; I was just disorganized. And then when I realized that I'm going to have to say why I'm really late, I started to get more organized because I didn't want to have to lie. There are all these small ways in which I just started to treat the people that I was meeting with respect, showing up on time, and that just started to shift my life a little bit and the way that I was showing up. This small thing was how my practice and life started to come together. And now, here we are all these years later, and I find myself in the seat as a Dharma teacher, certainly not expecting that way back when.

So I'd like to talk a little bit about this: when practice meets life, what does that mean? How does it show up?

First of all, I'd like to say that there are different ways in which we might approach or understand practice. One way is that there are particular steps, there are directions, there are things that we do: 16 steps of anapanasati[^1], one, two, three, and go through the way. Or maybe we have to balance the five faculties. "Okay, is it energy, concentration... wait, what was the other one?" Often we can't keep them in our minds. There's this real clear set of lists and ways to practice, and we have a certain direction and a certain approach. And certainly, this works in other areas of our lives—in our professional life, in our educational life—and it works in our practice life too, until it doesn't. So that's certainly one way to practice: beneficial, supportive, appropriate.

But I also want to mention that there's another way to practice. This is with the same directionality, with the same sense of more freedom and more ease, but instead of being supported by lists and directions, it's more supported by a sense of feeling, of experience. This way leads to more freedom. When I behave or experience things this way, it leads to less freedom, more Dukkha[^2]. This way feels more spacious, easeful, open, expansive. This other way feels a little more forced and pushing. So, feeling our way with practice—not so much a conceptual understanding, but more just experiencing.

I want to say that the Buddha, before his awakening, right before he had this insight into the Four Noble Truths that characterized his awakening—this understanding about Dukkha—he described what it was like right before he had this life-changing insight. He describes that his mind was malleable and wieldy. So there's this sense that there's not just one way, but a sense of flexibility to what's appropriate, what's happening. There's a way in which we can practice that is about the directions and these numbered lists and these conceptual understandings, and a way in which we're feeling, experiencing our way towards greater peace, ease, and freedom. Part of practice is to be able to do both. Chances are, all of us have preferences for one way or the other. But can we practice in such a way that we stretch what's comfortable for us, so that we can do both? So that we can find our way to the greatest ease and freedom using whichever approach is appropriate at that time.

These two different ways—one I'm calling maybe "feeling" or "experiencing" versus more of a "conceptual understanding"—we might say has some similarity to how poetry is more about feeling and experiencing, versus prose or lists, which are more about conceptual understanding. To be sure, we need both. But I like something that E.E. Cummings[^3] said. Many of you all know he's a famous American poet from the 20th century. He said or wrote: "A poet is somebody who feels, and who expresses their feelings through words. This may sound easy. It isn't. A lot of people think or believe or know they feel, but that's thinking or believing or knowing, not feeling. And poetry is feeling."

So in this way, I'd like to talk a little bit about poetry and practice and how practice meets our life, using a poem to help point the way in which we might feel this way. The poem I'd like to talk about is the one that I dropped in during our guided meditation. It's called "Tree" by Jane Hirshfield[^4]. Jane Hirshfield is an American poet. She lives here in Marin County. She is a Zen practitioner. She lived at Tassajara; in fact, I think she overlapped with Gil down in Tassajara at the same time. She practiced at San Francisco Zen Center and Green Gulch Farm. So I like to think that she's one of our brethren, part of our community. She's also a translator; she translates, with another person, poems from Japanese from about a thousand years ago, some women poets, some of their awakening poems. She has books of her poems, but she also has books about poetry.

Here's Jane Hirshfield's poem called "Tree":

> It is foolish
> to let a young Redwood
> grow next to a house.
>
> Even in this one lifetime,
> you will have to choose.
>
> That great calm being,
> this clutter of soup pots and books.
>
> Already the first branch-tips
> brush at the window.
>
> Softly, calmly,
> immensity taps at your life.

What does this mean, this idea of a tree? We know that for the Buddha, he sat underneath a Bodhi tree, and a Bodhi tree has a lot of significance in Buddhism. The icon for Insight Meditation Center is a little Bodhi leaf from a Bodhi tree. For Jane Hirshfield, here in the Bay Area and Marin County, it is a redwood tree. We have redwood trees just right out here, and something that I love about redwood trees—maybe all of you do too—is there's something majestic about them, something cathedral-like when you're in a grove of redwood trees. The redwood trees are so powerful, too. Some of you may know that just a few years ago, maybe five years ago, the redwood tree out here in front was causing the sidewalk to buckle. The roots were getting in the way, and it was a tripping hazard. We thought, "Okay, we have to take care of this. We don't want people to trip on the sidewalk." So we partnered with the city to come in and redo the sidewalk. I think everybody was—I should say I was very surprised—the city was quite wise. They didn't build a sidewalk over the tree roots; they built around it. They recognized the power of these trees to disrupt whatever gets in their way. They weren't going to set up a battle with this tree; they just went around. So if you go out there right now, you'll notice the sidewalk goes around this tree.

There's this way in which a tree can represent practice, in that it grows. And certainly, we have in the teachings this idea of something that gets cultivated and developed in the same way that trees get cultivated and developed and grow. And then this idea of letting a young redwood grow next to a house. In the Buddhist teachings, the Buddha, after his awakening, spoke a little bit about how his mind was wieldy before his awakening. After his awakening, the tradition holds that he said this short verse, kind of describing the experience of awakening. This is captured in the Dhammapada[^5]:

> House-builder, you are seen!
> You will not build a house again.
> All the rafters are broken,
> the ridge-pole dismantled.
> This mind, gone to the unconstructed,
> has reached the end of craving.

So the Buddha is equating this awakening with the end of the house-builder. That house can represent the sense of self, this thing that we create and that we believe we're inhabiting, something that protects us and we can hide behind. But all the while, maybe not recognizing that it is constructed and that it doesn't have to be there. But we are so accustomed to it. Of course, we have houses and we want to have houses, but there's a way in which a house can also be this way in which we set up our identities, the things that define who we are, which in the same way limit who we are.

"It is foolish to let a young Redwood grow next to a house." I like this idea of "foolish." In Pali[^6], the language of the early Buddhist scriptures, the same word means "foolish" and "child." So it's just the same way that somebody doesn't know yet; they just haven't learned yet. A fool is just someone who hasn't gained some particular knowledge or some particular wisdom.

"Even in this one lifetime, you will have to choose. That great calm being, this clutter of soup pots and books." Practice disrupts the way that we consider ourselves. Even in this one lifetime, we will have to choose. This is the recognition that if we want to continue to practice, we can't have our life be exactly the way that it was, including this house, this way that we consider ourselves. So often, we want to be exactly the same, not change things, but just want less suffering. Of course we do. But we don't recognize that having less suffering means that some things have to shift and change about ourselves: the way that we think about ourselves, the way we think about the world, the way we think about others, the way that we feel about ourselves, feel about others. That's where the real freedom comes. And part of practice is to help us to gain the confidence that we can make these changes. Part of practicing is to help us to feel more clearly what is the direction for more spaciousness and ease and freedom, and what is the direction that leads to more Dukkha, more suffering.

There are so many ways that, certainly for me when I first started practice, I had no idea of all the subtle ways in which I was holding on to these ideas of myself. I was still working in corporate America, I had a great job, and I didn't realize how I was identified with that job and how every little slight thing that didn't go well really rocked me. But practice is a way that it grows, and we start to see more clearly, maybe gain more wisdom, and feel more clearly. And not only that, have the confidence to maybe let go of some of the ways that we think about ourselves or we think about the world, or the way we set up "me versus you," "us versus them." And we start to see how that is such a great source of suffering for us, for everybody.

But you have to choose that great calm being. This tree—especially redwood trees, in my view—has a certain nobility, steadiness, calmness, stability. Maybe this is something that you've touched into with your meditation practice, recognizing, "Oh yeah, this calmness is possible. It's available." I'm not saying it's always easy and we always have access to it, but to even recognize that that is possible for our lives and possible to be more and more in our life.

"This clutter of soup pots and books." I love this line. In my mind, it's a little bit autobiographical. In my mind, Jane Hirshfield has a kitchen full of all kinds of pots and books. Being a poet, it's not surprising maybe she has a lot of books. I have a lot of books; I can't help myself. And so practice isn't asking us to let go of all of our soup pots and books, whatever the equivalent of that might be for you. Practice isn't saying that you can't have any of those things. Instead, I think what the key word here is "clutter"—things that aren't tended to, things that are getting in the way of something else that we want to do, maybe getting in the way of some of this calmness or stability that we know is possible. So it's not so much that we have to get rid of all these objects in our life that fill up our house. Instead, it's about a shift in our relationship to them. Maybe we're not clinging, or maybe we're not dishonoring them and just letting them fill up our life instead of taking care of them. So the clutter, maybe it's literal, maybe it's figurative, but this kind of choosing, recognizing, feeling, "Yeah, there's this something deep inside." Maybe it's not even deep inside; maybe it's just found when we go for a walk, versus some of the agitation that we feel in so many areas of our life. Possibly, we might ask ourselves, what is our life filled with that's the opposite of calm? What would it mean to choose the calm, not the clutter?

There's also this way in which practice asks us to soften, let go of all the ways in which we build these selves, ways in which we limit ourselves, and instead to feel the freedom that is available. Maybe we've all had just a glimpse of what's available. Chances are you have, otherwise you wouldn't be coming to a place like this.

Here's another poem that's very short. This one's translated by Jane Hirshfield, the same poet who wrote the other poem. She translated this with Mariko Aratani[^7]. This poem was written in Japanese by Izumi Shikibu[^8] around the year 1000. I love this poem. It's very uses metaphor and it's very evocative, I think. The poem goes like this:

> Although the wind blows terribly here,
> the moonlight also leaks
> between the roof-planks
> of this ruined house.

"Although the wind blows terribly here, the moonlight also leaks between the roof-planks of this ruined house." This ruined house—maybe this way we're letting our sense of self or this identity, these things that we hide behind, maybe we're letting some ruined planks... the roof isn't quite as tight as it used to be, and moonlight is shining in. Some of you know, in Buddhism, often the full moon is a symbol of awakening, enlightenment. But no matter about that, there's something, at least I feel this when I go outside and "Oh, it's a full moon." I've done that a number of times here when I taught on Monday nights, and to walk outside after teaching and to see this big moon, it just feels like, "Oh, something's special." And so the way that this house kind of starts to crack and the roof has leaks in it, maybe it's windy, which means we feel things, but the moonlight is shining through. There's this way in which there's this sense of freedom and beauty and possibility that the full moon can represent.

So then returning back to this poem, "Tree," by Jane Hirshfield, it continues and it says: "Already the first branch-tips brush at the window." By the time a redwood tree's branch tips are brushing on the window, the roots are already underneath, right? They're in the sewage system, they're under the house, they're making the sidewalk buckle. You know, here at IMC, we have to call Roto-Rooter [?] on a regular basis because that redwood tree out there is getting into our pipes. So maybe by the time we already notice that something's here, it's already touched us. It's already a part of our life in some way, but maybe it's under... we haven't quite seen it, the way that roots we don't see until they are disruptive or something like this.

Also, this idea of the branch tips meeting the house. So much about practice is about meeting ourselves, maybe in a way that we haven't before. And let's be honest, it's not always good news. I know for me, it wasn't always good news, noticing all these white lies I was doing and all these ways in which I was holding and clinging on to these ideas about myself. And I wanted people to make sure that they saw me in one particular way and certainly not this other particular way which I was trying to secretly hide. But I also like this expression that Jack Kornfield uses, kind of like meeting ourselves. He uses this expression, "The unfinished business of the heart." There's a way in which meeting ourselves is a way of recognizing this unfinished business of the heart, and maybe it allows this business of the heart to get finished, to be metabolized and worked through and met and seen. So often we're trying to discard or disown or somehow excise these portions of ourselves because they're painful or they're ugly or whatever it might be we think that it might be. But so much about practice is meeting all of these aspects of ourselves when we're ready. We don't have to jump into the most difficult parts of our lives at the outset. Instead, we allow practice to grow. We water it, we let it have sunshine, good soil, and then practice grows. As it grows, we don't have to make it grow. Maybe it's just a way in which we come back, we come to IMC on Sunday mornings or whatever it might be, listen to YouTube.

And then there's this way in which this poem ends. For me, it's kind of powerful. I love this line:

> Softly, calmly,
> immensity taps at your life.

This invitation for all of us to maybe step into what's possible for us, our biggest life, our best life. And it's softly, calmly. It's not with a sledgehammer. Sometimes it feels that way, but maybe there's a certain insistence of an invitation, asking us to be the best versions of ourselves, bringing our best wisdom, bringing our best compassion to whatever life brings us. After all, what else can we do? We can't control the whole world. I know we try, certainly I try. It doesn't work, we know that. And instead, there can be this invitation to bring our best selves.

And I love this word "immensity." Like maybe it's bigger than what we can imagine. Maybe it's bigger than what we suspect is available or what it would be like to have more freedom. And in this way, in this poem, and I would say in practice, this freedom is tied up with this house that we're building and constructing and renovating, maybe, but still having constructed. It's a way in which it can be an inhibition to freedom. So freedom is a way of maybe we let some of this building just naturally deteriorate. We wouldn't want to do this in our actual houses, but in these senses of selves, is there a way that we can let some of these moonbeams of freedom shine in and allowing ourselves to be touched by it?

Softly, calmly, immensity taps at your life.

Thank you.

And so maybe as an ending here, can you just turn to some people near you? And let's all take care of each other, let's not let anybody be left behind with nobody talking to them. We don't want that. And just say, what did you think of this poem? Maybe it's like, "Poetry is just not my cup of tea," perfectly fine. Or maybe you're like, "I don't know, I don't get it," that's perfectly fine too. Or you might feel like, "I don't know, I'm kind of curious. I'm going to go outside and look at this tree now," or whatever it might be. Whatever it might be, just turn to somebody and maybe say a little bit about how this poem touched you. Thank you.
