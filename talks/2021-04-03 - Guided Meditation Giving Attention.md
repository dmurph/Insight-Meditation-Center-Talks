Warm greetings to everyone. It feels wonderful that we're gathering here for our meditation together. I just saw a message that one of our members, Jay, is having heart surgery today. We wish Jay well and hope that it all goes well.

We sit here holding all of ourselves and everyone in our hearts, including those going through surgery and facing challenges of all kinds today.

Perhaps it's fitting that this final step of mindfulness of breathing is very closely associated with generosity.[^1] I'll talk more about it during the talk, but when we remove an obstruction for someone, like opening a door for someone who can't do it themselves, that act of removing the obstruction is an act of generosity. If someone has a splinter in their foot and they can't get it out themselves, it's an act of generosity to get some tweezers and remove the splinter. In the same way, the removal, the letting go, the stepping away from those movements of the mind which don't serve us can be seen as an act of generosity, not as an indication of aversion or pushing things away, or some negative thing about anything. Rather, it's just such a healthy thing to remove the splinters of our life, to move away from the ways that we harm ourselves.

We get a clearer sense of that harm, even the subtlest forms, the more settled and peaceful we become in meditation. The more meditation feels like a place of freedom, love, peace, integrity, and wholeness, the more quiet and still the thinking mind becomes. The more we recognize movements of generosity, we recognize the splinters that we can take out. Letting go of thoughts doesn't so much come from aversion, but comes from a sense of, "Of course, let me help out here. Let me let go of these thoughts, these ideas." When we get contracted or caught in desires and aversions, of course, it's a generous thing to let go. It doesn't have to be done with an obligation to let go; it doesn't have to be done with hostility towards what we're letting go of, any more than when opening a door we are hostile to the door, or when pulling out a splinter we are hostile to the splinter. Rather, it's an act of generosity.

So, to sit today, maybe we can do so with a spirit of generosity.

To begin, consider your posture. The care we put into our posture—maybe rocking around, swaying a little bit, making small adjustments—can be seen as the beginning of meditative generosity as we give attention to our body, to ourselves. We might take a few long, slow, deep breaths. As we settle in, maybe it's even a giving in, a generosity of letting go of tension and giving ourselves the goodness of being stable and settled here.

With a feeling of generosity, of care, of goodwill towards oneself, tenderly, maybe as you exhale, relax the body. Perhaps soften the belly. Perhaps soften and relax the belly with a reminder to it: "It's okay."

As you exhale, relax in the heart. A generous feeling, even if the heart aches or is challenged in some way, is to hold it with generosity, goodwill, and compassion, allowing the chest and the heart to settle and relax.

Relax the shoulders. Maybe even move the hands a little bit if it frees up the shoulders and the elbows. And as an act of generosity to your face, which has muscles that are working for us all day long, one way or the other, those little muscles are expressing themselves. Generously give those muscles a chance to rest. "Thank you for your service, and now you can rest." Relax the face.

Then, offer your attention to the breathing. As if attention is a gift, a precious gift that's worth giving over to the breathing. As if the body, breathing, loves the gift of attention.

If you notice yourself thinking, caught up in thought, lost in thought, see it as an occasion to be generous. To give up your thinking, to let it go, so that you can return to a way of being that's more intimate, more connected here and now. A way of being present that is more satisfying than being lost or caught up in thoughts. Generously return yourself to yourself. In the letting go of thoughts, you are opening the doors of the heart and the mind, pulling out the splinters in the heart.

So as we sit here today, if it can help you become quieter and more focused, more present, you might practice giving away your thoughts—giving up, letting go, releasing, relinquishing—all as movements of generosity. A generosity perhaps associated with a deep, quiet place inside of you.

Let go of your thinking generously. In letting go of it, you can return to some intimacy and peace, some sense of stillness here that's better than being lost in thought. Give yourself the gift of that "better."

And then, as we come to the end of the sitting, if it is in fact a form of generosity to give yourself the chance to settle in, to come to a place here in meditation that clearly feels like it's for your own welfare and well-being, then you might also consider that this generosity towards yourself can simultaneously be a generosity for the world. That somehow, by settling in in such a way, the best qualities of who you are come to the forefront, or are not eclipsed. Then the world can also benefit from these good qualities of yours, beginning perhaps with generosity—being generous to the world around you. Not necessarily generous with things, but generous with your attention, your heart. Generously letting go of the obstructions inside of you that prevent you from having a clean presence with others, to offer them the best of who you are.

If we offer the best of who we are, then we benefit others while we benefit ourselves. We are benefiting ourselves when we benefit others. When we give the best that we have, coming from a good way, then we benefit as well; we benefit further. At the end of a meditation session or a Buddhist event, there's a practice called "dedication of merit."[^2] It's understood that if you give away your merit, you produce much more merit for yourself. If you can, in a clean, appropriate way, offer the best of yourself to others, the best in you can grow.

May it be that any of the benefits that we receive through this meditation today, that we remove the obstructions from letting that be shared with the world around us.

May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
And may all beings everywhere be free.

[^1]: The speaker is likely referring to the final tetrad of the 16 steps in the Ānāpānasati Sutta (The Discourse on Mindfulness of Breathing). These final steps focus on contemplating impermanence, detachment, and ultimately, relinquishment (paṭinissaggā), which is framed here as an act of generosity.
[^2]: **Dedication of Merit (puñña parināmanā):** A common practice in many Buddhist traditions. It involves the devotional act of "giving away" the positive karmic energy or "merit" accumulated from wholesome actions (like meditation, chanting, or acts of kindness) for the benefit and welfare of all sentient beings. The belief is that sharing merit does not diminish one's own, but rather multiplies it.
