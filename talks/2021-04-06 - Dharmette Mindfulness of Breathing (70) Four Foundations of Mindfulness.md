As a way of continuing the discussion of the Buddha's teachings on Ānāpānasati,¹ or mindfulness of breathing, the Buddha presents these 16 steps and then clearly shows their connection to two other important meditation teachings he has. One is the teachings on what's usually called the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, and the other is what's usually called the Seven Factors of Awakening.

It's really wonderful the way that, rather than many people feeling that practicing the Four Foundations of Mindfulness is a very different practice than practicing mindfulness of breathing—and certainly the way they're taught is often the case—they also come together. Mindfulness of breathing enters into the same domain, the same area of life, as the Four Foundations of Mindfulness.

The way the Buddha does this is that there are four tetrads² in the 16 steps of Ānāpānasati, and he says each tetrad corresponds to one of the foundations of mindfulness. The foundation of mindfulness that's based on the body corresponds to the first four steps of breathing: being aware of the long breath, being aware of the short breath, being aware of the whole body as you breathe, and then being aware of the body calming and relaxing as you breathe. So, it's all about the body. When that becomes really well established, all four of these steps, and awareness has become strong, then the awareness is based on the body. In the first foundation of mindfulness, it's really about establishing awareness on the basis of the body. Classically, there's a series of exercises or different ways of practicing mindfulness, all for the purpose of establishing a strong mindfulness awareness in the body.

The second tetrad, steps five to eight, corresponds to the second foundation of mindfulness: the foundation of mindfulness on feelings. The second tetrad of Ānāpānasati is experiencing joy as we breathe, feeling happiness as we breathe, experiencing the mental activity, and then relaxing the mental activity. This word "experiencing" could also be translated as "feeling"; it has the same root in the Pāli³ language. So, feeling joy, feeling happiness, feeling the mental activity, and then relaxing the mental activity—this corresponds to the foundation of mindfulness on feeling.

The third tetrad has to do all about the mind, and the third foundation is all about the mind. In the breathing exercises, it's experiencing the mind, not just the activity, but the whole mind: gladdening the mind, settling, stabilizing, concentrating the mind, and then liberating the mind. In the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, it's in part about understanding really high-quality states of mind, and these high qualities of mind correspond roughly with gladdening, concentrating, and liberating the mind.

Then the last tetrad is all about observing: observing impermanence, observing fading away, cessation, and relinquishment. These are the deep insights. The fourth foundation of mindfulness is also about insights. It's insight into seeing the arising and passing, how hindrances arise and they go, and seeing how our suffering comes and goes. That's the first of the observations of the fourth tetrad: observing inconstancy or change, and the others follow in the wake of that.

So the Buddha corresponds these two; the four foundations are equal to the four tetrads, but not just automatically. It's when awareness is well established in each of these areas, when we're really grounded and centered and present in a full way without being distracted or thinking a lot about the past and the future. This precious thing that we have—being aware, being able to really experience the present moment, sense the present moment, feel the present moment, know the present moment in all the dimensions of knowing. Not just know it fleetingly, but to feel that now we're centered, we're rooted, we're grounded here.

This feeling of being really here, definitely being grounded, resting here, is kind of like the difference between being in a rowboat being tossed around in the sea, and then coming up on dry land. Now you feel like it's stable and strong. Here we are. There's a qualitative shift, a quantum shift that can happen inside when, boom, we're here. We don't have to work at being here and come back and remember to be present. We're not liable to wander off, and the awareness then becomes strong and established.

The translation I like for the Four Foundations of Mindfulness is the four bases for establishing awareness. And then when the Buddha correlates these foundations and the four tetrads, in the fourth one he says, then mindfulness of the dharmas⁴ is well established. So there's a strong level of equanimity.⁵ This is one of the directions the practice goes when there's stability. Boom, we're here. Then we're here in such a strong way that we're not easily tossed around by the changing circumstances of our life. We're not easily losing our equanimity, our balance, our peacefulness. When a difficult thought arises, it just arises and goes. When there are difficult, painful sensations in the body, we can just feel them and know them, but the mind doesn't get agitated or disturbed. This is called equanimity, a lack of agitation and being disturbed.

So both these practices—the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, whatever way you've been taught to do them, and there are many ways mindfulness is taught, or the mindfulness of breathing—whatever those practices are, they're all for the purpose, ultimately in Buddhist practice, to come to a kind of dwelling, resting, abiding, aware in the present moment without any tendency to leave that and wander off.

Some people will use the expression "lucid awareness." When awareness is not ruffled, when our sense of mindfulness is not ruffled by what we know, that knowing becomes free and independent of what is known. We can't separate what we know from knowing completely, but the knowing is not ruffled, it's not agitated, it's not entangled, it's not clinging to what is known. This idea of knowing something with that kind of freedom, that equanimity, is really the place where all the different practices of mindfulness, all the different ways of Vipassanā⁶ practice, come together and set the stage for awakening.

Tomorrow I'll talk about how this is connected to the Seven Factors of Awakening. I love this because it's creating a harmony or unity in the Buddhist teachings; we start seeing how they all come together as a whole. In the way that this discourse on Ānāpānasati begins, it begins with the senior disciples of the Buddha coming together with all their disciples and living together for a period of months in unity and harmony, receiving the Buddha's teaching. So, to have that sense of unity and harmony with all the different sides of who we are, that we could all come together and live under the full moon of our lucid awareness.

Thank you. We'll continue along this path of the Ānāpānasati. Tomorrow is the Seven Factors of Awakening, and then we'll see by Thursday how the practice changes when a person has not just learned how to be stably aware here, but has experienced a degree of real liberation, freedom from clinging, and how the practice changes at that point. So we continue, and we're almost at the end of this Ānāpānasati series. Thank you.
