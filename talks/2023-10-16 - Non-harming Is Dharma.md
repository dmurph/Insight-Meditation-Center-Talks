So, I'm going to tell you a tale about a monk, and I want to dedicate the tale to a wonderful monk that I met many years ago named Yanda.[^1] He was the monk responsible for the Burmese temple back then in Daly City. Eventually, he moved down and built the temple that's now just south of Half Moon Bay. Back then, the so-called temple was just a small, regular-looking house in Daly City.

When I was going to practice in Burma, I heard about this monk, so I called him up and said, "Can I come visit you?" He said, "Sure." I think I took some bus and walked some way into the neighborhood. I knocked on the door, and he answered. The remarkable thing about how he received me was that I immediately felt like I'd been his friend for decades. It was like we were old friends; that's the best way I could describe how he received me. He had never met me. He brought me in, and we sat and talked. The kindness, warmth, and friendliness that he offered were outstanding, given that we were strangers. So, the tale is dedicated to Yanda.

There was this Buddhist monk who was traveling around, and he came to a town where there had never been any Buddhists before. People hardly knew what Buddhism was. He stayed there for some while, and the people in the town kind of liked him. He seemed to be remarkably calm and peaceful, and people felt really safe with him. Some people started telling him their life story, their challenges, and it was just so nice. He didn't seem to have a lot to tell them, but they left those encounters with him changed, just because he was so friendly, kind, and receptive to what they had to say.

A local professor of religion heard about the monk and was interested in Buddhism. "What is this Buddhism?" She had never met a Buddhist before, so there was a chance to learn something. She came to visit him, and she wanted to find out what Buddhism is. So she asked what seemed to her like the obvious questions.

She asked him, "What do you believe?"

He answered, "Long ago, I believed, but now I act."

She was a little confused by this answer. Don't all religions have beliefs? Could he not have just told her? So she asked again, in a different way, "What teachings do you rely on?"

"Long ago, I relied on teachings. Now I rely on what I know."

"But of course, he was a Buddhist monk, right?" she thought. So she tried again. "Aren't you devoted to the Buddha? You're a follower of the Buddha, right?"

"Long ago, I was devoted to the Buddha, but now I am devoted to non-harming."

"But what do you have faith in?" she said, trying again all the ways in which she understood what religion is. "What do you have faith in?"

"I don't have faith. I have confidence in non-harming action."

"But what is your ultimate truth?"

"The end of doing any harm to myself or to others."

"But... but... but this is nothing like religion in her mind. But then you are left with no desire for a good life hereafter?" In many religions, that's an important part. "Are you left with no desire for a good life hereafter?"

"I have no desire for a life hereafter. I desire a good life now. The rest will take care of itself."

"But... but... but what is the good life now?"

"A life lived without any deliberate act of body, speech, or mind that harms self or others."

Then, she had heard that in Buddhism you're not supposed to have any desires, so she thought she would finally ask a "Buddhist" question, she was so confused by this time. "Do you have no desires?"

"No, I desire a world committed to non-harming."

He answered her questions so kindly and calmly, without any sense that she was wrong or any hostility. She was left confused; it didn't fit any of her ideas of what religion is, but she left transformed in some way, changed.

I offer that tale as a way of suggesting that Buddhism has a radically different orientation than what most people think of as religion, and that this idea of non-harming lies at the center of what Buddhism is. Maybe the ultimate goal is non-harming. Some people will feel that's not good enough because religions have ultimate truths, ultimate purposes, ultimate goals, ultimate experiences of enlightenment. Wouldn't that be nice to be enlightened? What is enlightenment? To be so fully transformed that a person will have no deliberate attempts to harm anyone in the world, including themselves. That's what enlightenment is. But we don't usually say that because I don't think people get so excited by non-harming. You know, if you said the ultimate goal is to realize the truth, oh, that seems pretty good. Or the ultimate enlightenment is to realize the highest possible human realization of liberation. You know, then I get liberated. That's really great, isn't it? Don't you want to be liberated? That's exciting. But to realize non-harming... that is a transformation. It is a liberation. It's a liberation from doing anything at all that causes harm.

"But... but... but that's not about me. Isn't enlightenment about something for me?"

Well, you stop causing harm to yourself. Isn't that pretty good?

"You know, I don't harm myself that much. I just... suffer."

Then the monk would say, "Well, in that case, you should look more deeply to see what you're doing." The core four teachings of Buddhism, often called the Four Noble Truths, don't have the word "harm" in them. They have the word *dukkha*,[^2] which is usually translated to English as "suffering." It literally means pain. But the causes of that suffering, the causes of that pain, are our activities. What we're focusing on is not what the world does to us, but what we do to ourselves. So if the world does something unfortunate to us, that's unfortunate, and we have to do our best to figure out what to do. But if because of that, we now want to hate, and because of that, we want to now harm others, in that momentum, we're harming ourselves. Hate always harms the hater. Intentional violence always harms the one who is violent. It can't not, but we're not often paying attention that way. So that's why you study yourself, see what's going on deeply.

And if you go really deep, you also see that the suffering that we can have some role in changing and transforming is the one that arises from our own attachments. To cling is to harm ourselves. And it's not necessarily an ethical thing. So often we think of harming others as being unethical, but being attached is not an ethical issue. But it is an issue of whether you are happy or whether you suffer. And there's a way in which attachment is the root way in which we harm ourselves, and chances are, it's the root for why we harm others.

So, at the heart of the Dharma is this non-harming instinct, this movement towards this. But is it ultimate? Shouldn't religion be about ultimate things that you can't really know for yourself, but you take it on faith because it comes from your scriptures, it comes from the Buddha, it comes from your teachers? "Now I know what's ultimate." People involved in religion like ultimate things. And partly it's because religious people tend to put a lot of themselves into the religious life. There's a kind of a commitment to something that's maybe bigger than themselves or something other. And for that level of a commitment, people really want to know that this is really the best, this is really good, this is ultimate.

In the earliest teachings of the Buddha, he explicitly was not interested in having ultimate truths. So now this professor is even more confused. The pursuit of ultimate truth was a detour. What the task was, he said, was to let go of clinging, let go of craving, let go of attachments. And to have ultimate truths for some people is just another attachment. It's another detour. It's a distraction from doing this deep work.

"But that's not, you know, just letting go of my attachments. I mean, that's kind of like, isn't that kind of like a small thing? How can that be so great and wonderful and ultimate?" And I don't get a lot of credit among my religious friends when I tell them, "Well, our ultimate is just letting go of clinging." That doesn't seem very good. So I think the best thing to do is to grant them that that is not that good. It's not that ultimate. And however, it might not be ultimate, it might be the greatest thing you can do with your life. However, it's the fundamental thing we should do in our life. It's the beginning of what we should do in our life. We should at least live a life of non-harming, at least find a way not to cause harm to ourselves and others. At least do that important work. Our world will be transformed if we did that. We will be transformed if we do that.

And once we learn, once we discover how to live without causing harm to self and other, once we learn to live without clinging and craving, once we have that level of liberation, well then, if you're still interested in ultimate truths, help yourself. Please, that's good. And maybe you have some wonderful ones that are inspiring and wonderful and poetic and fun to read about and listen to and be amazed by. Yes, but let's do this first thing.

And what not a few Buddhists have discovered is that doing the deep work, the inner work of becoming free in this way is pretty ultimate, pretty fantastic. The level of peace, the level of well-being, the level of safety that that provides is astounding. And on the way there, there starts to be an appreciation of how difficult and deep this work is. It's a task of a lifetime to really settle and find and come to what I would like to suggest is a really good fundamental place for all of us to be, all of us to begin everything from.

The Buddha said that if you cling and you crave, you can't really see what's really true. And so if you're in a religion and you're craving and clinging as part of it, it might obscure your ability to really understand even what your religion is talking about. And some people will say that once we—and Buddhism is not the only religion that talks about non-clinging, non-attachment—and a lot of the mystics in religions of all kinds... the beautiful teachings by a Catholic mystic named Meister Eckhart,[^3] who talked explicitly about the value of non-attachment, non-clinging in ways that would be completely at home in Buddhism. And it's not a surprise, because the way we can see clearly, see something beautiful here in this world, is so fantastic when we do this inner work.

A teaching in Mahayana Buddhism, in Zen Buddhism, goes something like this: "When your mind is pure, the world is pure." When the mind is pure, you see the world in a certain kind of purity. So this work on your own heart, your own mind, understanding it, seeing how it is, doing that work of really recognizing where the harming is, how we harm ourselves, and finding a way not to do it.

And for many of us, part of that work is to deal with all the lawyers in the mind. There are some really clever lawyers in there who will make a really good case that it's okay to harm sometimes. It's okay to harm other people. They deserve it. How else am I going to take care of myself? What other choice do we have? And sometimes the lawyers represent you. "Of course, I have to harm myself. I'm such a terrible person. I deserve it." So part of the task in this practice is to question the lawyers. But when the lawyers come, remember, don't harm them. Receive them as old friends. Receive them calmly, kindly. Listen to them, but don't believe them. Believe in non-harming.

And then finally, what I'd like to offer around this thing of believing. Many of us believe things that maybe we shouldn't be believing. Recently, I talked to someone who said, "I don't believe I'm capable of doing something that needs to be done. I don't think I'm capable. That's my belief." And instead of, when that occurs to you, change your language. Don't say, "This is what I believe." Say, "This is what I'm believing." And if you want to get extra credit, you say, "For right now, this is what I'm believing." The difference is huge. If you say, "I believe," it's like now it's a solid, truthful statement, like this is how it is. And who's going to find a way out of that? But if it's just an act of believing, "Right now, this is what I'm believing," then it's not so solid. It's like, well, it's just right now, it's just an act, and it's an activity of the mind. And the focus in Buddhism is not so much on belief, or at all on belief, but rather on the activity the mind is doing. And it turns out that when there's a belief, there's an activity of the mind happening, and that is called believing. And that puts the mirror back on mindfulness, back on what's the nature, what's the quality, the characteristic of that act, the act of believing.

"What do you believe?"
"Long ago, I believed. Now I act."

We're always acting. There's always action.

"What teachings do you rely on?"
"Long ago, I relied on teachings. Now I rely on what I know."

And what can you know? Maybe you don't know ultimate truths, but if you pay attention, you can know the actions that you're involved in. And if the action has to do with thinking, then you know, "Oh, I'm thinking something. I'm thinking about an ultimate truth. I'm thinking that I believe this is ultimately true." The action of thinking is happening. And we often overlook the action because we get caught up in what we're thinking about. We overlook the fact that I'm believing because we're caught in the belief. "This is what's true." "Oh, now I'm believing this. Now I'm reacting to this. Now I'm feeling this. Now I'm wanting this to happen." There's always an action. So, "What teachings do you rely on?" "I rely on what I know." And what you can know is you can know the activities we're involved in. That is a core, central activity that mindfulness brings attention to.

"Aren't you devoted to the Buddha?"
"Long ago, I was devoted to the Buddha. Now I am devoted to non-harming."

Once you start tracking the activities of the mind and speech and body, then you can start noticing, "Oh, this hurts. There's an ouch in this. There's harm in this. There's harm for me, and maybe there's harm for others." And then we can question, "Is this how I want to live my life? Is this the activity that I want to be part of?" Well, then the lawyer comes and says, "It has to be this way. There can't be any other way." Oh, that's a clever lawyer. But the lawyer is not the judge who has to decide. Don't let the lawyers decide.

"But what do you have faith in?"
"I don't have faith. I have confidence in non-harming action."

"What is your ultimate truth?"
"The end of doing any harm to myself or others."

"What is the good life now?"
"A life lived without any deliberate act of body, speech, and mind that harms self or others."

"Do you have no desires?"
"No, I do have desires. I desire a world committed to non-harming."

It's fine to have desires in Buddhism, but the desires have to be... when you're desiring, desire in a way that doesn't cause harm. Find a way to have desires that actually can be nourishing and supportive and helpful for you. Some desires are actually helpful, healing, beneficial, inspiring. And any desire that has to do with living a life of not causing harm, living a life that does the opposite, that lives with love and care and respect for self and others—desire them in ways that are inspiring, that don't cause more harm. Someone can have the desire to be non-harming and think, "God, I have to get on with it here. I'm such a lousy person. I have to desire non-harming and be the best non-harming person on my block." The very act of wanting to be non-harming is now harming you.

So we're always looking, in what way am I engaging? In what way am I acting here? In what way am I thinking here? In what way am I intending here? Is the very way in which I'm intending, wanting, thinking, does that inspire this inner beauty of non-harming? We're always tracking this, looking at it. And over time, it has phenomenal results. Over time, it creates so much inner well-being and peace and space and goodness that maybe you'll be the so-called Buddhist that goes into a town where there have never been any Buddhists, and the religious professor will come to you.

"What do you believe in?"
"I believe it's important to notice how I'm believing."

Now you understand why that's an important answer. "I believe it's important to study how I'm believing, so that I believe in a way that doesn't cause any harm, that does the opposite. It's nourishing, it's supporting, it's liberating."

So those are my thoughts for today. Now, what do the lawyers say? Or what questions or comments might you have?

### Q&A

**Questioner 1:** This topic was spot-on for something I'm struggling with right now. I realized that I am harming myself through perpetuating suffering over a loss I've experienced.

**Speaker:** So you harm yourself by perpetuating the suffering.

**Questioner 1:** Yes. And so, I realize it's coming from clinging to a wonderful friendship I had, and it's not wonderful at all anymore. And I keep clinging to what it was. The Buddha was so wonderful at giving us lists, but I don't find a list for how to let go. I think that's just the hardest thing for me.

**Speaker:** Oh, there's a really good list. It's a list that has only one item in it.

**Questioner 1:** Yeah, I need steps. I need 12 steps to learn to let go. It's repeatedly my biggest problem.

**Speaker:** Okay, well then I'll give you four steps. Be mindful of your body. Be mindful of your feelings. Be mindful of your mind states. And be mindful of the activities of your mind. The Four Foundations of Mindfulness. So when you have the particular suffering that you have, go through the checklist of those four. And if you're not really recently familiar with the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, really kind of study them a little bit. And then, you know, that's a checklist. It just takes a lot of familiarity, a lot of mindfulness, a lot of looking at it and seeing what's going on here. Not analytically, but what's the "inging," what are the activities that are happening now in the body, in the mind, in the heart. And you have to spend a lot of time just being mindful of it. And also remember that "mindfulness" is also not quite a good word. We're "mindfulness-ing." We're doing mindfulness. We're practicing the activity of mindfulness. And then the question is, how are you being mindful? Are you doing it holding on for dear life? Are you doing it with greed, with aversion to what's happening? Do the "mindfulness-ing" in a way that feels good.

**Questioner 1:** I must be missing something because I'm actually doing a practice so similar. I mean, it's almost dead on. My coach was taking me through it. I catch myself. I wake up almost every morning with these thoughts. So I catch myself, "Oh, I wish I had said that," or, "Oh, it hurts so much when she said this," or, "Oh my gosh, that was so wonderful when we were friends like that." It's possible. But then I stop, I look, I say, "Oh, I'm saying this," and then I rub my fingers together, I check in with my body, my breathing. Every damn morning it comes back.

**Speaker:** So, I don't know you that well in this regard, but I suspect that you're doing all this from the neck up. Do it once your belly is really relaxed. Find a way, good posture, really find your... let your belly be deeply relaxed, and then do the work. Do the practice.

**Questioner 1:** I will try that. From the bottom up rather than the top down. Yeah, I think you're right. I'm doing it as a mental construct. I'm going step one, step two, step three. Okay, that'll be weird. Thank you.

---

**Questioner 2:** Isn't having expectations of others always harming them and harming yourself? And if you have no expectations, then you are all alone.

**Speaker:** I think having an expectation when there's been an agreement is reasonable. You know, so if someone promises something and you agreed together, like, "This is what we're going to do," I think that's one of the functions of an agreement. Now we can expect that something will happen, we can trust something will happen in a particular way. And then if the agreement is broken, we feel kind of hurt. But if there has been no agreement between the people, then we have to be very, very careful about the expectation because then we're projecting something on the situation that other people haven't agreed to. We're bringing our values and putting them on other people.

Now, there might be implicit agreements we have in our society. You know, like when the traffic light is red, we don't drive through it. We have an expectation that that's how we all agree to drive, but you never asked the other driver, "You promise not to drive?" We have all kinds of sometimes implicit agreements. So I think that when there's an agreement, it's reasonable to have some expectation, and then people are accountable to the agreement. You can say, "I expected that. What happened? What was going on?" You have something you can talk about. But expectations on oneself and expectations on others are also a source of a lot of suffering. Other people suffer, we suffer. We have standards we hold ourselves to, we hold other people to standards that are much higher than they can actually live by. And it can be oppressive, it can be harmful to have expectations of self and others which are unreasonable. And so this is why this mindfulness, where we're looking at how... again, not the expectations are important to look at, but what's going on for you when you're expecting, when you're doing the action of expecting. What do you want? What are you attached to? What are you hoping for? What are you afraid of? This gives you enough to think about.

---

**Questioner 3:** What if it's a kind of complicated situation? I'm thinking of an example. Let's say I have a pond and I have some fish in it, and then there's an invasive species that now lives in the pond that's killing my fish. So if I don't harm that species of some sort, my fish will all die. Then what should I do in that case?

**Speaker:** First of all, I love it when people ask the question, "I have this problem, invasive fish, I don't want to kill them, but what can I do?" People that ask that question, I welcome so much. This is fantastic that they're asking, rather than immediately go get the poison to kill the fish. And then the question, well, let's think about it. Maybe let's do some research and find out what we can do. And maybe there's something that can be done. Maybe there are traps you can put in that can trap the fish and take them where they belong, which is maybe expensive, but maybe that's nicer than just killing them. So maybe there's something that can be done. Maybe your fish are really small and that's a really big fish, and if you take a big fishing net through the pond, you get all the bad fish on one side and all the small fish stay on the other side of the net. And then you can kind of... let's figure out what we can do. Now maybe that's a good way of living, and maybe they can just kind of share the pond together that way. Or maybe you realize the reason why the big fish are eating the small ones is because they're hungry, but they actually have a preferred diet where they came from. And so let's bring in the preferred diet, and they'll leave the small fish alone.

So I'm just making up ideas, but it's possible by thinking about it and exploring. But sometimes it takes a while. Sometimes just killing them seems like it takes care of it really quickly. But then because you killed them, your other fish now think, "Oh, killing is right," and so they start killing each other for the slightest little thing. They've learned that killing was possible in this pond. And you don't know the repercussions that killing has.

And then there's also... it could also be that the invasive species was coming because the person didn't read the news and didn't read that if you bring in this particular kind of feed, it has these fish eggs in it and you have to be really careful. "Oh, but it's so much work, who cares about doing that, and I don't believe it anyway." And so then there's no preventive work done. So if you have the equivalent today of a pond with fish in it, think ahead. Notice what's happening. Set up a situation so in the future there's not that problem. So if people who want to live a non-harming life, they also need to be proactive. They need to set the conditions now so that in 5, 10, 20, 50 years, there aren't any problems. To only look at the present moment is very myopic when it comes to living a life of non-harming. So does that give you some ideas? There was not an ultimate answer, but it's a beginning.

---

**Questioner 4:** So when I'm thinking about invasive fish in a fish pond, I'm thinking about Israel and Gaza. And I'm wondering... I don't know how to think about it, and I wonder if you have any suggestions.

**Speaker:** Yes. I mean, the talk today was partly a response to that without mentioning it explicitly. And one of the reasons not to mention it explicitly is... I'll tell you a story about Thich Nhat Hanh.[^4] Thich Nhat Hanh lived in Vietnam during the war between Northern Vietnam and Southern Vietnam. He lived right in the area where the conflict was most active, battles back and forth in fields nearby. And he was dedicated to doing it a different way, not fighting. He was dedicated to non-harming. And he had a whole group of monastics, women and men, who were out there trying to support everyone on both sides of the conflict and offer a different approach to it all. And because of that, neither side trusted him. Because he was supporting the Northern Vietnamese, trying to help them and maybe even offer medical care, the Southern Vietnamese didn't trust him, and vice versa.

And so the situation in Gaza and Israel is awful. There's so much pain. And to take the middle view, the middle way that really wants the best for both sides, is kind of difficult to say because one way or the other, people on either side get upset that you don't understand how terrible it is for us and how much we've been violated and how much we've been forgotten by the world, or all kinds of things. And so I didn't want to talk about it directly. And not talking about it is also very difficult because then you're ignoring, you know, and people say, "You're ignoring my people, I don't feel safe." But when there's both people who feel that way, then you know, it's a very difficult thing to be in that middle. So the middle for me is not being aloof or indifferent, but is having a heart that's really concerned for everyone involved and is dedicated to finding, the best we can, a way of non-harming. Without... I don't know... without maybe, giving the question earlier today, without projecting expectations on what people do. Thank you.
