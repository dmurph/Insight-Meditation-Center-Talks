So today, I want to talk about a topic which may or may not be popular, and that topic is Faith. Some people love this topic; for some people, just the word of it raises an alarm. I do hope that in the course of the talk, the talk will be inspiring something in you. There's a number of steps that we're going to go through. The first is going to be something that maybe isn't so popular, but is linguistic: what word are we talking about? What do we mean when we use the word faith?

The important aspect of this is that part of Buddhism, the engagement for people who don't speak Pali[^1] and didn't grow up with this ancient Buddhist language, part of as we try to understand this tradition, there's a part of it that we get to make for ourselves. We get to understand and construct the part of Buddhism that's really personal, to personalize the religion in some very deep and important way. And there's a part of it, if you want to be engaged in Buddhism, it's not something that is your personal opinion or whatever you'd like it to be. There is something which has some integrity to it, which is Buddhism. So what is it that you get to make up and personalize in some very important way, and what is it that you can't quite personalize and still call it Buddhism? That's part of the journey of this talk as we go into this word faith.

To begin with a story, before the Buddha was the Buddha, when he was Gotama[^2] seeking awakening and the end of suffering, he practiced with different teachers. He perfected what they had to teach, and they actually wanted him to be a teacher in their system. He said, "No, this is not it yet." But he made this very interesting statement. He said, "These teachers I have, they have a certain faith, and I have faith. So I think I can go off and do it by myself." But he wasn't enlightened yet. There was no Buddha in the world yet to have faith in, there were no Buddhist teachings to have faith in. He used the word faith for something he had. It wasn't a belief in something, but it was a confidence. Was it in himself? Was it in something that wasn't quite himself? What was it that he meant by the word faith?

The word he's using in Pali is Saddhā.[^3] In Sanskrit, some of you with an Indian background may know it more as Shraddha. How do we translate this word into English? Some translators do not use the word faith, often for good reason, and the most common one they use is "confidence." Sometimes people use the word "trust." Those are the three primary words. But the word "faith" in English has a wide, rich range of meanings, some of which have wonderfully evocative, emotional, heartfelt qualities that the word "confidence" doesn't have. Confidence, as important as it is, for most people doesn't necessarily evoke some deep feeling of heartfelt trust or something really inspiring in the heart.

The other word that's often associated with faith in English is "belief." Now, what's fascinating about the word belief is that in its history, it comes from the word "to love." "Lief" in Old English and in German meant "to love." Scholars of medieval religion say that there was no questioning whether you believed or didn't believe in God in 10th or 12th century Germany or France. It was just taken for granted. But when you said you "believed in God," what you were saying is you "love God." There's a different feeling there. This is where I put my love. So, to believe not as an act of just credence, like, "Okay, I have to accept these teachings as being true," that's not maybe what the original idea of belief is, but rather, "this is where I put my love." So if faith and belief are related, is there something about faith that means, "this is where I put my heartfelt feeling of value and appreciation and delight"?

We use the word faith in many fascinating ways in English. "Keep the faith" partly means keep the commitment, keep your appreciation of something, keep going with it. Being "faithful" to something means don't betray it. Being faithful in marriage: don't betray it, stay true to the commitment. It's more than having confidence. You lose something if you keep translating Saddhā as confidence; you lose a sense of love or commitment, a certain loyalty. "Fidelity" is related to the same Latin roots as faith, and it means a kind of loyalty.

The way that all these words have different meanings for every individual, different associations... there's an expression in English, "a person of faith." For me, that just makes me happy when I hear that phrase. For others of you, it probably frightens you. So it all depends on the associations we have. For me, a person of faith is someone who holds certain fundamental values of goodness. It is not about what they believe, but rather that they're ethical. A person of faith, I expect a certain high level of moral goodness in how they go through the world. I think of them as someone who's more gentle, not assertive, not domineering, with a kind of willingness to be of service from their love.

So what do these words mean for you? That's where you get to make it up. You get to take the ancient word Saddhā, a very important word in Buddhism, and decide for yourself what English word works for you, that inspires you, that's meaningful for you, that is useful for you to have. If translating it as "faith" is not useful for you, don't translate it that way. If these well-meaning Buddhist teachers use the word faith, just code-switch and say, "Okay, that person said faith, so I'm going to use confidence." The teachers who like to use "confidence" for Saddhā really want to emphasize practicing. You want to have confidence that this is something you can do. Just like learning any kind of skill, it helps to have confidence. Buddhist practice involves developing skills, and so emphasizing the confidence side means, "Okay, I can do it. I'm going to engage."

Some people like "trust." There are plenty of times in my Buddhist career where I prefer to translate Saddhā as trust. There was something profound that I really felt like I could rest in or rely on, that really would support me. One of the primary things that I trust fundamentally, that's come from doing this practice, is mindfulness itself. It's not a belief, but it's a capacity that I have, a way of being that I just trust more than anything else because it's proved reliable over and over again.

And then there's the word "belief." Now that you know that belief at least originally meant "to love," maybe you want to translate faith as something to do with love. Faith is where we put our heart. It's heartfelt, or what we're willing to put our heart in and let our heart rely on. In the ancient tradition, faith was more a quality of personality, of character, more than a faculty that we have or an action that we do. So again, it's pointing to something deeper than many of the ways we think about it. We think about having faith *in* something, but rather it is a faculty that we have that we can awaken. What is that? What would it be for you? This is a part of Buddhism you get to make up for yourself, personalizing the meaning of these words and how we play with them.

So, when the Buddha, before he awakened, said, "I have Saddhā," that gave him the trust, the faith, the confidence, the love to go off and practice. In another story the Buddha tells from before he was awakened, he talks about how he dealt with fear. He had fear. Isn't that nice to know? Some of you probably have occasional fear and anxiety, and so the Buddha did as well. He had to practice with his fear; that was something he had to contend with.

Many of the Buddhist practitioners in his time went off into the forest to practice alone. Some [monks?] came along to the Buddha and said, "Well, it's frightening to go into the forest and practice, isn't it? Isn't it too frightening to be able to practice? You can't get concentrated in the forest." The Buddha said, "Well, actually, before I was awakened, I went into the forest too and practiced. But before I did, I checked myself out to make sure that I was prepared for that." He said, "Do I have any sensual desire that's going to make it difficult to be in the forest alone?" Like if you're lusting after a person in the forest all the time, you're not going to get concentrated. "Do I have any sensual desire? No. Do I have any ill will, any resentments left over? No. Do I have any resistance? Do I have any ways in which I'm caught in my fear, frozen in my fear? No. Do I have any agitation or regrets? No. Do I have any doubt? No." Anybody who has these things would probably be afraid when they go into the forest.

Then he makes an interesting statement: "Do I have any alarm or terror?" He's not an alarmist. Some people get alarmed by all kinds of things. But he said, "No, I'm not an alarmist, and I don't get terrorized by things." What he means by that, I don't know, it's kind of interesting. So what he's doing is checking himself out, and maybe if he had those things, he realized, "I have to work through these first." So he'd go to a therapist if he was in modern America, who can be very helpful for some of these things when they're really difficult. But you work through it or come and start basic meditation practice, because that's a lot of what we're working through.

At some point, he was ready to go into the forest, and in fact, he was afraid. It's a delightful little description of his fear. "On especially auspicious nights, I dwelt in awe-inspiring, horrifying abodes, as orchard shrines, woodland shrines, and tree shrines. And while I dwelt there, a wild animal would come upon me, or a peacock would knock off a branch, or a wind would rustle the leaves." I remember sometimes backpacking in the Sierras [?] by myself, no one around for miles, dark in my little tent, and there were monsters walking, crunching the leaves around. What are these monsters doing around here? Crunch, crunch, snap. If I was awake and it was daytime, the rustling of the leaves would not do anything for me. But in the dark, there were times where I couldn't sleep.

But how he deals with his fear, practicing alone in the dark in these frightening places, was whatever posture he was in, he stayed in that posture and was mindful, present for that. Somehow, staying present for it, not giving into it, not running away, not collapsing around it, staying with it in a dignified way, somehow he worked through it. He doesn't go into the details here, but he was prepared. He was ready at this point in his life to sit or be really present for fear when it arose. But you saw he was prepared, right? So are we prepared for it?

That this was important is not a coincidence. That he checked himself out, saw what he had worked through and what he didn't have, is not a coincidence for what Buddhism is about—the part of Buddhism that you're not supposed to change. The part of Buddhism, if you want to be into Buddhism, you have to kind of accept as being very important. And now we come to the topic of faith, Saddhā, again. The emotional qualities the Buddha associates with faith give you a sense of what it's about: calmness, clarity, and confidence. So those are the associated terms. It's not to be a zealot; it's to be peaceful. It helps you be profoundly peaceful.

So what is it that does that? To reach this level of faith—and there are different levels of faith—but this level of faith that's really confident, now there's going to be a fidelity to it, a loyalty, a commitment to something which is more than a belief. Something, in a sense, that maybe is even more than the usual "me" that you identify with. Not transpersonal, exactly, but not necessarily personal either. Something that maybe is in you but which is not who you think you are. What could that be? To have faith in that, to have confidence in that? This is the core confidence that the Buddha is really pointing to, that it's possible for us to experience and grow in this practice.

This is going to be a little bit boring, so you're forewarned. But it's also going to be phenomenally important, and I hope by the time I finish this talk, this is going to inspire you to no end. So be patient with the boredom, but listen to this. Listen to it as if it's a guided meditation where the key words are pointing to something deep inside of you, a possibility, something that if you really could do this in a thorough way, would be transformative. You don't have to believe anything. There are no creeds to have faith in. And some of you are going to think this has nothing to do with religion. "I came to Buddhism, it's a religion, and this is like..." you fill in the blank. And some of this language, you're not going to like. So you're forewarned, this is the caution statement.

"There are these imperfections that defile the mind." Some of you don't like the word "defile," but remember, you get to make up parts of your Buddhism, and what you can make up, within a certain range, is how you translate these words into English. I wouldn't translate it as "defile," but this book does. Anyway: "There are these imperfections that defile the mind: covetousness and unrighteous greed is an imperfection that soils the mind. Ill will soils the mind. Anger soils the mind. Resentment, contempt, insolence, envy, avarice, deceit, fraud, obstinacy, rivalry, conceit, arrogance, vanity, and negligence are imperfections that defile the mind." What a list. Did you get bored? No? Exciting, edge of your seats?

Okay, so there's a list of 17 things that he says soil the mind. Now, imagine a world where humans didn't have this. Imagine really knowing and trusting someone you know who has none of this. Imagine what that would be like. Imagine if this was actually the common denominator of all religions, of all political parties, of all isms. "Let's not be covetous. Let's not have greed. Let's work through our ill will and our anger. Let's not have resentment and contempt. Let's find a way not to be insolent, envious, avaricious, deceitful, fraudulent, obstinate... rivalry, conceit, arrogance, vanity, negligence." Wow. What if that was the common denominator we all shared? Wouldn't it be a different world? I propose that there would be a revolutionary change in our societies if we all agreed, "Yes, we're not going to argue what you believe, we're not going to be opposed to what your political stance is, all those things, provided we all agree on this." Wow, wouldn't that be good?

So these are the things that soil the mind, the Buddha said. But then—and this is the exciting part of the boredom—"Knowing that covetousness and greed is an imperfection that soils the mind, a person abandons it. Knowing ill will, one abandons it." Knowing each of these 17 things, one abandons it. So that's pretty good. But then comes even the better part. Once it's been abandoned, then you have a mind, you have a heart in which those things are not present.

When a practitioner has known that covetousness and greed has been abandoned, when the practitioner knows ill will has been abandoned, anger... knows the absence of these things. Knows the absence of resentment and envy and hostility and rivalry and really knows that absence. But knowing is not an abstract, cognitive idea that it's gone. What's the heart experience? What's the embodied experience? What's the mind experience of not having that agitation, the contraction, the pressure of these kinds of forces when they're operating in us? What's that absence like? Wow, that is peaceful. That's settled. That's a relief.

I've known people who've had resentments for years and years. I've known people whose policy of how to live for decades is to be angry; they carried it with them the whole time. I've known people who for decades have had desire and greed be the driving force of their life. What a relief to finally have these kinds of powerful forces not operating. To know this possibility for oneself, to have experienced that kind of peace.

This is what provides an unshakable—this translator calls it "unwavering confidence." Some people translate it as "unshakable confidence" in that possibility. The literal meaning in Pali—again, because remember, you get to have some choice here in how you translate it—the Pali literally means "confidence based on knowing." So you know something now for yourself. It's not based on trusting this book or trusting me, but it's trusting what you've really experienced for yourself.

If you have that, then the Buddha says you can have real confidence in the Buddha, in the Dharma, in the Sangha—in Buddhism. Because what is Buddhism? What is the essence and the purpose of Buddhism? At the foundation, it's not about a belief, but rather about doing this: becoming free of these things that soil the mind. And whereas before I said it'd be great if this could be the common denominator of all religions, all isms, not only is it the common denominator of Buddhist teachings, it's the *purpose* of Buddhist teachings.

This is what's ultimate in Buddhism. It's not a glorious ultimate. It's not like you go to a block party and your neighbors say, "What is this Buddhism you're doing? What is the purpose of it?" and you pull out your list of 17 things. "Oh, the purpose is to be free of covetous greed, anger, envy..." and by the time you finish the 17, they've already gone off to someplace else, or they're feeling sorry for you because their ultimate is Cosmic Consciousness. Their ultimate is some grand, glorious, sexy kind of thing. Or even just something beautiful, like their ultimate is love. They listen to all this and say, "Well, okay, I guess it's okay for you, but what about love? What about compassion? What about beauty? What about great spiritual states?"

These *are* great spiritual states. These are beautiful states. These are the doors that open so that we can have love and compassion and care for each other. These are profound things. So we might not make an impression on our neighbors, but that's actually a good thing, because I think we don't want to hold Buddhism up as being too special. That's one of the ways of soiling the mind, thinking "it's really special." But let's not be too caught up in it, because this is what it's about.

So, to have faith in this possibility, this possibility of this kind of freedom, this kind of absence of these difficult, painful states of mind, and then to live in the world based on them... is this something we have faith in? Is it something we have confidence in? Is it something you want to trust? Is this something that you want to have fidelity to? You want to have loyalty to this? Is this something that has such great value that you're going to be committed to it and not give it up too lightly, too easily? You're not going to come along and finally decide, "Well, yes, this non-anger thing is good, but now I'm justified to be angry." Or, "Greed is good. Non-greed is pretty good, but this thing is so good, it's okay for me to have greed for this."

Fidelity, commitment to something that we know, we've discovered for ourselves. A feeling of being clean inside, a feeling of being cleansed of these things that soil us, that pressure us, that hurt us. That you feel the beauty of it and the relief of it, the goodness of it, the wonderfulness of it. To feel the value of this... "I'm not going to give this up easily." There are forces inside of me that want to give those up. There are still the forces of anger and greed and envy and all these things can be there, but I've experienced the absence of it, and I'm committed to it. I'm not going to give in easily to these other things. I'm not going to give myself up for them. I'm not going to lose myself in these things.

And how am I going to do that? Not give myself up, not lose myself to them? I'm going to practice. I have faith in this practice. I have faith in practicing. I might not be a good practitioner, but at least I have a practice. At least that's what I'm faithful to: to practice and try to stay close to this. This is what's important. And how do we make it so important that it becomes the most important thing in your life? This thing here, more important than your family, for example?

One way is to appreciate that with this as a foundation, this kind of freedom, your love and care for your family would be so much greater. All these things get in the way. So you can safely tell your family, "I have something that's more important than you," because hopefully, if you tell it to them the right way, they've understood that because of it, you actually have so much more love available than you ever could have had if these states had stayed in you. Isn't that nice? What a nice trade-off. "No, no, I want you to be angry and greedy because I want to be the most important person for you." No.

So in Buddhism, faith is important, or confidence, or trust. Fidelity is important, commitment is important. But you're asked to know what that is for yourself. It's some possibility and potential that you have. And I hope that you're inspired by that potential that you have. I hope that it gives you something that you really have a basis upon which to live, a foundation, a common denominator of how we want to live in this world. And if we do it, I propose that it's a revolutionary act. If we want a world that's going to be peaceful, nowadays when there's so much horrific war going on, if we want peace to begin with us, if peace is going to start with you, if you don't only expect other people to create world peace, but if it's going to start with you, this kind of teaching is pointing the way.

May each of us be free of covetousness, greed, ill will, anger, resentment, contempt, insolence, envy, avariciousness, deceit, fraud, obstinacy, rivalry, conceit, arrogance, vanity, and here it says negligence. I like to translate that word as carelessness.

So you get to make up part of Buddhism for yourself, but if it's Buddhist, there's a part you can't make up. And that's your heart's freedom. May you be free.

Thank you very much.
