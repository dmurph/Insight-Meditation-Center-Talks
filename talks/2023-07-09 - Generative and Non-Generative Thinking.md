Good morning, everyone. Thank you for coming. I think I'm still under the influence of the pandemic, appreciating when we come together more than I did before. It's nice to be sitting here and be together in community, so thank you for coming.

The topic I want to talk about is one that was inspired by the recent retreat I sat. I did a self-retreat for a month by myself, and one of the things that I found fascinating, among other things, was an investigation or attention to thinking itself. Rather than thinking that thinking is wrong or bad, I wanted to investigate it to see what was going on with thinking in some deeper way. One of the things that I've known for some time, at least in my mind, is that there are different levels of thinking, different kinds of thinking. It's not like all thinking is the same. So, to slow down and stop and take a look at the thinking we do, whether it's thinking in images or thinking in words, and start distinguishing the different categories and modes of thinking that we have is important, because some of the modes are not so good for us. Sometimes, because those predominate, for some people, thinking itself gets a negative reputation. In some circles, it's almost as if all thinking is bad. But thinking is an important part of meditation, and thinking can be generative. It can be useful, it can be supportive of meditation and supportive of life. And thinking can be deadening; it can be the opposite of supporting life. It undermines us. The unfortunate thing is that for not a few people in this modern world that we live in—and maybe the ancient world too—something can skew the way that we think, and we get preoccupied in thoughts which are debilitating and undermining. To be able to see and recognize that there are different modes of thinking is, for some people, a new idea, and it kind of opens the door to beginning to live a little differently and maybe exercise some degree of choice about how we think, what we think about, and just as importantly, some choice about how we relate to our thinking—the attitude we have about thinking when we're thinking.

So it's an important topic of mindfulness, and it can be explored in meditation, certainly, and it could be explored in daily life and in all kinds of situations. I've had a fair amount of interesting discoveries around thinking while driving because if I have the radio off or am not doing other things like talking to people, I find that I can drive safely—while actually, maybe more safely—if I'm kind of a little bit tracking my thinking rather than being lost in thoughts. Twice in the 30 years I've lived on the peninsula, I was driving on 280, that big highway nearby here, and missed my exit because I was thinking a lot about something. I was kind of absorbed. I think I was driving safe enough; I was tracking what was going on around me, but not well enough to know where I was and where I was supposed to get off. So that was a little bit of a wake-up call. Wow, you could do that. But I find that driving is an interesting place. When I go for walks, I like to hike a lot, and when I walk alone, that's an awesome, interesting time to explore this world of thinking and what's going on.

If we don't do that, for some of us, thinking takes over. It can operate on automatic pilot, and the thinking just churns away without any question and without any choice involved. It's like thinking has a mind of its own, and we better just kind of follow along. Some people are so strongly wedded to their thinking that it's almost like who they are as a person is their thinking self, is their thoughts. For some people, it's actually frightening to stop thinking because then they're not anybody. They're not telling themselves a story about who they are, having fantasies or conversations where they are a player in it, reassuring themselves—or not reassuring themselves, but still kind of making a self out of it. And that's one of the reasons why some people think a lot, because it's a way of shoring up some self-concept that has become important for feeling safe in the world, or feeling successful, or somehow compensating for how difficult this world is.

In the teachings of the Buddha, there are two modes of thinking. I mean, there's many modes, but at what I would call the top level of thinking, the more active thinking, there are two modes. One mode in the ancient language is called *papañca*[^1]. *Papañca* is sometimes translated into English as "proliferating thinking," so thinking that just proliferates and has a life of its own, just spreads and spins and creates universes of ideas and things. Sometimes I like to call that discursive thinking. With discursive thinking, you're giving yourself a discourse, or you're having a conversation with someone or with yourself. You're involved in commentary or living some kind of storytelling mind, a fantasy mind, planning the future. The future is completely unknown, so you get involved in planning. It's very active, and it's what some people might call mental constructs. We're constructing things and ideas, and some people spend an inordinate amount of time in this world of *papañca*, of discursive thinking, of the world of constructs.

The other, the Buddha doesn't call it this, but sometimes I like to think of it as deep thinking. So the first I would kind of like to think of as shallow thinking, and the other is deep. Sometimes I like calling it contemplative thinking. I don't know what associations you have with the word contemplative, but I have very warm feelings for it. It's a kind of deep, spiritual connection that we might feel, and from that comes a deeper kind of reflection about things.

The important distinction between these two, and this is one of the really important points I want to make today, is when we're looking and paying attention to how we're thinking, it is to discover what's the source of our thinking. From where does thinking come? The *papañca* thinking that we do, this discursive thinking, the Buddha likens to a puppeteer. A puppeteer is above the puppet show, high above, and has these long strings, and it's pulling over all the little puppets to get them to do things. So this is the thinking mind that's kind of up in the head, the control tower in the head, and it has all these tentacles, all these strings that go into our muscles, into our nerves, everywhere all over the body. If we're caught up in that world, all kinds of big and small muscles are being pulled. The shoulders go up, the forehead gets maybe crunched up, the jaw gets tight, the belly gets pulled in sometimes. It's fascinating if some of you maybe have done this in meditation: of being relatively calm and settled and content and minding your own business, and then your mind, the puppeteer, just has this like really big bang thought, and then the energy is there. You've been now ignited with anger and fury or fear, and all these things have happened in your body. "Oh, you know, how could that person have said that?" And it was 50 years ago, but how could they have said it? And the puppeteer has come back from vacation, you know, and suddenly it's pulling all these strings—emotional strings and muscular strings and postural strings. All kinds of things go into play, and some people live in that world. And to call it the *padura*[^2], to call it the puppeteer, means that it's not really who you are, even though it's the only you that you might know that you've been living your whole lifetime. But no, that's not who you are.

There's something different. The deep thinking, the contemplative thinking, the Buddha associates with something he calls the *Yoni*[^3]. And the *Yoni* in Pali, I think in Sanskrit as well, means "womb." I think it's meant to be a metaphor as opposed to literally the womb, but it's a wonderful kind of metaphor of a place that's generative, something in which something grows and develops and emerges, gestates. So rather than being a puppeteer that's pulling strings, it's something that is flowing, something that is evolving, something generative within that spreads out. It can feel very different. Some kind of wonderful creative thinking, or thinking that if you're kind of sometimes in love or something with some place or person or thing, and you're kind of in a reverie, thinking about it nicely, it has a very different source than this puppeteer—unless the love has a lot of desire in it, and then maybe it's back into the puppeteer mode, where we're all fear and worry and desires and ambition and all kinds of things. But this deeper wellspring within, you can feel how differently it's emerging and flowing upward and outward, filling us. And sometimes it's delicious. Thinking can be, if we're in this other mode of being. And that's where kind of wisdom can occur.

This *papañca* is the world of two things. It's the world often of clinging, grasping, attachment of some kind, where we're driven. There's a drivenness, there's a push, and that might be connected to fear, it might be connected to desires, it might be connected to anger, it might be connected to insecurity—all kinds of things that we would call attachment that is fueling it. Or it's fueled with what in Buddhism is called "selfing," where the part of who we are that's not necessarily who we are naturally, in a sense, but who we are as a construct—how we've learned to create an image, an idea, a role, a presentation, a persona that we want to present to the world.

I remember when I first came to Buddhism when I was about 20 or 21, I went to the Zen Center in San Francisco to visit a number of times. And it was a bit of a shock to be talking to some of the most senior practitioners there who had been practicing for a long time, because it turned out that I was kind of constantly playing the social game of presenting myself as I wanted people to see me. So it wasn't just a construct in my thinking mind, it was a construct in my behavior that I was trying to reinforce. And my friends, they kind of participated and probably were all doing it for each other and cooperating. But at the Zen Center, these people had meditated a lot. They didn't react. I didn't get any response. They weren't going to play that game. And so they were this mirror, and I loved it. It's one of the reasons I went back to live at the Zen Center. I felt so much that's where I wanted to live. I wanted to live in a place where I could see myself do these funny, odd things because I didn't feel there was much integrity in them. It wasn't coming from a deep place that I wanted to come from.

So there's often a lot of selfing, self-ideas. And if you spend some time looking at your *papañca*, your discursive thought, where your mind is mostly spinning stories and ideas and conversations, chances are relatively high that you're one of the main players in it, that you're not very far away. And it's probably fair to say that for most of us, if anybody was walking next to us repeating themselves as much as we're repeating ourselves in our thinking, we'd be begging them to stop. It might even be worse, you know, you'd yell at them like, "Please!" But we can have the same thoughts, repeat the same thing over and over again. It's amazing. At least, I don't know, I shouldn't speak for all of you. Maybe some of you are always brand new, creative thinkers for every thought you have. But why don't we get bored with it? And one of the reasons is we're the main character or an important character in it, and who we are is important. I don't want to take away the sense of importance, but sometimes that sense of importance, for maybe good historical or current reasons, is part of finding out how to be safe in the world, or how to be successful, or how to belong. And this discursive thinking has become the mode for doing it.

However, it can come along with a lot of emotions and moods and attitudes, like fear, anxiety, anger, hatred, despair, discouragement. It can come with strong ambition and a lot of conceit of all kinds. And so what it means is that if you're having those same thoughts over and over again, you're actually reinforcing that mood on yourself. The influence not necessarily of the thinking, but the influence of the attitude, the mood, the emotions that come along with it are constantly being registered, influencing and shaping who we are. And that's one of the big dangers of this discursive thinking: its emotional impact on us. As I think some psychologists have pointed out, something like a high percentage of people who are depressed are depressed because of the rumination, the same kind of thoughts over and over again. And so there's a whole form of therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy where they actually look at the nature of the thoughts and what you're thinking and help people to think in better ways that don't undermine their psychological health, maybe even their physical health.

So this discursive thinking is, many times, really not good for us, and it doesn't often do a lot of good if it's repetitive, driven over and over again. As I've said sometimes here, I used to do a lot of planning thoughts. I was anxious about what was going to happen, so I thought if I planned and thought about it... I didn't think, I think I just did it automatically. It wasn't deciding to do it. And then very, very slowly, it took a long time, it began to dawn on me that my ability to predict the future was dismal. I would do all this planning and thinking with an image of what it was going to be like in the future and be ready or something, and it was seldom that way. And after a long while, it dawned on me, "Gil, you're wasting a lot of time thinking and planning about things that never occur. They're always different than how you thought." And after a while, I kind of slowly began to give up this neurotic drive to plan and think out and make myself safe for something in the future because I was not being successful. And so I'm happier now. It's nicer not to always... I do still think ahead, I plan ahead. I think it's an important part of life, but not in that driven way that I had before.

In the Buddhist teachings, discursive thinking gives birth to what's called the five hindrances[^4]. These are the thoughts having to do with sensual desire or acquiring things, thoughts that have to do with hatred and ill will, thoughts that have to do with resistance and lethargy and giving up, thoughts that have to do with anxiety, regrets, restlessness, agitation, and thoughts that have to do with doubt or uncertainty, indecisiveness. "What should I do? I don't know what to do."

In contrast, this deep thinking, this thinking from the womb, gives birth to a whole different way of being in the world. In terms of thinking, one of the characteristics that Buddha gives for someone who has the ability to think from that source is they think about the welfare and well-being of themselves, of others, of both self and others, and of the whole world. So this way of thinking is about what's beneficial here, how do people thrive, what's good for people. But it's not just for oneself, because if it's self-focused, the chances are it belongs to the world of the puppeteer. But to have it be an integrative whole, where the thinking is inclusive of so much, that's what I kind of associate with the womb. The womb is the whole world for us. Everything becomes the place that something can be connected to and be what allows something generative to grow and develop and flow from within.

As we have opened up in this wide way, then we're not making sharp lines between me and you, me and others. That belongs to the puppeteer, that belongs to the constructing mind that's making a story and making an idea of who I am. When all the constructs become quieter and we have a chance to think from this deeper source, that deeper source is not driven by division. It's not driven by dividing the world between the good and the bad, the acceptable and the unacceptable, the right and the wrong, and the right people and the wrong people. That's not its orientation, because it's growing into this wholeness, like an embryo grows into wholeness in the womb. So we're still in this wonderful womb of our planet that's a whole, and we're still growing as adults. And that's a place where we don't divide in this kind of way. We still have a sense of others, so we have concern for them, but the concern is not divided. The way we desire the welfare of the world, the way we think about people, we're equally caring for ourselves as we are for others. And I love it that the Buddha says also "for self and others," because it's not just the individuals, it's also for the communities we're in, the paired relationship with friends and family, our larger connection to family, to community and neighborhoods and colleagues. That we, self and others, and the whole world is included. So that's a very different way of thinking than thinking from the hindrances, these other ways of thinking from attachment.

Also, this deep generative place that our thinking can come from is associated with mindfulness, with awareness. It's generative of a certain kind of attention here in the present moment, partly because it feels so nourishing. The feeling of nourishment that it tends to bring, or contentment or well-being, tends to awaken a kind of feeling of being connected to oneself where we're aware, we're connected. With discursive thinking, we tend to be disconnected from the wholeness of who we are. We're in this world of thoughts and constructs and fantasy, and we're divided from ourselves, sometimes alienated from ourselves because of that discursive world of thinking. So there's awareness that comes from it, there is clarity, we start seeing more clearly what's here. There is a kind of a wonderful generative energy, that vitality that can come. Rather than the thinking draining us and tiring us, it actually feels like it's self-generating and can perpetually go on for a long time. And there's joy, a sense of well-being. The Buddha associates it with tranquility, being calm. He associated it with being focused, to be able to be really here and focused and present for what's going on. And he associates it with a source for equanimity, being not reactive to what's going on. The discursive mind is the reactive mind.

I associate this *papañca*, this discursive mind... well, I think it's very important not to treat the discursive mind as any kind of enemy. It can cause a lot of problems, it could cause a lot of difficulty, and maybe it sounds a little bit negative, you know, it's attachment and self-conceit and all that. I think it's very important not to treat it as an enemy because in this womb-like approach, everything gets included. Everything has a place. We're concerned about the welfare of everything. So I associate the discursive thought as being surface thinking. And what I mean by that is it's associated with the muscles of our body, and that's where we have to operate when it's fight or flight. If there's danger, we have to... we're set up to fight or flight, or for some people to freeze. But that's in the muscles of our body, that they can activate it quickly and engage. And the muscles are, in my way of talking here, more the surface compared to this womb-like place which is deep into the organs, deep into our deeper nervous system, in our hearts maybe we would say in the West, rather than the womb. And it comes from a different source that's deeper inside.

But the fact that the discursive thought is associated with survival, it has an important role. And maybe sometimes that world of discursive thinking and what comes from it and the emotions connected to it has in fact helped some people actually to survive. Sometimes even fantasy and being lost in discourse, for some people, that's the only way they've gotten some relief and some escape from a horrendous kind of life that they're living. So we want to be very careful not to treat disrespectfully this world of discursive thinking. And this is where this ability to have some equanimity and some open awareness, some kindness, in order to envelop or hold or look at the discursive thought is so important. Because then it has a chance to relax. It's almost like that part of us, what it needs is to be seen by something that cares for it, that sees it with respect.

So when there's a lot of discursive thinking, you can maybe feel and look at, "Where's the source of this? Where's this coming from?" And maybe get a sense of this deeper source, maybe in certain emotions or feelings or attitudes, or maybe places in your body where it's coming from. And then ask yourself the question, "What would help settle this part of you? What would help this part of who you are feel reassured or to relax or to feel safer, to make room for a more integrative way of being in the world that includes this deeper possibility?" When we get underneath the musculature, maybe some people even call it the armor that's on the surface, we get to this deeper place that's softer, more sensitive, quieter, maybe even shyer. It's not going to show itself so easily unless we get quiet and calm. But allow that, give time for that to emerge and to meet the discursive part, and kind of be in conversation with each other, and kind of maybe go for a walk hand in hand or something, so that there's a different relationship to discursive thought than how we usually do it, which is maybe just giving into it and just letting it run.

So it's important not to let your mind have a mind of its own, where it's in charge and it just kind of is running you. There is a deeper source that maybe we don't call the mind; we call the heart or we call the womb or something that is very generative and really brings forth some of the most beautiful qualities of a human being. So how to relate to all this, how to look at it and realize that there may be a different way than how business has been going as usual for you. And maybe you can hang a sign someday saying, "Under New Management."

So I hope that this talk has offered you something, some new approach, a new idea that inspires you to take a good deep look at yourself and to question how business as usual is in your mind. And say, "Is this really the way to go? Is this really how it has to be? Even though it's been this way for 50 years, does this really have to be this way?"

There was actually more to what I wanted to say based on my retreat, so I'll just say a little snippet. Maybe when I come back in a few weeks, if I remember, I can talk about this other half. And that is that it was wonderful on this retreat, one of the wonderful things was that at some point it became fairly easy for me. I had the discursive thought operating at times, the thinking mind going, and I could just shut it off. I wasn't in control of how long it stayed off, but I could shut it off for a bit. And that was fascinating, to then see what forms of knowing and what forms of thinking emerge spontaneously, kind of almost like they weren't me, it was just like they were just arising without the discursive thought filling the room, filling the space. You've probably all been in a group of people where one person dominates and so no one else can speak. Maybe you can relate to that. Well, that's what's going on for you. The discursive one, the puppeteer, has been filling the room. And your mental space, your awareness space, is actually very expensive real estate, and you don't want to waste it on the discursive mind filling it. There are other ways of knowing, other ways of thinking. Give them a chance. And the discursive thoughts, well, they're nowhere that far away, so they'll get their turn. But it might be time for deeper voices, other voices, other ways of knowing to surface. So that was the other half of the talk, but maybe that's for another time.

I'm going to stop early, 10 minutes before the usual stopping. You're welcome to leave in a few minutes when I stop talking. I thank you for being here. Some people come here just to be quiet and not to be in community, and so I respect that a lot. Or you can just sit here quietly. But I would like to suggest, since we have tea today, is that you turn to one or two people near you and just say hello and maybe offer your name if you will, or just something simple you want to say. And maybe that's it, and then you can go. Or you can have a tiny conversation about what your thoughts are, what happened to you listening to these ideas. Is there anything useful here for you in it? But when you have this conversation with each other, be careful how much you talk. It's very easy once people start talking to not stop or feel like they have to say everything. Make your comments relatively short, don't tell long stories. If you can go back and forth, ping-pong kind of thing, I think that's really nice. And as you form your little groups of two or three, just have a little bit of mindfulness around you in case for someone near you it hasn't been easy to find someone because of the way people turned, and they're sitting there kind of alone. So you look around and invite them into your little group. And then I'll ring the bell in maybe about six or seven minutes. So some of you can sit silent, some people can go, and then afterwards we'll have tea. And then you've already broken the ice and met some people, maybe you want to stay and say hello to each other.
