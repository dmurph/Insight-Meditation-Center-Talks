Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Both to everyone who might be watching on YouTube, hello, and to all of you here. I've been away for a month or so, and it's nice to be back. I was away doing a month-long retreat in a new cabin up in the Sierras. I had one discourse with the Buddha that went through my mind, which I reviewed and used as inspiration, and I'd like to share that with you today.

There's a core teaching of the Buddha that's given in this discourse. It's not delivered by the Buddha himself in this context; he gave it, but a disciple repeats it within a story. The story is interesting, and the teaching is particularly powerful. It's said that this teaching was the genesis of Zen and Mahayana Buddhism, influencing the famous philosopher Nagarjuna.[^1] So, it's a very significant teaching. The fact that it's set in the wider context of a story is nice.

The story has to do with a monk named Channa.[^2] Channa had been a monk for what could be 45 years, and he was distraught for a number of reasons. For one, after 45 years of being a monk in the time of the Buddha, he still wasn't enlightened. He knew the teachings, but he had not *seen* the teachings. Just learning the teaching is one thing, but to see it for yourself in your direct experience—that's a whole other thing.

Not only had he not seen the teaching for himself, but he was also apparently a bit of a troubled man. Many of you have heard of him without knowing his name. If you've heard the story of the Buddha leaving the palace as a prince, he went with his charioteer out into the streets. He had been given a protected life but was somehow able to leave the palace compound. His charioteer took him out, and there he encountered what's called the Four Heavenly Messengers: he saw someone who was sick, someone who was old, someone who had died, and then he saw a monastic renunciant. He had never seen those before. It's kind of unusual in the world to have people not see sickness, old age, and death, though many people in the modern world, like the United States, don't see it very brightly, especially death. Things are put away. Coincidentally, the first time I ever saw a dead body in my life was when I was 11 years old in Nepal, which is where the Buddha was. I was out in the streets, and there was this young child wrapped in a blanket being carried to the river to be burned.

The Buddha was supposedly 29, and the charioteer's name was Channa. This is the man who became a monk. The story is that he was born around the same time as the Buddha, born of a servant in the palace. So, Channa and the Buddha probably grew up together as friends. To make the connection even more powerful, when the Buddha eventually escaped the palace to renounce his royalty and go from the Himalayan foothills down into the plains to begin his spiritual seeking, Channa took him on the first leg of that journey. He took him to the edges of the kingdom, where the Buddha said, "You can leave me here." He took off his royal garments and jewels and handed them to Channa, saying, "I don't need these anymore; they're yours." Channa was supposed to go back with them.

That was a momentous role for Channa, and it's said it was very meritorious to be the one who supported the Buddha in his renunciation. After the Buddha was enlightened, he came back to his hometown, and Channa then ordained as a monk. However, it seemed he had some problems; maybe he was a troubled person. He kept breaking the monastic rules and would deny it. At some point, it was bad enough that the Buddha said, "Okay, you have to go live by yourself for a while." But what he did was just go found another monastic community to live in, which was breaking the rule. The Buddha called him back, and they worked something out. But he was known to be obstinate, stubborn, and perhaps arrogant due to the special connection he had with the Buddha.

Apparently, his behavior as a monastic became so problematic that one of the last declarations the Buddha made before he died was about Channa. He said, "By the way, the man Channa, he is going to have the Brahma-danda,"[^3] the "divine punishment," which is considered one of the highest penalties a monastic can receive. It meant that no monastic in the order was supposed to talk to him anymore. He wasn't disrobed, but he was to be completely isolated. He must have done something pretty bad.

So, the Buddha died. Ananda,[^4] the Buddha's attendant who was also from the same town, had the job of telling Channa about this order. That seemed to be a wake-up call for him. He decided, "I better get serious about my practice." Maybe the Buddha knew that Channa needed a real poking to get serious after 45 years.

And that's what he did. The sutta,[^5] called the *Channa Sutta*, begins with Channa going around to the elder monks, waking them up early in the morning, and saying, "May the elders instruct me. May the elders teach me. May the elders provide me with a Dharma talk so I can see the Dhamma." He was finally ready. However, because of the Brahma-danda, the elder monks dismissed him. They did give him a little teaching, but it was the most rote, formulaic teaching of the time. You can almost feel them yelling at him.

They recited the teaching of the five aggregates: form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. I prefer to translate it as appearances, feelings, recognition, mental constructs, and cognitions. The elders told Channa, "Appearances are inconstant. Feelings are inconstant. Recognitions are inconstant. Mental constructs are inconstant. And cognitions are inconstant." Then they would add, "All those things are not-self," and close the door.

Channa became distraught. He thought to himself, "I know all this, but my mind is not leaping in inspiration. It doesn't become confident, settled, and resolved about the quieting of all my mental constructs, of giving up all my attachments, of ending my craving, of Nibbana—liberation." Not only did he not see it for himself, but the teaching didn't even inspire him. It's hard to understand how these teachings on the five aggregates can be so wonderful, but let me try to give you a feeling for it.

They say that **appearances** are inconstant. This means anything that appears at any of the five sense doors: sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile experiences. These are constantly shifting and changing. Throughout the day, you experience a whole series of different physical sensations. It's a little after 10 and I'm already hot. Soon, the air conditioner will turn on, and we'll have different sensations. This morning it was cool. It's all shifting. Knowing this can loosen the grip we have on how things are at any given moment.

This becomes more important with our **feelings**, which in the Buddhist context means the experience of pleasantness and unpleasantness. That also is shifting and changing. Now that I've brought up the fact that it's warm, maybe some of you are reminded of how unpleasant it is. Or maybe you find it pleasant. If I hadn't said it, you might have been so gripped by my teaching that you wouldn't have noticed. These feelings come and go. There's something very significant about tuning into the flow of sensations, which is quite freeing.

Partly, we don't live in that flow because we live in our **recognitions**, the third of the five aggregates. Recognitions have to do with how we identify something. It's innocent enough when you see a door and recognize it as a door. But we recognize things in ways that are often a problem. Racism is a recognition. You recognize people in a certain way, or through internalized racism, you recognize yourself in a certain way. When we see that our recognitions are contingent, a product of our own mind, and that they also come and go, we can be free. I can be walking down the street and recognize someone as a dangerous person. But if I'm mindful, I can see that thought being born and ask, "Is that really so?" I didn't have that thought before; it came out of my mind. It's a mind-creation. If I'm not mindful, the person and the danger meld together. But with mindfulness, I can give the person a second look. "Oh, the person just looks like my third-grade bully. Actually, they look quite sweet." And the recognition bubble pops.

The **constructs** and stories we make are related. To see how they come and go, how they are born, gives us a sense that they're not solid or fixed. And **cognitions** are in a similar regard, though they are more basic than recognitions.

To say this simplistically over and over again, as the Buddhist teachings sometimes do, can make the mind numb. That's probably what happened to Channa. They told him these things are impermanent and not-self. You don't make a self out of them. Are you the sensation of heat right now? No. Are you the unpleasantness of the heat? If you make yourself that, then who are you when it gets cool? Does your identity shift with every feeling? To see these five areas as impermanent and not-self is one of the things the early Buddhist tradition said was freeing.

Channa had enough of this. He was distraught and said, "I'm not inspired by any of this. Instead, what arises in me is anxiety and clinging. My mind is spinning." The poor guy was really troubled, and his fellow monks weren't talking to him. He thought, "For someone who sees the teachings, it does not occur to ask, 'Who then is myself? What is the self?'" That question, "Who am I?", is considered one of the great spiritual questions. But for the Buddhists, if you really see this life directly, you wouldn't ask that question.

He wondered, "Who can point the teachings out to me so I can see them?" Then he remembered Ananda, the Buddha's primary attendant, who was from the same town. "Ananda was praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his wise companions," he thought. "Venerable Ananda can point out the Dhamma so I can see it. I have a lot of love for venerable Ananda. Why don't I visit him?" It's very touching. This troubled man decides to seek out the person for whom he feels love.

He goes to Ananda and tells him the whole story. "May venerable Ananda instruct me," he pleads, "so I can see the teaching."

Ananda replied, "On this matter, I am certainly delighted with you, venerable Channa, that you have opened up and cut through your obstinacy." For 45 years, he was around the teachings but wouldn't really take them in. But now, he was finally willing. Ananda said, "Listen, venerable Channa, give ear. You can understand the Dhamma. You can understand the teachings."

Channa thought to himself excitedly, "Oh, it seems I am capable of understanding the Dhamma! If Ananda says so, it must be true." And a great rapture and delight sprung up in him. This is something very significant: to have someone else believe in you. Some people grow up without anyone who believes in them, and it creates a real barrier to learning and opening up. Maybe Channa, as the son of a servant, had a difficult life that shut him down. For someone like Ananda to say, "You can do this," went deep.

Then Ananda began the teaching. "I heard this in the very presence of the Buddha," he said, recounting a teaching given to another monk named Kaccāna Gotta.[^6] The monk had asked the Buddha, "What is Right View?" Right View in Buddhism is the way we see the world when we have the first glimpse of enlightenment. It's not just something you learn from a book; it's when your Dharma eye opens and you see in a new way.

The Buddha said, "This world, Kaccāna, for the most part, relies on the dyad of existence and non-existence. But when one sees with right wisdom the arising of the world as it comes to be, the thought of 'non-existence' doesn't occur. When one sees with right wisdom the cessation of the world, the thought of 'existence' doesn't occur."

The idea that things exist, and a particular thing that exists that's a big problem is *you*. Of course, you exist, but in the Buddhist worldview, you don't exist as a fixed, solid thing. There's no essential core that is you. And yet, you also don't *not* exist. This is an enigmatic quandary people struggle with. But if you can see a thought arise—for example, "that person is dangerous"—you see it was just born in that moment. It didn't exist before. It's temporary. You can't say it doesn't exist, but because you see it pass away, you see it didn't solidly exist. You don't say it exists, and you don't say it doesn't exist. What you say is that it's in process. It's inconstant, part of the flowing, shifting stream of living experience. The idea in Buddhism is to learn how to float and swim in this stream, as opposed to getting stuck in the river in winter when it's frozen over. We often get frozen around our ideas, concepts, feelings, and emotions.

The next teaching is what was very significant for me in my retreat. I'll paraphrase it to make it simple. "This world, for the most part, is attached. But in relationship to these attachments, if one does not cling to them with the idea 'this is who I am,' then one will have no doubt that the very Dukkha[^7]—the very suffering of the attachment—is just the arising of suffering, and when it disappears, it's just the disappearing of it."

It's one thing to be attached; it's another thing to put a second layer of attachment on top of that, where I'm identifying with it: "I *am* that attachment." I might really like ice cream on a hot day. That's ordinary enough. But then I get attached to the idea: "I *am* the ice cream eater. I am the ice cream liker." And I better let everyone know this is who I am. I'll prove it by buying sophisticated ice cream flavors to show I'm a special ice cream eater, not just an ordinary one. It becomes important to go to the artisan ice cream shop because that says something about who you are. It's one thing to like ice cream, but the layer of "selfing" that can go on top can be quite strong.

A common identification among Buddhists is clinging to the idea that we're not supposed to cling. We see that we're clinging, and now we say, "I'm a bad Buddhist." We've added a second layer of clinging. It's bad enough to cling to ice cream, but to then be a bad Buddhist because you do adds another layer.

If we don't identify with our clinging, if we don't say "I'm attached" but rather "there is attachment here," then there's a better chance to see that all it is is suffering. Dukkha is occurring. If you're not distracted by the story of "I am the great ice cream eater," you can stay close to the primary attachment and see that it hurts. Ouch. There's a clinging, a contraction, a distress. Any attachment we have involves stress. To see that stress, that Dukkha, just as it arrives, gives you the opportunity to stay in the stream and not freeze. "Oh, it's just suffering."

The Buddha, as quoted by Ananda, says, "'Everything exists' is one extreme. 'Everything does not exist' is the second extreme. Avoiding these two extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma through the middle." And the middle is that things arise and they pass away. That's how you find your way into the middle of the stream where everything flows.

So I sat in my retreat and was reminded of these teachings regularly. Right there, awareness arising. Don't make this the self. Don't make this into "me, myself, and mine." Let it be. Let it flow. Feel the suffering of it come, feel the suffering of it go. When we feel and see how the arisings and passings are suffering, it makes it a lot easier to want to let go.

The sutta ends with Channa telling Ananda, "Reverend Ananda, this is how it is to have care, to be cared for. This is how it is to have well-wishing, instruction, and teaching by the venerables who are our companions in the holy life." Having heard this teaching, the teaching has now been fully settled.

There's a humanity to this story about this troubled man and what it took for him to be open to hearing the teachings. And as he heard them, to feel cared for and loved, and then to understand. Now it's settled. Now he knows. Whether you understand the core teachings that are said to be the origin of much of Mahayana Buddhism or not, maybe at least you were struck by the humanity of care, love, and believing in each other. And maybe that's the way to be open and available to hear these teachings, and then maybe someday, to have a teaching settled.

Thank you very much. May you all be well.
