### Guided Meditation

So, good morning everyone, and good day for those who are on YouTube. As I just learned, this is live on YouTube as well. My name's Ying-Chen, and I'll be here this morning with you, meditating together. After about half an hour or so of sitting, I will offer a Dharma talk.

I want to see if any of you are brand new to meditation. I won't know on YouTube, but okay, we do have a couple of people who are new. So, I'm going to offer a guided meditation for today. For those who have been practicing for a long while, you can listen to your own inner guide. For those who are new, if it's helpful, you can follow some gentle guidance to practice along with me. How does that sound?

My invitation is to just gently settle into the space you're in. Maybe just take a few long, deep breaths as you settle into the space.

I'll begin with this word: pause. Just pausing. Momentarily, it's a process to pause right here. We just notice this body sitting. This pausing has an effect; it allows ourselves to become present. Momentarily becoming mindful of what's here and now. Maybe pausing deliberately, with an intention to become more and more present.

You may notice that our mind tumbles along with the momentum to think, to plan, to remember the past. Just be patient and persistent to pause and stay connected with what's here and now. Maybe a few long, deep breaths.

Mindfulness is present, noticing the sound and the silence in between.

When this pausing comes to an end, one may become more mindful and present. A felt sense of the body naturally arises. You may notice the body making contact with the floor, sitting here, the weight of the body settling down. You can rest your attention right where the contact of the body and the floor is. You may feel the hardness, firmness, and pressure of the body against the floor.

Let the body rest on the Earth. We don't have to do anything. Let gravity do its own thing. Sitting like a mountain: grounded, settled.

Open to receive the felt sense of the breath. Maybe the flow of the breath, the movements, the energizing quality of the breath. We notice the breath in a particular part of the body or the whole body breathing. Let the breath massage the body.

The movements of the breath naturally energize the body or soothe the body. A Chinese word, *qi*[^1], an energetic feel. Expand to receive the dancing sensations in the body. Some movements of the breath, or tinkling in some part of the body, pulsations, vibrations, a gentle sway in the torso. Feel a kind of aliveness right here with all its dancing sensations.

Letting go of ideas and stories, dropping into the felt sense by feeling and sensing this body and this heart and mind. Let the breath flow freely, breathing in from the space all around and breathing out into the space all around and within. Allow your awareness to become spacious, expansive. The sound can travel through, the breath can flow. Feeling and sensing what's here with a spacious awareness, so thought bubbles can float away and emotions can move.

You may feel the heart opens with the spacious awareness. Maybe the body can relax even further, softening and relaxing into the spacious awareness.

Know that if the mind has wandered away into thinking, planning, or storytelling, whenever we notice that, we have a choice. We can choose to pause again. We can choose to step out of the unconscious flow of our thinking mind and step into being present, here and now.

### Dharma Talk: Establishing Fearless Relationships with Fear

Good morning and welcome to IMC. If you need to move about and shift your posture or do some things to help the body, don't hesitate to do that. This is a good time to transition. I'm happy to be with you all; I feel just very delighted to be able to spend this morning with you.

The topic I brought with me, one part of it is fear. I feel a little something in me to just name that. But there is also a second part, and that is how to establish fearless relationships with fear. So don't panic. There are these two sides to today's topic.

The word "fear" itself may bring a wide range of emotions and reactivities or responses inside of us. But we can't deny that fear is a very potent emotion in our human lives. It arises from all kinds of aspects or dimensions of our lives. It can arise out of physical challenges—illness, aging, death. It can arise out of emotional responses to something—the loss of loved ones, loss of financial stability. All kinds of loss can evoke the emotional response. It can be a psychological kind of fear, maybe a sense of self, self-image, a sense of who we are gets challenged, and there can arise a fear of some different kinds.

Even in the spiritual dimension, fear can arise. For many people who practice in the Buddhist tradition, and maybe many other spiritual or religious traditions, there will come a point where there is a recognition that all kinds of things that we thought we had reliance on, we actually can't really rely on them because they're ever-changing. It feels like the rug gets pulled from under us, and that can be a terrifying kind of sense. So there can be a spiritual fear that arises even in this domain. It's quite pervasive.

And yet, how do we understand fear? How do we relate with this emotion? This is a big part of our Buddhist practice. And I want to say, there is a way that we can relate to this strong force within each of us wisely and compassionately, so that this can be a force that is transformative, rather than feeling like we're narrowed down or limited and getting stuck by it.

So I decided we'll talk about this in two dimensions. The first part of this talk will be to learn a little bit about fear and understand it. I looked it up, and the dictionary definition of fear is actually a pretty good one, so I thought I'm just going to start right there. The dictionary definition of fear is: "an unpleasant emotion caused by the belief, perception, imagination, recognition, or expectation of some kind of danger or threat which leads to pain." There's a lot in this definition right here. I was amazed when I read this.

Let's tease this apart a little bit. The first one is, "fear is an unpleasant emotion." I think we all know this. All of us have experienced some kind of fear or worry, and it's an unpleasant kind of emotion. It arises out of causes and conditions; it's not just something that randomly pops up. The cause and condition is this long list of keywords here: perception, belief, expectations, imaginations, and recognitions of some kind of danger that's there. This is fascinating. When I saw this word "imagination," I realized, wow, how many times are we afraid because we have a certain imagination about a kind of a threat? We're on an earthquake zone—IMC is on an earthquake fault. If we start imagining what might happen, we could be panicking right now. So many of our fears arise out of that.

I'd like to differentiate a little bit here, which is quite important in this definition: the difference between danger and fear. We can't avoid danger. By being human, we have a human body, mind, and heart, and there is danger in this world, like the potential danger of an earthquake right here. We can't deny danger; it exists. You know, there's a danger that if I didn't walk properly, I might break my leg getting off this platform. That's a possibility. But danger doesn't necessarily mean fear. A lot of times we mix these two things up. We think danger means fear, that you're going to immediately worry and panic. But that's not necessarily so.

There is a kind of primal, survival response that's built into this system in response to danger. Like, if a car comes in front of you, you jump out of the way. That's a primal instinct. It doesn't necessarily mean we're going to panic; we just know to get out of the way to be safe. But it is true that often fear can happen.

You all probably have heard a lot of stories from the great Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh[^2], who spoke about people sitting on a refugee boat to go across the ocean. It's dangerous, no doubt. But if one person is calm and peaceful, the whole boat can be saved. A whole boat of people might survive. But if everybody panicked, nobody might survive. It's possible in this situation that someone is calm.

I want to give a personal example. Some years ago, I was driving and merging onto an expressway from the right-hand side. I saw a Jeep coming towards me in the lane I was merging into. It was driving very fast, but it was very far away, so I thought, "Okay, they will see me. I will be able to merge. They can change a lane." I had just these few thoughts and I said, "Okay, I'm going to go." So I merged onto the express lane. As soon as I got onto the lane, I looked back in the rear-view mirror. This Jeep wasn't going to slow down or change lanes. The people in this Jeep were waving and shouting, and I just thought, "Wow, this is not stable. I'm not really sure what this Jeep is going to do." I felt the danger right there. My instinct was to pull off the lane completely, get to the shoulder, and I just stopped right there. Then the Jeep zoomed past me, the people still shouting and yelling.

And right at that moment, what came to me was, "May you be safe. May you know peace. May you know the deepest, deepest well-being." I kind of surprised myself. I was like, "Wow, okay." I didn't panic, and I didn't curse them. That just came spontaneously. I recognized that was a powerful learning moment for me, that it's not automatic that we would just become panicky or angry or even have rage. That doesn't have to be the case. That was a really powerful moment for me to recognize that was a possibility, a moment of the fruit of practice showing up. By recognizing that, I came to have so much trust and confidence in the practice. I know next time something like that happens, I might trip again because of habit forces, but it doesn't have to be the only way. Through the practice, some other possibility can become available to us.

But it is true, as you've probably noticed, that often even when we get out of the danger, fear can come immediately after. Why? This definition gives a pretty good explanation. We can begin to imagine what could have happened. Well, that is scary. Even though we're out of the danger, we're safe now, that imagination can happen. That belief can happen: "Wow, this could have been really bad." Building upon that imagination, we can now start panicking. We can begin to have fear.

The deep root in this process is that fear is a reactive emotional movement based on this set of imaginations, beliefs, and perceptions of something dangerous that may be there. The deep root of this is that in the present moment, we're not clearly seeing and knowing what is really happening here. We did not see that we're actually in a safe zone right now. We did not see, "Oh, this is my imagination at work," or "This is a kind of perception that's at work." And we also do not see, oftentimes, that the fear is present. It's just a form of an emotion that's present.

Often, fear doesn't stop at just this momentary movement of the emotion. We can become frozen, frustrated, angry, or depressed. It can get very contracted, and we may even do something harmful to ourselves and others. There is this whole sequence of reactivity that can happen that becomes, in fact, rather dangerous to ourselves and to others.

We're not alone in this department. This is a strong force now, and it was a strong force thousands of years ago. I was looking into the suttas in the Pāli Canon, and it was interesting. In our Buddhist tradition, most people know the three unwholesome roots: greed, hatred, and delusion. But in fact, if you look at the suttas, there is a whole set of suttas that talks about a list of four, with fear in it. So it's a strong force.

But I'm going to shift to talk about the possibility, through our practice, to begin to establish a more wholesome or skillful relationship with this form of emotion called fear. This is what I call "fearless relationships."

The first kind of relationship that's helpful to establish with fear is this word: befriending. Befriending fear. This is part of us being human. When we befriend something, we can learn about it, we can begin to understand it. When we have an aversive, push-away, get-rid-of, run-away kind of relationship, we can't know it. So the first step in this whole process of establishing skillful relationships is to befriend our fear. It's like if you have a terrified child. You don't want to just beat them up or try to make them happy. It doesn't happen like that. You give them a very kind, safe, open space for them to be, to feel that they can be themselves. Then they can soften, they can thaw in that field. The same thing is an analogy for being with our own fear.

There is a process to befriend fear. The first thing is to come to a conscious relationship with it. If we're flowing in this unconscious stream of reactivities, we don't even know that it existed in us. The first step is just to become aware, "Oh, this is present in me." That's the practice of mindful awareness.

The second step is to begin to feel and sense the texture of the fear, the form of the fear, and to get to know it. I use this word deliberately: feeling and sensing it. Because fear is a form of emotion, it doesn't necessarily speak English. Emotions are movements; they are energy forms in us that move through. Often we use our logical, conceptual mind to try to deal with emotions, and we find out it doesn't quite work. You can think of it as if you're going to a different country that speaks a different language. You don't just keep talking with them using your own language. You can be in that environment to observe them, to feel their body posture, their facial language, and how they move. You can get a sense of how they are.

Can we feel and sense into our emotions? Can we really listen, not necessarily using all of our logic and analysis to try to map it out? I was looking up the Chinese characters for fear. There are so many words in this domain, and almost all of them have the character of a "heart" in it. It's quite somatic: the heart quivers, or the heart feels constricted or tight. We can get to know fear through our somatic experience, through an embodied sense.

Once we befriend fear and we keep practicing this way, then we can begin to open ourselves to new kinds of relationships with this emotion. One of those really important relationships is to not be afraid of our fears. Fear tends to have a really bad reputation, so we almost automatically have a sense that it needs to go away. It doesn't work that way. For me, the turning point of my relationship with fear was when I recognized, "Oh, I don't have to be afraid of my own fear." Wow, that's liberating. You're allowed to have them, but you don't have to immediately make them go away or beat them up. When we're not afraid, emotions have a chance to move through us.

Befriending fear and becoming fearless of fear creates possibilities for us to then establish a wide range of wise relationships with fear. Sooner or later, we all know there is no one-size-fits-all way to be with this potent domain of our lives. We need to learn a wide range of skills and cultivate capacities to be able to relate to fear.

Sometimes, those emotions can be like a tornado; they're very overpowering. When it's very overwhelming, one thing to know is that it is a strong form of energy. We have a choice to redirect that strong energy in some other way. You can get physical—not to punch it away, but you can get moving. Go for a rigorous hike, do some exercise or movements. Being in nature sometimes allows us to shift that energy. It's not helpful when that kind of strong reactive energy is doing its thing that we just get stuck with it. Know that there are other options. In Chinese martial arts, there are forms of Qigong that, when you're moving with certain movements, release certain emotions. This is a skill, not some kind of escape.

In other cultural backgrounds, when faced with powerful emotional forces, they chant. They come to a temple and chant out loud. Some people take refuge and just come and bow to the Buddha. It can be a way to shift our orientation. For myself, in strong moments, I don't know what else I would do. I'll just come and really bow. I bow a lot. And when I finish, I feel something opens up in me, or something that was really bothering me isn't there anymore. I don't have to solve it.

Then there are other times when you feel you're resourced enough, you have the inner capacity to be with the fear just as it is. Then you have a choice to say, "Oh yeah, I'm just going to be here and feel it and see how it comes and how it goes." There is a sutta in the *Majjhima Nikāya*[^3] called "Fear and Dread," talking about the Buddha meeting his own fear before he was awakened. He lived in the wilderness, and fears would come. He said, "I've developed a lot of inner capacities to be with fear, so I'm going to be with this." He used very specific language. He said, "When I'm walking, if the fear arises, I'm not going to change my posture. I'm just going to walk and be with the fear until it goes away. If the fear comes when I was sitting, I'm not going to change my posture. I'm just going to sit and be with the fear until it goes away."

What is this pointing to? He did not say, "I'm going to do something different to get rid of this or fix it up." The Buddha had a deep understanding that fear is a movement that comes and goes, and he had the capacity to just be with it without doing anything different, not even changing his posture. The system has its own way to dissolve and fade away, as long as we are willing to be with it.

The last piece I'll talk about today is that as we cultivate wise relationships with fear, we'll come to know that this is a gradual training. There will be a lot of times that we get caught up or get stuck. But there is a way to cultivate a whole set of inner capacities, resources, and skills to become wiser and more compassionate with fear. I'll name a few.

First is to develop *Sīla*[^4], ethical conduct. So many of our own worries and fears have to do with having done something that can cause a sense of concern for ourselves. When we know that we live in this world not harming—not killing, taking, or lying—our heart and mind are at ease, and a whole host of fears and worries will just not come.

The second one is to develop *Samādhi*[^5]: a collected, settled, unified, composed capacity. *Samādhi* is a very beautiful inner resource. Sometimes when we rest in this peaceful, quiet abiding, we allow things to move through us without being shaken by it. *Samādhi* is also a very healing place. A lot of physical and emotional things can heal in this space, and we don't have to do anything.

Third one is to develop *Paññā*[^6], which is wisdom. We spoke a little bit about developing wise relationships. Some of the deeper insights into the nature of our own being and our lives, when they become available to us in our own lived experience, allow us to become wise with many things, not just fear. For example, one of the key insights that arises through the cultivation of wisdom is *anicca*[^7], impermanence. When we know that fear is impermanent, that emotions are impermanent, and we know that deeply within ourselves, then we can begin to have a different relationship with it.

Next, developing the *Brahma-vihāras*[^8]: loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity. For me, that example I used of merging onto the expressway is an example of the *Mettā*[^9] practice bearing fruit in that moment. The story about the *Mettā* practice came about because monks got haunted by tree spirits. The Buddha taught them the loving-kindness practice, and they became fearless.

The last one, but not the least, is *Kalyāṇa-mittatā*[^10], spiritual friendship. It's so good we don't have to do this alone. We can practice this together. In this room full of people, and all the people on YouTube, if we're in a dangerous situation right now together and there's one person who can express peace, wow, that gives everybody a possibility. It doesn't mean that we have to be like that all the time, but if one of us in one situation has the capacity to show up with calm and ease and love, that's good enough. We don't have to do this alone. We're always being affected by each other, so allow that to uplift us, and to allow our own practice to maybe affect people all around.

I'm going to end with this note, by just appreciating us practicing together and exploring the Dharma together. May this benefit all beings everywhere.
