Warm greetings for our meditation time together. As I sit down to be here with you all, I'm thinking about two things: sacred presence—that which is present that feels deeply respect-worthy, inspiring, and meaningful—and sacred absence—the absence which is special, respect-worthy, and inspiring.

In this practice, there's a very important role for what I call today "sacred absence." To recognize the absence of clinging, attachment, hate, and preoccupation, and to recognize that absence as special, respect-worthy, and inspiring, it really helps open up this path of meditation.

With that sacred absence, the way that we are aware of what is present can have a sacred quality. Maybe not exactly because what we're attending to is sacred in some way, but the way that we're present for it—our sacred presence, our attention—has qualities that are sacred and special and not to be overlooked. There's always something here as we meditate which is absent. If you go back over your recent life, there have probably been things that you've been caught up in, reacting to, consumed with, driven by, or troubled by. Those troubles and those preoccupations may have faded away and are not here anymore, and it's possible to somehow be aware of their absence.

In that absence, there is more room for awareness, for attention. In that absence, we can receive more fully the experience of breathing. In that absence, we can connect more fully to breathing. Even in the much shorter term, if you're thinking about something in meditation and you're able to let go of it, there's the absence of that thinking. There might be the absence of the drive to think, or the desire, or the resentment, or whatever it was that was inspiring the thinking. To start recognizing the absence is a very important part of the deeper dimensions of this Ānāpānasati.[^1]

Then, it's not just about recognizing the absence, but recognizing it as an opportunity to bring a sacred awareness, a greater awareness. For the purpose of this meditation, for our breathing, we are simply aware and committed to breathing in and breathing out with awareness.

So, assume a meditation posture and close your eyes.

Here we are. There are a lot of things absent just by choosing to meditate. For the time being, there is the absence of the busyness of the day or the concerns about things we have to do. Physically, those things are not here now in our body, working on them. Maybe some other concerns that you have for the day you can put up on a shelf and put aside for now. Let them be absent, because they'll be picked up later.

To help let go of things and to be here, take a few long, slow, deep breaths. Maybe three-quarters full as you breathe in, and four-fifths emptying the lungs as you exhale. As you exhale, relax the body, the whole frame.

Letting your breathing return to normal, relax some more on the exhale. Not only feel the release of tension and holding, but appreciate the absence of that holding. Soften the belly. Perhaps you can soften your chest. Relax and soften your shoulders. Calm the muscles of your face. Cool down the agitation associated with thinking. Calm the thinking mind.

Appreciate absence, not so much that you have to think about what is absent, but maybe there's some way you could intuit the space of absence, the freed-up time, the freedom from thinking, the freedom of attention that's not preoccupied with the things that you have been preoccupied with. Here, allow this absence to become fuller by letting go of thoughts and ideas. It is an absence which is related to the simplicity of this moment, just here now.

In the sacred absence, you make room for your body's breathing, allowing, in a sense, the experience of breathing to fill the space of awareness. A sacred absence allows for a sacred presence, a sacred attention. When you find yourself thinking and you let go of it, appreciate whatever absence of thinking that then follows, and allow the breathing into that absence. So, breathing begins to fill more and more of your field of awareness, as if awareness fills the universe with just breathing.

Keep filling the absence with your breathing, your body's experience of breathing, so that this sacred absence is not filled with something else—not filled with thinking and wanting and fantasy.

Whatever you're caught up in and thinking about, beyond the edges of it is also sacred absence. Let go of your thoughts and preoccupations, your tensions, your holdings. Let go into the great absence. Fill that absence with the experience of breathing, allowing yourself to become very simple and quiet, just breathing.

And then, as we come to the end of the sitting, one form of sacred absence is to make the heart as wide as the world. Make lots of space in your heart, in your care, in your love, and in your goodwill, so there's a place inside of you for all beings. Clear the space within so that there's room for you to consider, relate to, and hold in your care others. For them to fill the space of your heart means to be very simple, allowing them to be as they are.

Maybe there is a sacred presence in that everyone is respect-worthy. Everyone, in some way, independent of how they're behaving, has something beautiful and inspiring deep inside, even if it's just a seed that's waiting to germinate. It is the sacred absence within you that allows you to receive and be present in a fuller, caring way for others.

You don't have to say these words, but maybe feel a care and a goodwill that these words express or touch on:

May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
May all beings be free.

May we live caring for the welfare and happiness of those around us. May this meditation practice provide inspiration and ability to walk through the world with care and goodwill.

May all beings be well.
