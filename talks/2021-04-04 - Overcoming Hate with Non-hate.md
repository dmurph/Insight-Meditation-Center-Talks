Warm greetings to all of you as I begin this talk.

There is a renowned verse from the Dhammapada[^1], an ancient anthology of Buddhist poetry, and it goes something like this:

> Hate is not overcome by hate, but by love alone is hate overcome. This is an ancient truth.

So, hate is not overcome by hate; by love alone is it overcome. It's possible that translating the ancient word as 'love' doesn't really capture the full richness of this verse, and I'll talk about that a little later. But I want to evoke this very well-known verse. It's really a central idea in Buddhism that we cannot pacify hate by adding more hate to the fire.

Hate is considered to be a fire that burns the one who's hating, that harms the one who's hating. So to respond to hate with hate means that there are now two people who are burning and suffering, who are wounding each other and wounding themselves.

This is such an important topic in the climate of the world. Really, I don't know if there's more or less hatred in the world than there's ever been before, but we're certainly becoming acutely aware of it here in the United States. Perhaps we're coming into an era in this country where there is the possibility of beginning to recognize the tremendous harm that hate has—harm that maybe was difficult to see before when the hate was expressed so violently that people were mostly spending their time protecting themselves from lynchings, riots, and all kinds of things. Hate was certainly present back then, but maybe it was not what was being addressed directly. But now we come to a time where there's a real, heightened sensitivity to what hatred looks like, how hatred speaks, and how it spreads as a kind of poison to our society.

I speak about this in the wake of the rising hate crimes against Asian Americans. Here in California, just a month ago, there was an arson and vandalism of an Asian Buddhist temple in Los Angeles—a Japanese Buddhist temple of the Pure Land[^2] tradition of Buddhism, a very peaceful, peace-loving form of Buddhism. The temple was partly destroyed, not dramatically, but enough to be quite disturbing.

This is a tradition of Buddhism that has been in this country for well over 100 years. It's possible that members of their temple, or at least of that form of Buddhism, have been here in the United States for six, seven, it's possible even eight generations by now. To be the recipients of hate, as if they don't belong in this country, is quite painful for all of us in this family that we hope to be in this country.

In some of these images we've seen elderly Asian Americans being attacked on the streets, right here in San Francisco for one. It's not like this kind of violence happens 'over there'; it's close in. It didn't start then, but it certainly raised people's worry a year ago when hateful things started to be said to people of Asian descent, especially Chinese descent, here locally on the Peninsula because of the coronavirus, and the spreading of animosity towards people of any kind of Asian descent because of a virus. The ease in which sometimes people hate is part of the issue here in this country.

Certainly, there's a need to stand in solidarity with the people who are the recipients of hate, and certainly to send solidarity with the Asian Americans who are struggling with this, with fear and worry about what it means to be out in public, even, or out in public at night. We know what's coming. And to offer our protection and to create places of sanctuary where it feels safe to come, and not just welcome to come, but feeling like it's home, like they belong. It's a little bit hard here at IMC, maybe teaching here all alone this last year, but I want this place to be a home for all people, and for everyone to come here to feel like they belong. And not just welcome, not just belonging, but to feel like it's their place where they can really engage fully and bring themselves completely here.

Certainly, I'm concerned for the membership of IMC that are Asian American, the membership of IMC that are Black, and all the people who have been the recipients of hate crimes here in the United States.

The word "hate crime" is an interesting term because the definition of hate in this regard is very different than some of the other meanings of hate. We use the word hate when people say that they hate spinach; it's a very different connotation, a very different meaning of the word than when we say we hate an ethnic group. I think the highest number of hate crimes in the United States is against African-Americans, and one of the other really high numbers is against LGBTQ people.

One distinction some people make between anger and hate, as in a hate crime, is that anger is for a particular behavior, a particular event, a particular situation. Whereas racial hate, or gender hate, or ethnic hate is hate towards a whole category of the person, not the behavior of the person, what they say or do, but the whole being of the person, and their family, and their community. So it's not just a singular emotion, but it's an attitude, a disposition, a way of seeing. It's an interpretation that's overlaid on the totality of who a person is.

That's why hate crimes and expressions of this kind of ethnic and category crime are so total, why it's so difficult for people and so painful. It’s because it's a diminishment, a contempt of who they are as a human being. And to have that repeatedly, to be the recipient of the idea that you as a human being are somehow worthy of my hate, is quite difficult. And then to know that that's a lingering disposition, a lingering attitude that stays, means that it's not just a mistake of the moment or an incident of passion in the moment, but it's something that stays and will continue.

To be the recipient or the victim of hate crimes, it's not just individuals who suffer, but also the families and the community, because it's known that it's in some ways related to all of them together. So it's really a tear in the fabric of society. It's a rupture in our ability to be together cooperatively, harmoniously, as fellow citizens, fellow companions in our humanity. It's also a kind of diminishment of people's humanity.

This is one of the great tasks, I think, of our society and for ourselves in our times: to learn how to see the humanity of other people and how to share our humanity with other people.

I saw an interview recently between an imam, the religious leader of a mosque, and a neighbor of the mosque. The man, who had been high on drugs, heard about some violence—I think it was the Paris shooting massacre where all these people died—by some ISIS followers. He came home high on cocaine and was just angry at Muslims. His idea, he said, was that he had been listening to a lot of social media, and so he thought all Muslims were somehow violent and terrorists and terrible people. So he shot up the building next door, the mosque. No one was hurt, but still, he shot at it.

He was arrested and went to jail for what he did. He apologized for what he did, and I think when he was no longer high, he understood the huge mistake he had made. When he apologized, the people in the mosque, the religious leaders of the mosque, forgave him and apparently brought him food and little gifts in prison. When he was released, because he lived next door, they invited him over to the mosque. They were able to tell him a little bit about what their form of Islam was, and he was shocked. He found these people to be fantastic, wonderful, peace-loving people who had forgiven him. Then he brought his friends over to see them, and they were all kind of discovering the humanity of each other, sharing each other's humanity, getting to know each other. This is not so easy, not possible, when there's hate. Not possible when there's that categorical idea that someone is somehow contemptible.

So how do we respond to hate as individuals in society? From a Buddhist point of view, we don't respond with more hate. It's hard to avoid doing it; it's hard not to be upset with them, those people who are doing it. Of course, we should take a strong stand against the acts of violence, against these acts of this level of hate, and hopefully stand up and help protect our fellow humans who are struggling with this kind of situation. It affects all of us.

But we shouldn't hate. In this Dhammapada verse, it says hate is not overcome by hate. A common translation is "by love alone is hate overcome," but the actual language of the original line literally says, "by non-hate is hate overcome."[^3] Non-hate is a larger category; it points to a wider range of responses than love. Love may be too hard, too difficult to draw up, to expect we're always supposed to be loving. And maybe it's not even appropriate as the first response in situations of hate.

And so the question is, what does non-hate mean? Most literally, it means not to hate. The idea of loving, I think, is a great one, and the motivation to love can arise out of deep meditation practice. In meditation practice, we let go, we quiet all the fevers of greed, hate, and delusion,[^4] we settle and discover a deep level of peace and well-being. Within a settled, peaceful, contented, reassured heart, we discover that there is a way of living, a way of being that becomes one of the most precious things. There can be a feeling of kindness, love, friendliness, and compassion that radiates from within. This feels like home. This has integrity. This is the place of value, of how to live this life. And then to feel a commitment that this is how I want to be.

So what can exist, rather than being loving, is the wish to be loving. We can't always love, but maybe we can always have the aspiration to love. And sometimes that aspiration to love means that the best we can do today is not to give in to our hate, our hostility. Maybe not giving in to hate, maybe the wish to love commits us to a sacred pause, to hold in check any movement we have to hate. We hold in check our tongue; we don't speak words of hostility. We hold our hands in check to not express any physical expressions of hostility. This learning to hold ourselves back because we want to love is not a kind of repression, but rather it's a kind of expression of something that's deeper that wants to come out, something deeper that's saying, "Wait, hold it. There's something more important here. Don't lose yourself. Don't give in to something which adds to fragmentation, alienation. Don't give in to something that is going to burn yourself."

Some of the dramatic images and metaphors for hate in Buddhism are that of a poisonous snake which is biting itself, or that of a fire that is burning itself when it burns. So the fire of hate burns the person who's hating. The poison of hate poisons the person who hates.

One of the dynamics of hate is that sometimes hate is a person's response to their own pain, their own hurt. It's often said that hurt can evoke hate, a kind of blaming others and trying to avoid the pain we feel ourselves by attacking other people and blaming other people, and turning the attention outward. So hurt can evoke hate, but then hate in return evokes hurt. And there you see there comes a vicious cycle. One leads to the other and round and round it gets stronger and stronger.

Hate evokes alienation, and alienation is a condition that promotes more hate. When we end up hating, we're separating ourselves from the humanity of other people, and then we're more alone, unless we then find companionship in other people of hate. We think we're connected then by the mutual cause of what we're hating, but it's not really a very deep connection; it's a shallow connection. To get somehow supported or feel enlivened by hate is a kind of self-alienation. And the more we're alienated from others and alienated from ourselves, the more that drives further hate. Hate brings alienation, and alienation promotes even more hate.

In Buddhist ideas, hate is a form of bondage. To freely do the wishes of our jailers is not real freedom. So to feel the freedom to express the hate and feel it's wonderful to express it freely is really doing the work of our jailers. They're just enslaving us or jailing us more and more in bondage. People who are hating are in fact caught and diminishing themselves and jailing themselves in these very strong feelings.

To find freedom is to find freedom from hate, to find the ability to allow something that's deeper than hate to come forth and move through us. And so for those of us who are practitioners, one of the great possibilities for us is not to diminish ourselves because we might feel hate, or we might feel animosity, or we might feel we have prejudice and bias, but rather to turn the light of awareness on that. To really be honest about that, learn to see it and recognize it in whatever form it takes—our anger, hostility, even to anything. To keep turning back 180 degrees away from the object of our hostility, our prejudice, our bias, to what it's like for us to have the bias, the prejudice, the hostility, or even the intense hatred that occasionally can exist. And really be honest about it and see it.

If we want to love ourselves, then we want to have the sacred pause and don't give into it, but look at it deeper and deeper and deeper. What's going on here? And then to find and bring with that the awareness that's calming, the awareness that is peace, peacemaking. The awareness is not hating or in conflict; it is non-contentious awareness. So we can start relaxing and settling the fires, relaxing the hurt, the alienation, relaxing the way in which we recoil from pain. Feel our own pain deeper and deeper until we find where the healing is, where there is peace, where there's wholeness, maybe where there is love.

We discover that when we respond to hate in the world with non-hate, maybe it takes the form of generosity, sending meals to someone in prison who hated us. Maybe it takes the form of forgiveness. The imam who was talking about forgiving the man who shot at their mosque said it made sense to forgive him because he had apologized. To discover the ability to forgive, to discover the ability to be friendly—we don't have to love someone to be friendly. And in all these expressions, maybe we do discover how to bring more love into the world, how we bring more of a peaceful, settling, pacifying presence into this world to benefit this world that's so challenging.

So I think one of the great tasks these days in the United States, and perhaps many countries in the world, one of the great, noble, important tasks is for us to stand in solidarity with everyone who is a recipient of hate and hate crimes: the Black people in the United States, the indigenous people, the Hispanics, the LGBTQ, the Asian Americans, and the list goes on and on. But also to really, more than just stand in solidarity and support, to be actively involved in making this world a better place and a safer place for all. And to understand as deeply as we can the roots of hate in ourselves, how this works, and to learn to develop the strength and the courage and the confidence to always wish, always want to be loving.

It doesn't mean you have to be loving; it's a difficult task. But we can always want to do it. And in wanting to do it, maybe we pause—a sacred pause—to avoid causing more harm, and we at least don't actively express our hostility to anyone. And maybe then, slowly, we can begin learning how really to meet the challenges of this world with expressions and ways of being and loving and caring and standing up and speaking up in ways that are going to heal the great divides of our society.

Let's discover the common humanity of all of us, so that we don't live fractured, but we live together as a community, a family, a society that cares for each other, that all of us care for everyone we encounter.

Thank you.
