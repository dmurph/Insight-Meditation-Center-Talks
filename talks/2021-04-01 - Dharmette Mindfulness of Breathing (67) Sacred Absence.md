So, we're continuing now with the last of the 16 steps of mindfulness of breathing, and we're coming now to the 15th step. The Pali word that represents it is *Niroda*.[^1] In the 14th step, the Pali word is *Virāga*.[^2] *Niroda* is spelled n-i-r-o-d-h-a.

Sometimes it's nice to just use the Pali words because, in the original context in India, these words have really rich connotations. In fact, *Virāga* and *Niroda* are sometimes listed almost as synonyms for liberation itself. They have a very special, almost sacred quality that the English word for *Virāga*, which is sometimes translated as "fading away" and sometimes as "dispassion," doesn't really capture the richness of the associations or the way it feels in Pali.

The same thing with *Niroda*—such a rich word that in the original context, I think it really felt like a heartwarming idea that you don't get from the English translations. The most common translation for *Niroda* is "cessation," and cessation, just ending, doesn't really bring for most of us much heartfelt feeling, inspiration, or joy. It just seems like, okay, it's the ending of something.

The word *Niroda* comes from the prefix *ni*, which means "without," "not," or "free from," and *rodha*, which means "obstruction." So, it's being "without obstruction." Cessation is a very different feeling than "free of obstruction." Maybe the cessation of obstructions, the cessation of blockages, clinging, or contraction—what gets in the way of freedom.

The 14th step, the fading away, the dispassion, involves the fading away and the ceasing, the ending of attachments, of cravings, of conceits, of the compulsive ways of being that have a definite feeling of stress and maybe even pain associated with them. The pain and stress of those become more and more apparent the more wonderfully and beautifully quiet and still the mind becomes in meditation. The more calm we are, the more they stand out, highlighting them as, "Wow, this is kind of uncomfortable to feel this way." In ordinary street consciousness, we might not feel it and might even say, "What's the big deal? It's okay to have a little bit of irritation." But in deep meditation, a little bit of irritation doesn't feel like a little bit; it feels like a real disruption and, more importantly, an obstruction to deeper peace and deeper freedom.

So, the 15th step is: one trains, "observing cessation, one will breathe in." "Observing cessation, one will breathe out." "Observing non-obstruction, one will breathe in." "Observing non-obstruction, one will breathe out."

As we get deeper and deeper, at some point, we observe a sacred absence. We observe the absence of something, and the absence is so strong, it's really noteworthy. It's deeply inspiring. With watching inconstancy, we're watching things come and go; they arise and they pass. We are in the river, the flow of transiency. But as we do that, the attachment to reaching into that river of change begins to give up, to relax. And with that, something ceases, something stops, something is no longer there to obstruct the freedom.

That absence is not just a temporary absence, like it fades and then comes back a second later, or fades away and comes back a minute later. There's a way in which the cessation, the ending of it, the absence of it, is really impactful for the mind and the heart. "Wow, it's possible to really be free of cynicism." "Wow, you know, I've been cynical for decades. Wow, this is possible." Or, "I've always been preoccupied, self-preoccupied with self." "Wow, this preoccupation with me, myself, and mine has fallen away, and it's not here. I can look around, where is it? It's not there." Wow, it's absent, it's ceased. There's a non-obstruction now. I realize that self-preoccupation was a kind of obstruction, or wind drag, or something.

Jealousy, doubt, hatred, resentment, all kinds of desires that are sometimes there in the structure of how our mind works, so embedded, like fear. And wow, this has ceased for now. It might come back the next day, it might come back at the end of the meditation, but there's something about the thoroughness of that absence which makes an impression. And then, I know this is possible. I had no idea this was possible. And of course, this is like coming home, or this is health, or this is my birthright. This is worthwhile, this is fantastic. Any movement away from it, any way of picking up the compulsion, that's a diminishment. That's not really worth it anymore. That's not the direction to go. This is how I want to live, without these obstructions, this kind of stress.

When this sense of absence is really impactful and strong enough, when it's a very, very deep, thorough absence, then a person will never be the same again. It's almost as if that absence is a living memory or presence that acts as a guide. "Oh, this is where freedom is. This is where peace is. This is where truth is." Not propositional truth, but just the true way of being. And then it becomes an orientation for how to live our life.

To say it in a different way, the tradition says one has then entered into the current, the good current, the current that takes us to full freedom. So we're in the river of change, the river of transiency, but we've now discovered that there's a place that's not in the eddies, that's not in the brambles growing into the side of the river. We notice, maybe in the center of the river, there's a beautiful current that, if we stay in it, will carry us to what the tradition, using this analogy, calls the ocean of liberation and freedom.

So I call this the sacred absence, the absence of, and to recognize the value of absence. This is a hard thing for many people to appreciate, that absence has importance. You can watch the mind and see, as soon as there's a quiet moment, it seems like the mind just reaches out for the next thing to think about. Or we have certain problems, and as soon as that problem is solved, the mind just goes on to the next thing, and the next, and the next. The mind is filling itself all the time. But to appreciate absence, cessation, this deep, sacred pause or stopping, and let it impact us—wow, it's true. So it's possible to be free.

It's a little disappointing for people who always want to have something that's reassuring, something that's a confirmation that they're important, they're valuable, that they're on the right track, that they can have the badge to tell their friends, "Look, I have this beautiful spiritual quality or something." An absence is not a badge you can put on. Absence is not the presence of something. Our ability to be present for things in the world may become stronger, but freedom is not something tangible. It's not something that the mind can focus on as an object of attention in the usual way that we can see and touch and feel things. And so it's very easy to overlook absences or to diminish their importance.

In fact, in the history of Buddhism in the ancient world, there were debates and big concerns. Some great Buddhist teachers couldn't understand how an absence could be the ultimate goal, how the ultimate freedom of Buddhism was somehow represented by an absence. It had to be a thing. And they posited a variety of different kinds of transcendent states and experiences because it had to be a thing.

So whether that's true or not is beside the point. What I'm trying to say now, in the 15th step of mindfulness of breathing, is about observing absence, observing cessation, observing a space of non-obstruction. Observing how, with the fading away of the passion, lust, clinging, and craving, at some point the stopping, the cessation, is so full. Sometimes it happens like a quantum shift, wow, and sometimes it happens slowly, fading away. And it might be just one thing—it might be cynicism or it might be doubt, but something that's been plaguing us for a long time, boom. Wow, we notice this is possible.

And it is possible. The Buddha made this great statement, and I'm paraphrasing him: "If it was not possible to bring an end to our unwholesome mental qualities, I wouldn't teach you to bring them to an end. But it is possible to bring unwholesome mental qualities to an end, to cessation. And so I teach you that this is possible."

This 15th step is an encouragement to appreciate absence, to appreciate sacred absence. Take time recognizing when a preoccupation, when greed, when anger, when desire, when lust, when anything that involves the mind contracting, the heart contracting—notice it, and appreciate when it's not there. And that appreciation will allow it to grow, or allow you to feel some confidence about this and keep making space, that sacred space, that sacred openness of attention to be more present and more here. That supports this whole process of furthering along the onward-leading aspect of this path of practice.

So, breathing in, observing cessation. Breathing out, observing cessation.

Thank you all. And may you appreciate all the absences that occur to you today that will enliven you, or just delight you, benefit you, open you, free you. And there are probably much more absences that are the door to step through today than you realize. May you appreciate the sacred absence today. Thank you.

[^1]: **Niroda (Pāli):** Often translated as "cessation." The speaker breaks it down into *ni* ("without") and *rodha* ("obstruction"), interpreting it as "the absence of obstruction" or the cessation of that which obstructs freedom, like craving and clinging. It is the third of the Four Noble Truths, referring to the cessation of suffering (*dukkha*).
[^2]: **Virāga (Pāli):** Often translated as "fading away," "dispassion," or "detachment." It refers to the fading away of craving, passion, and lust, which is a key element leading to liberation. It is the 14th step in the 16-step practice of mindfulness of breathing (*Ānāpānasati*).
