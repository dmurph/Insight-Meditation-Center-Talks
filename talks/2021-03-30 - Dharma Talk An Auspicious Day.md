Welcome to our Monday night Dharma talk. What I had in mind today is to maybe unpack this poem a little bit together and just reflect upon this poem that I just read.

I said that this poem's title is sometimes translated as "A Single Excellent Night" or "An Auspicious Day." The first time I read this poem, I was very touched. Without knowing anything about this poem, the context of it, or its significance, I took this poem with me to various locations. I read this poem to a Dharma sister who was in a hospital bed, and I took this poem and read it at a memorial service. I took this poem to my heart; I memorized it and reflected upon it.

So maybe I'll read the poem one more time, and then we'll kind of unpack this together. I'll unpack one stanza at a time.

> It's an auspicious day.
>
> The Buddha said, "Don't chase the past or long for the future. The past is left behind, the future is not yet reached. Right where it is, have insight into whatever phenomenon is present, not wavering and not agitated. By knowing it, one develops the mind.
>
> Ardently do what should be done today. Who knows? Death may come tomorrow. There is no bargaining with mortality and his great army.
>
> Whoever dwells thus, ardent, active day and night," says the peaceful sage, "is one who has an auspicious day."

So, what does this mean to not chase the past or long for the future? The past is left behind; the future is not yet reached.

We all probably have experiences of this, where we might be chasing the past or longing for the future. For me, what immediately becomes vivid is how, for most of us, as we are getting older and older, we chase the youth that we used to have. We really long for the youth we had before.

During this pandemic, it's probably not hard to feel this kind of longing for the past or the future—the vacations that you used to have, where you could travel to different places. We can be chasing the past in this way, whatever accomplishments that we may have had in our earlier careers, work, job, or family. Or maybe even, you know, you were the dance champion in high school.

In the sutta—and this is the Majjhima Nikāya 131[^1] where this poem shows up—the Buddha explained this. How does one chase after the past? He said one gets carried away with the delight of, "In the past, I had such a form or such a body. In the past, I had such a feeling. In the past, I had such a perception. In the past, I had such a thought fabrication or mental formation. In the past, I had such a consciousness." This is called chasing after the past.

I don't know if everyone is familiar with this particular formula. In it, the Buddha is pointing at how one gets stuck in the past and gets carried away by it in ways that are related to ourselves through this list that's called the five aggregates.[^2] Those are the things that we often identify as ourselves, as "me." This is me.

I'm struck by the key word that's being used here by the Buddha. He defines how one chases the past by saying that one would "take delight" in the past. This form of taking delight could be really getting consumed by the past, in that it may be pleasant experiences we had before and who we were before in the past. This taking delight could also happen even when it's unpleasant experiences, an unpleasant history. We could be defined by those, and when we're being defined by them, we get hooked by the past.

Even when we do not like them, you know, sometimes I can see that I had a certain recognition that I used to be this way. I really didn't like it, but somehow, by being really annoyed by it, I actually get hooked by how I get myself identified with those things. So this is taking delight in the past, this way or that way, that defines how we are.

And how does one not chase after the past? The Buddha continued by saying, well, if one does not get carried away with the delight in the past—in that, "in the past I had this kind of form, or feelings, and perception, or the mental formations, or the consciousness"—then this is called not chasing after the past.

So the formula is quite simple. If we stop being consumed, stop taking delight in the past, we no longer have that kind of force in us to begin to chase the past anymore. So this recognition that there is a possibility, there is a choice not to get swept away in the past.

So how do we really do that? In our meditation practice, in our mindfulness practice, when we begin to notice that one is being hooked by the memory, by the history, by the stories that were lived in the past, that's when we begin to have a choice. We see, "Wow, you know, here I am, but I'm hooked by this story," and I recognize this is happening. When we begin to recognize that this is happening, this is where detaching from taking delight in them, or detaching from being attracted by the story of the past, we can begin to loosen the hook.

Often, what happens is when we're being mindful, we can, for example, rest our attention in the body, shifting from the stories of the past to what's happening in our body. Then the memory and the images that came from the past can simply become a kind of ripple that flows through our awareness. There's no need for the story of the memory and the past to take a foothold in us. So it's possible that our mind may have thoughts of the past or the stories, but they don't have to be a problem. It's when we begin to take delight in them and are really being consumed by them that we get swept away. But when we're aware, we can see the memories as simply memories. They flow through like clouds in the wide-open sky.

And similarly, how does one long for the future? The Buddha used a similar language. One gets carried away with the delight in the future: "I might become this way, I might become that way." And this becoming, as the sutta[^3] says, is called placing expectations on the future. We all have this kind of experience in our own lived experience, right?

There are lots of examples we can take. We're not comfortable with what is happening here and now. Sometimes we construct a future in our head, and then we hook onto this kind of constructed experience, and we really go after that to pull us out of what is happening in the present experience. So there's a form of expectations in the future; here's a construction. It is a form of mental construction, and we can believe in them so strongly that they become almost real for us.

And similarly, the Buddha explained how not to place expectations on the future. The same formula was prescribed: do not get carried away with the delight in the future.

It's easier said than done. We all know that, and it's very easy to fall into this form of taking delight. But what it takes is to become recognized that this is happening. You know, maybe expectation or projection is happening. And allow ourselves to then rest into the field of awareness, to simply notice projection being projection, and planning being planning, our expectations being expectations. Sometimes they're really momentary; maybe they're just one or two thoughts that come and go, just like a snap of the finger. But if we feed onto them, continue to plan and tell our stories, this can become something really big and take us away. But when we begin to see these expectations as simply being expectations, the thoughts as thoughts, there is a real sense of lightness in all of these experiences.

And so the next stanza, the Buddha brought us back to where it is, here and now. "Right where it is, have insight into whatever phenomena is present, not faltering and not agitated. By knowing it, one develops the mind."

It's this point that this moment is where we live. The present moment, the present experience, the present phenomenon is where we live. And this is where insight can happen, and this is where we practice. This is the field of our practice.

But very interesting though, in the sutta, it says that even in this practicing with the present experience, there can be two ways. One way is skillful, and one way is not very skillful. So when I first read this, I was kind of puzzled. Wow, you know, I thought being present would be all good and fine, but there can be a way that one will be present and there can still be unskillfulness in there. So how is that possible?

Let's take a look at this. What happens is, with respect to the present experiences, the present qualities, an unskilled person can take whatever is arising as "I," "me," "my." So what happens? Whatever is happening, in one unskillful way, is that we take that "this is me." For example, right now, if there is a little moment of sadness that happened in the field of emotion, one way to relate to this momentary sadness is, "I'm a sad person. I've always been sad. There's so much sorrow in me." Now what happens? We begin to construct myself in this simple moment of sadness, a moment of grief. "Oh my god, I am really miserable. I've always been very miserable. I don't know how to get out of this."

This is what the Buddha is pointing at. We can make "self" out of the momentary experience that's happening. And when we do this, what happens is we get hardened into these experiences, and this becomes more permanent than what it is.

Most of the time, our emotions flow up and down, this way and that way, throughout the day. But we can oftentimes hook onto certain forms of emotion and make it ourselves. I remember Gil Fronsdal[^4] sometimes would teach that it is more skillful to be situation-centric rather than self-centric. Or, you know, in another word, in this particular sutta, maybe we can say it's phenomenon-centric rather than self-centric. Whatever phenomena or situation that comes about in our present lived experience, we simply see this as the situation or the phenomenon. This is the skillful way of being with our experiences. The self-centric approach would be turning everything that is happening into something related to "I," "me," and "mine."

For example, if you drop a plate on the floor, maybe the immediate reaction would be, "I am so sloppy." But is it really all about you? Or is it just, well, this is a situation that just happened?

When we get identified with the situation, what happens is there can be a lot of dukkha,[^5] a lot of stress that comes along with it. Our experiences become stuck and no longer flow like the clouds in the sky.

The opposite is that if we're not taking this phenomenon and the situations as "I, me, mine," then there can be simple, transient, changing experiences arising and passing. When this happens, there can be a quality of not being wavered or shaken by agitation, by faltering. The agitation happens when there is a center, like the center of the self. When there is no center of self, the agitation cannot shake anything. There's nothing to shake.

So when one develops the mind in this way, the mind will no longer be shaky or restless.

And so the poem goes on by encouraging this. The next stanza says, "Ardently do what should be done today. Who knows? Death may come tomorrow. There's no bargaining with mortality and his great army."

I don't know what more is to be said about this particular line because it is true. We don't know. We don't know when death may come. It may not even be tomorrow; maybe the next moment. I know this can sound untrue, unreal, but we really don't know.

Oftentimes, our intellectual mind understands that, you know, when everybody gets born, death will be part of it. I think one of my teachers, Phillip Moffitt,[^6] sometimes would like to quote his teacher, Ajahn Sumedho,[^7] that "birth has death as a life sentence." And it's true, and yet we often live our lives with the complete denial that this might happen to us. It might happen anytime.

And so the Buddha knows this and knows the preciousness of practicing in this moment, here and now. So ardently do what should be done today. Ardently do what should be done right now, because we don't know.

And the poem ended with this line: "Whoever dwells thus, ardent, active day and night," says the peaceful sage, "one who has an auspicious day."

I love this definition because oftentimes we associate an auspicious day with some, I don't know, special days. Like yesterday, I know it's a full moon day, and even in the Buddhist tradition and maybe many different spiritual traditions, full moon days are considered to be an auspicious day. But the Buddha had a different definition for this. Whoever dwells thus, ardent, active day and night, practicing ardently day and night—this, says the peaceful sage, is the one who has an auspicious day.

I love it because this makes the practice very accessible. We don't have to wait for some special day in order to practice. This day, if we practice here and now, it's an auspicious day. The other translation: a single excellent night, or an excellent day.

And so we just need to become fully present, become aware of what is happening, cultivating our mind skillfully, seeing what's true right in front of us. This is where the peace lies, and this is where the freedom is found.

I'm going to close tonight by just reading this poem one more time. Maybe by now, the few lines have even sunk in you in some way.

May you all have an excellent night. So take good care.
