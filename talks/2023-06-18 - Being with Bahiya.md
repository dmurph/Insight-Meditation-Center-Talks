So for those of you who don't know, I'm Diana Clark, as Martha said there at the beginning, and it's a delight to be here with you all. Some of you may know that I teach on Monday nights, so here I am on a Sunday morning instead of a Monday night. But today, I'd like to share a little bit about a sutta[^1], my story specifically that's in a sutta.

Maybe I'll start by saying Gil and I taught a study course that ended up being almost two years; it just ended. A theme that we kept on pointing back to in so many different ways was the importance of direct experience—like what is happening right now, this moment, as opposed to our ideas about it, as opposed to some philosophy, as opposed to some mystical or metaphysical ideas. Just this encouragement to come back to what's actually happening in this moment. And it was quite something to see just how this showed up in the suttas in so many different ways. I would say that a big part of practice is learning to make this distinction. You might think, "Well, that's obvious. I know what I'm thinking and I know when I'm sensing," but it turns out this can be even more and more subtle—the way that our concepts, our notions, our ideas, our beliefs, our views are a little bit different than what's actually happening in this moment.

Of course, we do this. Of course, humans do this; they have ideas and views and opinions. Of course, they do. We need them. But there's so much a way in which we are often living in our heads instead of being embodied. There's a way that we are looking for the answers, we're looking for ease, we're looking for comfort, we're looking for happiness with something that's out there. And "out there" being something that's going to happen in the future, or in another setting, or anywhere but here, right? And "out there," of course, only exists in our minds; it doesn't happen right here in the moment.

If we're not looking for happiness and well-being or the end of suffering with something out there, then maybe it shows up as we're trying to figure something out. Like, "Everything is going to be okay as soon as I solve this problem," or maybe that problem. Have you noticed it never ends? And of course, we do this. Many of us in our professional lives or in certain education have been rewarded for this type of thinking: just solve the problem, the next problem, the next problem, the next problem, and everything will be fine. It's such a radical idea in some ways that this teaching is pointing to: can we just be with what the experience is here?

So many of you will be familiar with this sutta that I'll be talking about. It's the Bāhiya[^2] Sutta. And I'm going to kind of tell this story and then drop in some commentary as we go along.

The sutta begins, "Thus have I heard." Many of you know this is the common beginning, and maybe we could say, "Once upon a time," something like this. "Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī[^3] in Jeta's Grove[^4], Anāthapiṇḍika's Park." So many suttas start like this, where the Buddha is, kind of giving a setting.

"Now at that time, Bāhiya of the bark cloth was residing by Suppāraka[^5] on the ocean shore." So Bāhiya, he's in another place. The Buddha's over here, Bāhiya is over there. "Bāhiya was honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he received robes, alms food, lodging, and medicine and supplies for the sick." So they're kind of giving Bāhiya's credentials, you know, who is this person? He was a spiritual leader, a lot of people followed him, thought that he was a good leader. And this list—robes, alms, foods, lodgings, and medicine—those are the usual list of four things that spiritual leaders need, and in particular, Buddhist leaders need. They would say they need those four things and only those four things, but that's another story to talk about.

But maybe we'll also say that Bāhiya is not a Buddhist practitioner, and partly we know this because he's wearing bark cloth. So just in the same way that we can tell the difference between who's a layperson, who's a Theravāda monastic[^6], who's a Zen practitioner, who's a Tibetan monastic by what they're wearing, in the same way back at the time of the Buddha, we could also. So he's not a Buddhist practitioner, but he's this esteemed spiritual leader.

And then, coming back to the sutta, "When Bāhiya was alone in seclusion"—we can understand this as when he was meditating—"when he was alone in seclusion, this line of thinking appeared to his awareness: 'Now, of those who in this world are awakened or have entered the path of Awakening, am I one?'" He's wondering about his practice. He's wondering, "I think I'm awakened, and everybody else thinks I'm awakened, but am I really?"

So I appreciate this very much. Bāhiya, he's not complacent just because everybody thinks, "Oh yeah, okay, this guy is a leader, he's a spiritual leader. Of course, he has it all figured out. Of course, he's not trying to solve problems or not in the present moment or whatever it might be." Like all these things that kind of get projected onto spiritual leaders. But he wasn't buying all of it. And this question, "Am I really awakened?" Importantly, he allowed this doubt about his practice to be there. He didn't immediately push it away. He didn't immediately start thinking of other things, you know, distract himself. He had this willingness to stay present to that experience of having this doubt, which you can imagine was an uncomfortable experience to say, "Well, everybody thinks I am, but am I really?"

Maybe this is different than having some ideas of this imposter syndrome that sometimes—or maybe it is the same as an imposter syndrome that sometimes happens when people feel like, "Well, if people really knew me, they wouldn't think what they think about me." Maybe Bāhiya is doing this. Of course, I don't really know. But his willingness to stay present and to stay open, not to just collapse and close down when this doubt about his practice shows up, this willingness allows another voice to enter.

A continuation of the sutta: "Then a deva[^7] who had once been a relative of Bāhiya's, compassionate and desiring Bāhiya's welfare, and knowing with her own awareness the line of thinking that had arisen in Bāhiya's awareness..." So this deva knows what's going on in Bāhiya's mind. "...that deva went to Bāhiya and on arrival said to him: 'You, Bāhiya, are neither awakened nor have you even entered the path to Awakening. You don't even have the practice whereby you would become awakened or enter in the path of Awakening.'" You can imagine Bāhiya is like, "Oh, okay."

So here we go, we have a deva meeting Bāhiya in this sutta. I don't know exactly what devas are. Yes, there's different ways we might understand them. Some of them have this [idea of] disembodied entities. One thing that I do know is that in all the sutta teachings, the devas are just like humans in this sense that they are not awakened either. They're not completely... they're not like other Buddhas or something like this. But something I appreciate very much, and this is by Douglas Phillips, who's another Dharma[^8] teacher who teaches both in this tradition and in the Zen tradition, is the one way that he considers this deva is by the role that she plays, rather than what exactly a deva is. What's the function in the story of having a deva come and meet Bāhiya? And Douglas Phillips has this idea that the deva is the embodiment of feminine wisdom. Of course, I kind of like this, being a woman myself.

But there's a way in which we can imagine sometimes there's this masculine side of us that's trying to go get things, make it happen. And then there's this—we might say, this is a gross generalization, of course, right, a gross generalization and not accurate—but it's a way we might think about what the role of devas is. That then there's also kind of this feminine wisdom that's like, "Wait, is that the only thing that there is, this going and getting things?" And she challenges Bāhiya with this brutal honesty. This is kind of painful, like she just cuts to the chase: "Nope, you're not awakened, and you're not even gonna get awakened." So telling Bāhiya that despite his years of practice and despite him having all these admiring students, he's not even a beginner on the path.

Another way we might think of this idea of the feminine wisdom is that there's sometimes—making this distinction between masculine or feminine, no matter which gender we are—that there are sometimes aspects of ourselves that we're cutting off a little bit, that we're ignoring, not paying attention to. We can just drop this idea of feminine or masculine; there's just often parts of us that we are trying to avoid, that we're trying to pretend aren't there, and maybe even secretly wish that they'll go away.

So this is one way that Douglas Phillips is interpreting this deva. But no matter how we think about it, we might notice that maybe doubt has arisen in your practice too. Maybe you've had some ideas like, "Am I doing this right? Everybody else seems like they're awakened or on the brink of awakenment, and I'm here struggling with being lost in thoughts," or whatever it is that we might be struggling with at the moment. So we might have doubt about our capacities, we might have doubts about the teachings. What's this idea of devas? We might have doubt about the teacher. Do they really know what they're talking about? Does she really know what she's talking about? Or maybe we've had expectations about the results of this practice. We had this idea, "Okay, I'm just going to learn this meditation practice, and everything is going to be easier, my life is going to be better," and maybe it hasn't turned out exactly the way that you were hoping or wanted it to be. So maybe in some ways, we're kind of like Bāhiya.

But there's something here: what do we do when we have these doubts for our practice, or we have some indicators that we still have some work to do? There are two ways that we could approach this when this doubt arises. One is to go down the path of resignation, self-judgment, despair, bitterness, blaming, disdain. There's all kinds of words I could use here. And sometimes we might travel some distance down this path before we realize this actually is leading to more suffering, not to less suffering. This isn't making things better to have this blaming or collapsing or resignation. That's one way to go. Chances are all of us do some version of that, and I know I certainly did. Certainly earlier in my practice, I would just get angry at the teachers. These poor teachers, they didn't know what I was projecting onto them. I just thought it was their fault somehow that this was so hard and I didn't know how to do it, or I was getting lost or having difficulties. I thought if they would only be better teachers. Now I'm one of those teachers, right? I can tell you we don't have all the answers for everybody. We have to find our own way, of course we do.

And that's the second path, or the second response we could have. When we discover that there's some difficulties, we could, rather than the path of blaming or self-judgment, go down the path of practice. That is, we could bring attention to our experience at that moment. This is what doubt feels like. This is what blaming feels like. This is what despair feels like. This is what feeling confused and angry and not even sure I want to do this practice anymore feels like. It feels like this, and it's uncomfortable. So there's a way in which we can just bring our practice to our experience, which, to be sure, might be the precise thing we don't want to do. But this is what's been asked of us: not to be somebody different, not to have different experiences, but to be with what's arising as best we can.

So if we do have some doubts about not only our experience but about the teachings or the teachers, what can we do? We can be with our experience, but bring it with a sense of curiosity. Do some investigation, talk to a teacher, read Dharma books, listen to Dharma talks, talk to other people. There's so many ways in which we can maybe share our experience in a way that feels comfortable for us. That is a part of the practice. I would say for me, I certainly would not have stayed with this practice if it weren't for some friends that I had along this Dharma path to share the difficulties and, after Dharma talks, to talk about things like, "What? I didn't get it. Did you get it?" you know, this kind of thing, or to just share ideas.

And maybe the last thing I'll say about this is that when we're having difficulties, to engage with the practice and to bring some curiosity about it—maybe some of you will recognize this as investigation. Many of you will know that investigation is a factor of Awakening. It's an integral part of this path towards Awakening. So it's not like something that we do on the side until we can get back to the real practice. It *is* the practice to bring some curiosity, some just being present, like, "What's going on here?" to what's actually happening.

Okay, to get back to the sutta. So the deva just told him, "Okay, you're not awakened and you're not even going to be awakened." And I give Bāhiya a lot of credit because here's what happens next: without hesitation, Bāhiya asked the deva, "But who in this world is awakened or has entered the path to Awakening?" And she said, "Bāhiya, in the northern city of Sāvatthī lives the Blessed One, the Buddha, a rightly self-awakened one. He is truly awakened, and he teaches the Dharma that leads to Awakening."

Then Bāhiya, deeply chastened by the deva, left Suppāraka and traveled all the way to where the Buddha was staying. To put this in context, this is thousands of years ago, and the distance between where Bāhiya was and where the Buddha was is over a thousand miles. He had to walk. Maybe he had a chariot part of the way or some of the way, I don't know, but a thousand miles is a long time, right? Before there's roads or pavements, it doesn't exist yet. But Bāhiya undergoes this; he has this commitment and he's willing to travel this distance. In my mind, adding this little detail into the story is pointing to the amount of commitment that Bāhiya has. He really wants to get awakened.

So Bāhiya doesn't defend or rationalize, "But everybody else thinks I'm awakened, are you sure?" Instead, he says, "Well, if I don't have it, where can I find it?" And then he goes to see if he can find it. So he travels to where the Buddha is, and getting back to the sutta, there Bāhiya found a number of monks doing walking meditation outside. He went directly up to them and asked, "Where, venerable sirs, is the Buddha staying? I must see him immediately." He has this urgency. And then he was told that the Buddha had gone into the city for alms round. Of course, the monastics every day are getting alms, so the Buddha wasn't at the place where other monastics were; he was in the town.

So Bāhiya hurried immediately to the city, where he found the Buddha on alms round. The Buddha was moving with great calm, his mind at peace, tranquil and poised. This is how Buddhas are. Bāhiya approached the Buddha, threw himself to the ground before him, and with his head at the Buddha's feet, he said, "Teach me the Dharma, Blessed One. Teach me the Dharma, O Holy One, so that it will be for my long-term welfare and happiness." The Buddha replies, "This is not the time, Bāhiya. We have entered the town for alms." So in an irreverent way, in my mind, he's saying, "I'm on my lunch break, come back later."

I'm sure the Buddha would be a little bit different, but you know, that's kind of what happened, right? And recognizing that at this time, the Buddha only ate one time a day, so he needs to eat, he needs to have a meal every day. But Bāhiya pleaded with the Buddha a second time, "But Holy One, it is hard to know for sure what dangers there may be for the Buddha's life or what dangers there may be for my life. Please teach me the Dharma, O Blessed One, so that I may be happy and free." So Bāhiya is saying, "No, no, teach me now, because you know, we don't know what's going to happen in the next moment."

Again, the Buddha tried to put off Bāhiya, saying that it wasn't the right time to teach because this is the alms round. But Bāhiya is persistent. He has a certain amount of diligence, but he also recognizes impermanence, this recognition that we're not guaranteed a next moment. None of us are, not even Buddhas. Even though we might be thinking, "Okay, I'll be doing this later, later everything will be fine, later I'll figure that out, later I'll practice, later I'll be with my present moment experience," Bāhiya has enough wisdom to recognize, "No, we don't actually know what's going to happen the next moment." So he's respectful but tenacious.

The sutta continues. Bāhiya pleaded his case a third time. And this is a common theme that we see in the suttas. It's very interesting, and I don't know the origins or the story around this, but it's common that if you ask a Buddha three times, after the third time, he will relent. Just keep that in your back pocket the next time you meet a Buddha.

Bāhiya pleaded his case a third time, and this time the Buddha relented and said, "Well then, Bāhiya, you should train like this: In the seen will be merely the seen. In the heard will be merely the heard. In the sensed will be merely the sensed. In the cognized will be merely the cognized."

So the Buddha is pointing to just being with the present moment experience. "Cognized" we could have that stand for all whatever mental events are happening in the mind. "Sensed" we could say there's a shorthand for any senses in addition to seeing and hearing. So when seeing or hearing is happening, just to be only seeing or hearing or sensing or having mental events.

We might say that a big part of practice is discovering all the extra, quote-unquote, things that we do besides just being with our experience. Sometimes the experience is uncomfortable, and then as we spoke about earlier, there might be this, "But I don't want it to be here," and then there's a whole story-making that happens. Many of you might be familiar with this idea of papañca[^9], this mental proliferation that often starts with something really pleasant or unpleasant. Then there's a way in which the mind wants more, and it starts to make a story about how it wants more. "I want this," or "I don't want that," or "This reminds me of the time that XYZ," or "This means something about me." This often happens, and then we're no longer with the present moment; instead, we're off, lost in our stories. So the Buddha's pointing to the importance of just staying with the present moment experience.

Then the sutta continues. It's more than just being with the present moment experience. The Buddha says, "And when you have trained in that way—in the seen will be merely the seen, in the heard will be merely the heard, in the sensed will be merely the sensed, in the cognized will be merely the cognized—then, Bāhiya, there is no 'you' in connection with that. And when there is no 'you' in connection with that, there is no 'you' there. And when there is no 'you' there, there is no 'you' here, nor yonder, nor in between. And just this is the end of suffering."

Upon hearing this brief explanation from the Buddha, Bāhiya's mind was immediately freed from the defilements, from grasping, and he became an arahant[^10]. So you might wait and wonder, like, "Wait, what happened there?" What the Buddha is pointing to is that imputing a sense of self or having this self-concept is extra, and it's associated with suffering. So we might consider the Buddha's description of "when the seen is just the seen" or "the hearing is just the hearing" might be a description of what it means when there isn't this self-concept that's getting overlaid on top of our experience. This idea that there is a pattern of experience, but there's no entanglement with it, there's no papañca that's happening after it.

As an example, you might have noticed that sometimes during meditation sessions, the most peaceful, the most delightful part of the whole meditation session is when the bell rings at the end. Because at that moment, there's a little "huh," and any doing that was being done—like there's a meditator here that's trying to meditate, or "I'm meditating"—for that moment when the bell rings, that sense of "Oh, I have to meditate" gets put down. There's this kind of relaxation, this little bit of a just an opening, like, "Oh, okay, now what's next?" But before there's the "I finished that," that moment, there can be this peacefulness. At the next meditation session, notice what happens at the moment when the bell rings. There often is this opening, this relaxation, this ease, because at that time, the mind isn't doing anything. You're not trying to meditate, you're not trying to be a meditator, nothing needs to happen right at that moment. And it might just be a flash or a flicker, but just notice how at that time there's this peacefulness or this delightfulness.

But not only is there no longer this sense of somebody who's doing this meditation, but at that moment also the reactivity and the measuring has been quieted or dropped. There's often such a subtle way—in fact, it might be so subtle and so constant and familiar we might not even recognize it—but there's a way when often when we're meditating or we're trying to meditate, there's this subtle way in which there's a, "I like this more than that." "Oh, it was better yesterday. What am I going to do tomorrow so I can have this experience again?" or "I don't like this as much as that." There's this subtle measuring or comparing or a sense of "me" trying to make things happen that gets tangled up with our experience.

And what the Buddha is pointing to is that's extra. We don't actually have to do that. That doesn't need to happen. In fact, that can get quieter and quieter and quieter. And usually, this is how it happens: this extra is on a spectrum. Sometimes it's so obvious, like, "I don't like this, please make it go away. I hate this. When is that bell gonna ring?" And there can be a really strong sense of, "I want something in particular to happen." Or it could be a really quiet, just every now and then there's a thought that floats up like, "Oh yeah, this is nice. I hope it stays like this. Wow, look at me, I'm meditating." There can be something like this. It can be really, really strong or really, really subtle. It's not a binary on or off when this extra is added.

So this reactivity, this measuring, this entanglement is caused, we might say, by the self-concept. That there's this idea of a self that, because of the self, wants things to be a particular way, wants things to be pleasant and comfortable. And it's this way of trying to bolster and protect this notion of this core or this notion of an essence that underlies suffering. And whether that suffering is just stress or uncomfortableness or just flat-out awfulness, it's this self-concept at the beginning, at the sense of this being at the core, that is the source that's fueling the reactivity, it's fueling the suffering.

So whatever is happening, in whatever moment, in each moment, whatever is happening, this can be the entry point of practice. Learning to live fully in the life that we have, not in some imagined future or remembered past, but living to just be here. "Oh yeah, this is what sensing feels like. Seeing is like this. Hearing is like this." Whether you're in a meditative state, whether you're in a meditation posture, whether you're just washing the dishes or driving or whatever it might be, whatever your experience is, this can be a doorway to practice. And just to be with the seeing or the hearing or whatever mental experience is happening, and freedom is possible right there at that moment. We don't have to wait for some imagined, you know, perfect conditions. Whatever is happening, right there we can be with the experience. And maybe it's just a moment, a flicker of a little bit more ease, but this is exactly how the practice unfolds: with a tasting or a recognition of, "Oh yeah, there's a little bit more ease this direction when I'm just with the experience. There's less ease this direction when I'm adding on all the thoughts and ideas of how I should be or how this experience should be."

So being with our experience in the life we actually have can be the doorway to greater freedom. Thank you.
